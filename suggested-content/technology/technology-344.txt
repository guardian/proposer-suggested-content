Google has reported an 18% rise in first-quarter profit, disappointing analysts who are increasingly concerned about the company's aggressive expansion strategy and lavish spending.Google's first-quarter earnings of $2.3bn (£1.4bn), or $7.04 a share, for the quarter ended 31 March came in below analyst projections as the internet search leader accelerated recruitment hiring and spending in other areas, driving up its expenses.The company's shares shed $27.74, or nearly 5% on Thursday, to $550.77 in extended trading. These results are likely to heighten investor fears that Google's earnings will suffer because of the company's commitment to hire at least 6,200 workers this year. That would be the most in its 13-year history.Google co-founder Larry Page, who replaced Eric Schmidt as CEO after the quarter ended, has indicated he plans to keep investing in long-term opportunities that may take years to pay off, even if that affects the short-term results.Page offered a determinedly optimistic view of the figures. "I'm very excited about Google and our momentum, and I'm very, very optimistic about our future," he said. He insisted that the management transition Google announced three month ago is unfolding as planned, with Page overseeing day-to-day operations while Schmidt handles government relations and stalks possible acquisition targets in his new role as executive chairman.If not for the cost of employee stock rewards, Google said it would have earned $8.08 a share. The company hired 1,916 staff, taking its workforce over 26,300. Half of the new staff are working on products and services to supplement search advertising, which makes most of Google's money.
It's obvious, innit? Spotify's announcement that it is going to limit free use on its music streaming service (although not for users who pay) must mean one of three things:• it's on a membership drive, trying to push more people to hand over their cash instead of freeloading• it's trying to cut its bandwidth costs – with a million users that would be hefty, even with all sorts of compression and local storage tricks• it's trying to cut its payments to the record labels – for each track it plays, it has to pay out a tiny amount of moneySo it must be one or all of those things in some combination, right?Here's Spotify's response: "To be clear, this is in no way a conversion drive. Neither is it to reduce bandwidth costs or to reduce payments to rights holders."So what's left? Though it won't say so, Spotify's move is actually being done to prepare for its entry into the US market.This may provoke some headscratching for those unused to the strange ways of the music industry, where when the talk is not of how wonderfully Adele's newandold albums are selling, then it's about which territories the music is licensed in. Because music is treated just like books, which are also licensed for sale in different territories – despite the fact that music long since ceased relying on physical incarnations. (Books aren't exactly troubled by them that much now, but the physical incarnation still has advantages.)To put it bluntly: Spotify is cutting the amount of free music people can listen to in order to please the American labels with which it is agonisingly negotiating to try to get permission to launch in the US. The fact is that the labels there – and for that matter in Europe – don't like Spotify allowing people to listen to so much music for free (even though Spotify pays them the stipulated amount per track, whether the customer is listening for free or on a paid subscription).Yet the US labels don't have much to crow about. It's hardly as if their approach has led to the land of milk and honey for subscription services. First, they were completely screwed up by Microsoft's Janus software (remember that?), which barely worked. Apple completed an end-run (as it's known there) around all their attempts and triumphed in the straight download business. Napster, now owned by Best Buy, struggles on with an unknown number of subscribers worldwide, while the biggest US subscription service is actually Rhapsody, run by Real Networks, which has 700,000 – after having been around for a decade. (Lest you object and say "Pandora!" – that's not a subscription service: it's actually an internet radio service. You can't choose the songs that come up on Pandora. Ditto for CBS-owned Last.fm.)Spotify, let's remember, has been around for about two and a half years and has a million paying subscribers. It's made subscription music actuallywork.That, however, doesn't cut any mustard with the record labels, which combine the obstinacy of the average mule with the herding instincts of cats. All they want to see is, ideally, everyone on any service that hasn't crawled under the wire and classified itself as "radio" (at which point they evade the labels' grasp) to be a paying customer. Because it used to be that way – you either listened to music on the radio or you bought the 45rpm vinyl single or the 33rpm vinyl album – and so it should remain that way.That overlooks the reality, which is that the internet's openness means that if you can't get your music for a low cost in one place, then you'll find someone ignoring the rules and offering it for free somewhere else.It also ignores the reality about the effect Spotify has on digital revenues for the music business. It's the second single largest source of digital music revenue for labels in Europe, according to IFPI's latest report. And last week, Billboard magazine reported that countries where Spotify is licensed saw an average digital revenue growth rate of 43% in 2010. By contrast, neighbouring countries – including Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Portugal and Switzerland – saw only 9.3% digital growth last year. That's based on IFPI data too.So what's eating the labels? Simply, they don't like having to face up to the digital reality. They do have control of the music licences, which means they can hold the biggest companies to ransom – and that includes Apple, Google and Amazon, which all want to introduce streaming services, and would do so in a heartbeat if they could only get the labels to sign.The ransom they're expecting to be paid and the amount that they're actually going to get paid are a long way apart. The hostage isn't worth the ransom; Apple can do fine from its download service via iTunes, which helps sell a few more iPods, but what it's really waiting to do is use itunes.com as a pure streaming service.Amazon's launch of its sort-of cloud music service(where you have to upload the music that you might have bought as a CD a few days ago from Amazon, but over a much slower upload connection) is a nice idea, but impossible for the average person to cope with. Google is waiting, too, but can't get all the labels to sign up.At some point, sanity may intrude; record labels are getting used to having less money coming in. Subscription services could mean even less money in the short term, yet lots in the longer terms as all of Google, Amazon and Apple – and Spotify – tempt everyone to play music they choose all the time, all over the place.In the meantime, for disaffected Spotify users, there's alsowe7, whose chief executive, Steve Purdham, says happily: "People who want an alternative can come to us." Ad-supported, with subscriptions, it's like Spotify – but British.
Games industry body the IGDA has sent an "important advisory" to its members warning them to "educate themselves on the pros and cons of submitting content to Amazon", for its newAndroid-focused mobile apps store.Its main concern in the letter – a copy of which has been passed to the Guardian's Apps Blog (update: and nowpublished online by IGDA) – is the way Amazon reserves the right to pay developers either 70% of the purchase price for their games, or 20% of the developer's List Price, whichever is the greater."While many other retailers, both physical and digital, also exert control over the price of products in their markets, we are not aware of any other retailer having a formal policy of paying a supplier just 20% of the supplier's minimum list price without the supplier's permission," explains the IGDA's advisory.It also outlines five possible scenarios which it thinks should worry Android game developers. That includes a situation in which Amazon cuts the price of its 100 most popular games by as much as 75%. "Some developers will probably win in this scenario, but some developers – most likely, those near the bottom of the list – will lose, not gaining enough sales to offset the loss in revenue per sale."The second concern is over a stipulation that developers can only set a minimum list price that matches their lowest price on any rival app store. "Amazon has presented developers with a stark choice: abandon Amazon's market or agree never to give another distributor an exclusive promotional window," claims the email.The IGDA also worries that those other app stores may feel compelled to match Amazon's terms, leading to "a slippery slope in which a developer's 'minimum list price' ceases to be a meaningful thing", and expresses concern over the prospect that Amazon could steeply discount or make free a game with a "well-defined, well-connected niche audience", thus robbing the developer of revenues from those people who might buy its game at a higher price.The fifth scenario outlined in the letter focuses on Amazon being able to discount or make free a game that is already selling well. "This sort of promotional activity may attract consumers away from competing markets and into Amazon's arms. But it might actually represent a net loss for the developer, which was already doing quite well and didn't need to firesale its game at that moment in time."The IGDA wants Amazon to change its terms, requiring permission from a developer before it offers their games at a discount, and also to give them the freedom to set whatever minimum list price they want – regardless of how much their games are selling for in other stores. However, it admits that "while Amazon has been very willing to engage with the IGDA, it has thus far expressed zero willingness to adjust its distribution terms".The IGDA letter also warns developers against seeing Amazon as a plucky upstart in the apps world. "It would be foolish to assume that because Amazon's Appstore is small today, it will not become the Walmart of the Android ecosystem tomorrow."We approached Amazon for comment on the letter, but the company had not provided a response at the time of publication.Developers have broadly welcomed the launch of Amazon's Appstore for Android, since it ties into Amazon's powerful recommendation engine, and also because it's making games playable in emulated form so people can try before they buy. There has been relatively little public criticism of the store's terms, but the IGDA clearly feels developers need to pay more attention to the small print.
I want to download a large collection of videos to my computer, and I've read about video capture cards. I'm using an iMac. Is this feasible, and if so, what else would I require?BMYou don't say if these videos are on VHS cassettes, but if they are, the simplest way to digitise them is to buy a DVD recorder. This will enable you to play a tape and record it to DVD without using a computer. This is not a flexible approach but it does the job.Converting analogue video to a digital format requires fast connections and a lot of processing power: PCI video capture cards solve both problems. Intel iMacs don't have PCI slots so you will have to use an external device instead. However, iMacs do have FireWire 800 ports, which are faster than USB 2 ports, if you need the extra bandwidth.The video capture device will convert the analogue video signal from a TV, VHS video recorder or other source into a digital format that iMovie can store and edit. Generally, the more you pay, the better the result. Some devices also include TV tuners. Have a look at theCanopus ADVC-55 A/D Converter External, which works with FireWire, and Elgato's EyeTV range.Elgato'sVideo Capture Mac/Winlooks like a simple, cheap option. According to the spec sheet, it supports video resolutions of 640 x 480 (4:3) or 640 x 360 (16:9) and the H.264 and MPEG-4 video formats. The more expensive Canopus equivalent is theADVC Mini. A cheaper option is theClimaxDigital VCAP800. All these devices use USB 2 ports instead of FireWire.You will need to make sure that you can connect your VCR, camcorder or other video source to the external converter. Possible options include RCA, S-Video and SCART cables. Some converters come with cables.It should also be possible to digitise video directly, now that most graphics chips and Intel Core iX Sandy Bridge processors include hardware support for video encoding and decoding. I don't currently have access to a Sandy Bridge-based PC so I don't know how effective this is, but if anyone has tried it, let us know how well it works. I'd still expect an external converter (or PCI card) to be worth the cost, if you have a lot of video convert, and if you want a good quality result.There are drawbacks to digitising videos. The most obvious is that it takes a lot of time, because you have to play all the way through each video, even if you don't sit around watching it. Also, video takes up a lot of room so you will need plenty of hard drive space. Finally, VHS tapes are not particularly good quality by today's standards, and your transfers may include variable colours, irritating speckles and other artefacts. You may need to do some video editing to improve them. It's worth the effort for videos that have a lot of sentimentalvalue – weddings and kids' birthday parties, for example. It may not be worth it for movies that are easily replaceable, especially since most include copy protection.
YouTube is to invest €500,000 (£441,000) in a scheme to support UK digital talent.The YouTube NextUp fund will allow up to 25 people to win a €20,000 grant to develop their content on the video-sharing website, as well as a place at a "creator camp" that will give training in production techniques.To apply, creators must be YouTube partners – content producers who earn revenue through their accounts. YouTube said they could include singers, dancers, actors, producers, musicians or makeup artists who create their own video content.Speaking to YouTube partners at a launch event held in partnership with the British Film Institute, the BFI's audiovisual manager, Claire Geddie, said its aim was to promote UK talent to the world and support developing film-makers."Channels like YouTube offer new tools and ways to get your content seen, and using online channels should be a key part of your personal and organisational strategy," Geddie added.YouTube claimed its UK partners have seen a 45% increase in uploads since 2010, and that 154% of revenues from partner channels have been given back to creators.The number of partners earning more than $10,000 a year has increased seven-fold in a year, according to the company.YouTube is ramping up its spending on original content in a bid to take on the rise of internet TV; it wasreported last weekthat the site is in talks with Hollywood studios and programme-makers.
The PSN and Xbox Live stores aren't exactly short on twin-stick shooters. This old favourite genre, in which players use one stick to move and one to fire, has already been exhumed via the likes of (deep breath) Assault Heroes,Alpha Squad,Microbot,Inferno,Zombie Apocalypse,Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,Aqua: Naval Warfareand Geometry Wars (and relax). There's something about the combination of top-down 2D visuals, hardcore shooting action and retro appeal that makes this gametype a fertile hunting ground for indie studios.The latest entry isGatling Gearsfrom Amsterdam-based developer,Vanguard Games, which has followed Klei Entertainment and Hothead Games into Electronic Art's Partners programme. Due out on PC, PSN and Xbox 360 soon, this mecha-flavoured steam punk romp is set on a once beautiful planet that's gone through a hyper-accelerated industrial revolution, leaving it with a shattered ecology and a lot of steam-powered robots and fighting vehicles charging about the bespoiled countryside. At the centre of the destruction is an evil Empire intent on wringing out the last of the world's resources. Now, a retired pilot from the Empire's own army of mech commanders must stand against his ex-employer.What this sets up is an intense blast-'em-up, where players clamber into robot walkers and ceaselessly pound waves of enemy tanks, choppers and war bots, each of which are quite happy to ceaselessly pound right back. The three weapons are a chain gun, which has unlimited ammo but limited damage and range; a canon that fires powerful long-range projectiles; and a grenade launcher. Each of these can be upgraded as you pick up cash in the game world, plus there are temporary power-ups which massively boost the capabilities of specific weapons for a set period. Oh, and when it all gets too much, a smart bomb option, limited to one per level, will helpfully obliterate everything on screen.It's a familiar foundation, then, but what really works in Gatling Gears' favour is its impressively detailed visual style. The player controlled mechs look and move like the scout walkers from Return of the Jedi, stomping over the landscape with a lovely loping stride. Each vehicle is packed with intricate moving parts, from revolving guns to opening turrets and there's a huge array of enemies, escalating in size from lone soldiers with rocket launchers to mammoth drop ships that crunch out of the sky spitting venomous fire in all directions. Each of the six chapters ends with a boss battle; I got to play one against a giant hovering craft that zooms out of a ravine and fills the screen with laser blasts – there's a real bullet hell feel about the encounter.Each chapter features a different landscape type taking in the usual range of frozen wastelands, scorched deserts, and lush green fields. Each has a high level of destructibility, so buildings and natural obstacles are blasted to fragments during the chaos.At EA's recent showcase event in London, I played through the countryside chapter and enjoyed the brawling madness, with helicopters swooping down and tanks rolling in over rickety wooden bridges. The only slight pain is the grenade, which requires you to hold down a button, aim a reticule at where you want the projectile to land, and then release. It's fiddly, inaccurate and time-consuming, and your shields (which can also be upgraded, thankfully) often take a sizeable battering while you're lining up a shot.The game will be best experienced in the two-player co-op mode, which can be enjoyed locally or online. It felt a lot like the Bitmap Brothers' seminal Amiga shooter Chaos Engine to me, especially with the similar steam punk styling. No bad thing at all.
Goodness knows how many hours of work were wasted to this yesterday, but it looks likeThe World's Biggest Pac-Manis becoming a internet gaming phenomenon. Announced yesterday at theMicrosoft MIX Developer Conference, this is a fascinating new version of Namco's legendary arcade game, which links together hundreds of fan-made levels. Users need to sign-up via Facebook Connect if they want to construct their own mazes, but anyone can visit the site, click on a map and enjoy some retro-flavoured pill-scoffing fun.The game was developed by media agencySoap Creativein conjunction with Microsoft and Namco. Although it is designed to showcase Internet Explorer 9, it'll run on any browser that supports HTML 5, the new multimedia-friendly version of the staple web programming language, which is set to compete with Flash astheplatform for browser-based gaming. Combining social media, user-generated content and a device-agnostic development platform, this is pretty much a roadmap of where web games are going.So far, 1350 mazes have been generated, with 16,597,858 Pac-dots eaten and 86,933 lives lost. If you have important things to do in the office today, do not go anywhere near this site.
The analysts clearlybelieve the Windows Phone OS has a bright future, but how about app developers? Microsoft made its latest pitch this week at itsMIX11 conferencein Las Vegas, giving attendees another look at the next version of Windows Phone, and the development features around it.The company's corporate vice president of Windows Phone program management, Joe Belfiore, says that the key aim is to help developers make apps that are "even faster, more capable and better integrated with Windows Phone", while also promising to put developers "at the forefront of 'what's next'".It's a slightly gruesome soundbite – in my experience, a lot of developers are resistant to jam-tomorrow rhetoric, preferring to seek their fortunes at the forefront of what's making money right now. Even so, the messages and demos coming out of MIX11 show Microsoft's continuing efforts to try to position itself as a credible counterpart to iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Symbian and webOS.Some of the new features for Windows Phone are playing catch-up to those platforms. Application multitasking for background processing, audio and file transfer and fast app switching for example – something that should have really been in Windows Phone 7 at launch. Likewise providing access to the camera and motion sensor library, with Microsoft highlighting augmented reality as one of the key areas to benefit.In other ways, Microsoft wants to get developers tying their apps more deeply into its mobile OS – for example, by making use of its Live Tiles feature to display more information on the home screens of Windows Phone handsets. The company already wants developers to make their apps fit neatly into the visual aesthetic of Windows Phone 7.The results are good for users, but arguably riskier for Microsoft if it increases the perception among some developers that taking apps to WP7 requires more investment.But credibility remains the main message of MIX11, with Microsoft showing demos of new apps from Skype, Spotify, Amazon and Layar among others that will make use of the new features in its next major update to the Windows Phone OS. The analyst perception of the smartphone market as (at least) a four-horse race is increasingly shared by the bigger internet services.The question is whether developers, media companies and brands are reaching that tipping point too. This week sawrumbles from games developersabout lower-than-expected revenues from Windows Phone 7, while many of the brands and publishers – if they're looking beyond iOS – can currently only see as far as Android.When I've talked to developers in recent months, they've tended to fall into two camps when it comes to Windows Phone. One camp talks about Windows Mobile, and are essentially refusing to invest in its successor until there are proven success stories of developers making hay on the platform. The other camp talks about Xbox – Microsoft's success with that platform despite widespread cynicism in its early days – and say they are increasingly keen to get onto WP7 early.Microsoft'srecently released stats on WP7 app usage– users download 12 apps a month on average – were part of its efforts to convert more developers into the latter camp.What do you think? As a developer, what do you think of Microsoft's efforts to establish Windows Phone as a long-term runner in the smartphone race, rather than an early faller? Post a comment and join the debate.
Spotifyis to cut back the amount of free listening available to users from 20 hours to 10.From 1 May, the music streaming service will reduce by half the amount of free music available each month to its 6 million users in the UK and Europe.Non-subscribers will only be allowed to listen to an individual track a maximum of five times. Users will move to the restricted model six months after they register – some existing users' listening time will remain free, for others the restricted plan starts on 1 May.Since its 2008 launch, Spotify's free offering has become popular, tempting more than1 million peopleto become paying customers."The service become incredibly popular. People are listening to more music and from a wider range of artists … and are giving up on piracy," Daniel Ek, Spotify's co-founder, announced in ablogposton the company's website on Thursday. "This is exactly what we hoped would happen."So it's vital that we continue offering an on-demand free service to you and millions more like you," he added. "But to make that possible we have to put some limits in place going forward."Ek said that the changes would mainly affect heavier users, and that people would still be able to listen to about 200 tracks, or 20 albums, free each month.The move will no doubt rankle with some music fans, who had grown used to Spotify's free streaming service being "too good to be true". The first commenter on Spotify's official blogpostlamented: "So long Spotify. It was nice knowing you. Guess I'll go back to pirating music again then."However, Ek told theFinancial Timeslast month: "We are trying to experiment with new ways to increase monetisation on free as well as paid. We are constantly trying to get people to pay but we prefer using carrots rather than sticks."The Anglo-Swedish company has been negotiating with the four major music labels – Universal, Warner Music, Sony and EMI – about its plans for a launch in the US. The music majors have long been wary of free music streaming services, like Spotify's non-premium offering.Spotify has always insisted that a sizeable base of free users would eventually translate into paying subscribers. Last month, the company announced its 1 millionth paying customer – paying subscribers make up 15% of Spotify's active users.The most recent audited annual accounts for Spotify, for 2009, show it lost £16.6m in the UK on revenues of £11.3m.
The PC market is showing signs of having passed its peak. Weak demand by consumers for PCs, coupled with a switch to tablets such as Apple's iPad, meant that worldwide PC shipments fell compared with the same period in 2010, according to two leading research groups.According to the research group Gartner, PC shipments were just 84.3m units in the first quarter of 2011 – a 1.1% year-on-year decline  (from 85.1m units) which was especially marked in the US, where it fell by 6.1%.Another research group, IDC, which uses slightly different methodologies,said that global shipments were 80.56m, a year-on-year fall of 3.2% from 83.2m in the first quarter of 2010, and down more than 10% in the US.That will have had a knock-on effect on Microsoft's quarterly results, due to be announced on 28 April. Calculations by the Guardian based on Microsoft's past seven years' financial results suggest that on that level of sales, Microsoft's Windows division will show profits of between $2.8bn and $3.0bn, depending on whether one uses Gartner's or IDC's estimate – results that will be slightly down or flat compared with last year's quarterly profit in that division of $3.06bn.Apple is due to announce its quarterly results on 20 April, which will include a figure for the number of iPads sold – which some analysts think could reach almost 15m for the quarter.Consumer anticipation of the launch of Apple's iPad 2 and other tablets, such as Motorola's Xoom and Samsung's range, meant that they held off buying PCs. "We're investigating whether this trend is likely to have a long-term effect on the PC market," said Mikako Kitagawa, Gartner's principal analyst.Both Gartner and IDC said that PC makers now face serious competition from the tablet market, but noted that other factors could be at play: "While it's tempting to blame the decline completely on the growth of media tablets, we believe other factors, including extended PC lifetimes and the lack of compelling new PC experiences, played equally significant roles," said Bob O'Donnell, program vice-president at IDC. He had only expected a small rise in sales – of 1.5% – but was surprised by the fall.Kitagawa said: "As with the worldwide market, the US PC market was affected by the hype surrounding media tablets. This was the third consecutive quarter of mobile PC shipment declines in the US." She noted that the US professional PC market showed steady growth across all sectors – but the consumer and public sector were much weaker.Gartner said that only businesses buying new machines had saved the market from a serious downturn: "Without the professional segment growth, the PC market could have experienced one of the worst declines in its recent history," said Kitagawa.Though both analysts expect the PC market to grow slightly this year, the slowdown in almost all areas could mean that PC sales will never see the strong growth of previous years.The top three PC makers – HP, Acer and Dell – all saw declines in shipments, which was most marked at Acer, down by 12.2% (Gartner) or 15.8% (IDC), while HP and Dell fell by 3.4% and 2.2% respectively (Gartner), or 2.8% and 1.8% (IDC). The biggest winners were Lenovo and Toshiba – best known for their laptop ranges – which saw increases of 16.6% and 5.3% respectively (Gartner) or 16.3% and 3.8% (IDC).Intel's recall of its Sandy Bridge systems is not reckoned to have had a significant impact on overall sales.The problems for the two largest companies differed: HP struggled in the Asia/Pacific region, while Dell saw weak consumer demand in the US. The fall was its first in six quarters, while in the same market Apple saw strong growth – up 18.9% – after refreshing its MacBook Pro line in February.North America and Europe are turning into the battleground for PCs against the influx of media tablets. PC sales in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) fell by 2.8%; the only areas that are still growing PC sales is Asia/Pacific and Latin America."Long-term success will depend on hardware manufacturers being able to articulate a message that is beyond simple hardware specifications," said Jay Chou, senior research analyst at IDC. "'Good-enough computing' has become a firm reality, exemplified first by mini-notebooks and now media tablets. Macroeconomic forces can explain some of the ebb and flow of the PC business, but the real question PC vendors have to think hard about is how to enable a compelling user experience that can justify spending on the added horsepower."

A source close to the negotiations characterizes the search giant as "disgusted" with the labels, so much so that they are seriously considering following Amazon's lead and launching their music could service without label licenses. I'm told that, though very remote and my guess is that it would never come to this, Google may go so far as to shut down the music service project altogether."Ironically, the fact that when Steve Jobs negotiated with the record companies in 2002 about licensing sales Apple was miniscule may have made his task far easier. If Apple were to go to the music business now and seek to license songs, it would probably have a tougher time.

Another mobile developer expert Mike Rowehl adds: 'We'll forget that we even passed through another era of native apps on the way to the mobile web.'"This is tantamount to saying that games companies will never want to write to device-specific code, or that developers will never want to use platform-specific interface tricks or APIs.

Maybe not; it's very hard for a young company to think beyond the product that made it successful.

Plans by communications minister Ed Vaizey to encourage rollout of superfast broadband using fibre-optic cables to rural homes and businesses are under threat from internet service providers and infrastructure providers angry at what they see as overcharging by BT.Fujitsu, which provides infrastructure support for a number of telecoms operators around the world, announced on Wednesday that it plans to build a fibre-optic network bringing superfast connections - which could run at 100 megabits per second (Mbps) or more - to 5m rural homes, working with Virgin Media, Talk Talk and the network company Cisco.But it admitted that the plan depends on getting government funding as well as a change in BT's charges for access to its existing network of telegraph poles and underground ducts - which just a week ago it condemned as being four or five times higher than an efficient market would produce.Fujitsu was one of five network operators and infrastructure providers who wrote to the communications minister Ed Vaizey at the start of April threatening to boycott the rural broadband projects he is proposing because they said that BT's proposed charges for access to its underground ducts and telegraph poles were "not cost-based".The complainants - Fujitsu, Virgin Media, TalkTalk, Geo and Vtesse - asserted that some of BT's prices for access and rental of physical infrastructure were four to five times more than an "efficient market" would charge.At the same time they also wrote to Ian Livingston, BT's chief executive, saying that its proposals on rural broadband would be "a commercial and policy failure" unless Openreach's prices were reduced.Fujitsu proposes putting its own cabling in a number of communities, using the ducts and poles presently controlled by the BT Openreach division to run the fibre-optic cable which would provide the high-speed connections.The proposal - which Fujitsu calls "a ground breaking and innovative alternative to BT Openreach" - is only feasible, the company says, if it can prevail on the government to provide it with some of the £530m funding, top-sliced from the BBC, for superfast broadband installation, and match those with new rulings by Ofcom that force down the cost of access to BT Openreach's infrastructure.BT's response to the complaints was that its proposed prices for duct and pole access compare very well with European averages, and that they are 15% lower than a basket of European prices.The problem with BT's proposed charges is that they significantly increase the cost of putting in cables. Fibre optic cable is itself now quite cheap - especially compared with copper, whose price has rocketed - but would-be providers of fibre-optic internet in rural areas face a double whammy: BT has agreements for locating its poles and ducts on many pieces of private land for very low rents (known as "wayleave") which no private company could now match; and fibre-optic cable laid by new businesses attracts extremely high business rates per kilometre, compared with BT which pays a fraction of the rate, determined by the Valuation Office Agency. ISPs and infrastructure providers have previously complained about this andsuggested that BT should be further broken up, to create a "BT Duct and Pole" division like Openreach.Complaints to Ofcom about the cost of duct and pole access, and to the VOA about the disparity in charging between BT and other fibre-optic providers, have so far produced no change. Vaizey has chaired meetings between ISPs, BT, Ofcom and the VOA but no results have been announced.In itsannouncement, Fujitsu says that its plans rely on Ofcom forcing BT Openreach - the division of the company which looks after its physical infrastructure - to provide access to its telegraph poles and underground cable ducts on "fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms".Superfast broadband delivered by fibre-optic cable has the potential to dramatically transform peoples' lives: studies in South Korea have shown that symmetrical broadband, where upload and download speeds are almost equal, lead to the creation of more content by everyone - compared to "asymmetrical" systems such as those found almost everywhere in the UK and US which rely on copper wire.
Anyone contemplating separation can, from today, use the same technology that brought them Cat Piano, Cow Toss and iBeer to decide whether or not to leave their partner.The £9.99 app – Divorce?A comprehensive guide to divorce in England and Wales – has been launched by a group of family lawyers who say that, with the focus on mediation as a first point of action, it is intended to provide a practical, down-to-earth view of the divorce process.Peter Martin, co-creator of the app, said it was intended to generate "informed discussions and better communication"Martin, head of family law at OGR Stock Denton, said: "The purpose of Divorce? is to make people really think through their decision. It allows couples to have their eyes open before embarking on the formal stages of the process and spending money on legal fees."People don't always think through the actual implications of divorce and this app makes them do that from the moment they start contemplating the idea. It might hopefully even encourage some people not to give up on their marriage so easily and try to work things out."The divorce rate in England and Wales is the lowest since 1974, according to the Office for National Statistics. In 2009, there were 113,949 divorces in England and Wales in 2009, 6.4% down on the previous year. It is the sixth consecutive year that the number of divorces has fallen, from a peak of 153,065 in 2003.Anastasia de Waal, deputy director and director of family and education at the thinktank Civitas, questioned whether "casual technology" would trivialise divorce or simply give people in an already distressing situation misleading information."One of the manufacturer's claims is that the app makes the divorce process easier to understand. If this holds true, and solely impenetrable legalese stands between you and spousal severance, some jargon-busting might be a good thing. But ultimately the chances are this app will be mainly used by the curious – and perhaps on occasion the temporally furious – with little threat to lawyers' coffers."Stephen Green of Christian Voice said: "This app disregards the sanctity of marriage by reducing it to mere monetary concerns. It could encourage divorce by normalising the decision, making it seem as easy to make as any other lifestyle choice. It could also deter the other partner from fighting to save their marriage, by making the process seem inevitable and, again, as normal as any other decision their partner might take that they have to accept."But Dr Adrian Rogers, a "pro-family" campaigner, said that if the app revealed the "true complications, difficulties and suffering" of divorce, it could help persuade people to fight to save their marriages. "For most people, divorce is soul-destroying. If this app conveys that to those considering separation and helps them realise that they can't do it like the celebrities can and walk away from their relationship and into another life with minimal fuss and bother, then this app should be welcomed."
A number of prominent UK technology news sites have seen their Google rankings drop substantially after the search engine rolled out its "Panda" update, intended to demote sites which scrape content from others, to the UK and other English-language Google users.The update also demotes one of the complainants to the European Commission, Microsoft-owned Ciao, which will almost vanish from many searches as a result of the downgrading.But some sites - including Google's own YouTube and the video site Vimeo, as well as other technology sites including Techcrunch and Mashable, and newspaper sites for the Mirror and The Independent - get a boost.Googlemade the change in the US at the end of February, and a number of original content sites were hit then, including the British Medical Journal. Now it has rolled it out more broadly.The effects of the downgrading were calculated byelevatelocal.co.ukSearchmetrics, which compared where the sites appeared in searches for particular keywords before and after the update. Search engine optimisation specialists constantly check which sites appear where on which keyword searches (such as "cheap flights" or "london hotels"), and can see the effects of large-scale changes to Google's algorithm almost immediately.For sites which rely on large amounts of Google traffic, vanishing from the first two pages of its search results - the point at which 99% of searchers give up - can mean the difference between financial life and death.Search Engine Watchsaysthat "all Google results are a zero-sum game", pointing to other sites which have benefited.Pocket Lint,Electric Pig,Tech Radar,TechEye, The Register's hardware siteRegHardware,PC Advisor,IT Pro Portaland the venerableComputer Weeklysites have all been hit by the reordering, which means that they fall down in Google's rankings on any given set of keywords - and so their traffic from search results falls dramatically.The update also risks arousing the ire of Microsoft - and the European Commission - because it demotes Ciao, the shopping comparison site owned by Microsoft which was one of thecomplainants to the EC that Google was using its monopoly unfairly, and which has sparked an EC investigation. Ciao's ranking has been cut by nearly 94%, meaning it will rarely figure in the first 10 results of a search.Many voucher and discount sites have also been hit by the wide-ranging changes. So have some so-called "content farms" such as Ehow and Mahalo.But there are winners too: sites where people spend a long time reading pages seem to have been rewarded, such as Ebay UK, Techcrunch, the National Lottery, Associated Newspapers' This is Money finance website, the Mirror Group Newspapers' mirror.co.uk, the tech news website Mashable.Soundcloud, the audio-sharing site that has become popular with amateur and professional musicians, also benefits from a hike in ranking.Google has also promoted its video-sharing site YouTube - but co-promoted the independent Vimeo video site, by almost the same amount.For Pocket Lint, the hardest hit of the UK technology news sites, asearch for its review of the HTC Sensationphone yields no results on the first two pages of Google (which is where 99% of searchers stop looking). On Microsoft's Bing, by contrast, it is thethird result.Stuart Miles, the founder of the eight-year-old site, said he was "puzzled" by Google's action, although he hoped the effects would not be too drastic: "about 60% of our traffic comes from Google - it would be a lot worse if it were 90%." But, he said, there was no clear reason why his site was targeted: "we put out all original content. I could understand it if we copied and pasted everyone else and were a massive aggregator of crap. But we don't and we aren't. As a small publisher, we're always trying our best to bring good stories to the table."Commenters at Search Engine Watch suggested that Pocket Lint may have been penalised for using redirection on affiliate links - which Google views negatively.Among the most visible sites that have been hardest hit are About.com and myvouchercodes.co.uk,says Holistic Search.The full list of losers and winners are in the tables below.

Rayman fans have been waiting an awfully long time for a new Rayman game. Aside from his frolics with the Rabbids and numerous handheld spin-offs, the last time Rayman starred in a title in the franchise's core series was in Rayman 3 back in 2003. In the meantime, Ubisoft has churned out numerous iterations of the series' second installment.Since its release in 1999, Rayman 2: The Great Escape has been renamed and re-released over a variety of platforms including the Game Boy Color, the PS2, the original DS, PSN, the iPhone and the iPad. Now it's shown up on the Nintendo 3DS as Rayman 3D.But it's worth pointing out that, however old it may be, Rayman 3D is still a very good platforming adventure. Set in a charmingly whimsical cartoon world, the game follows the adventures of the titular character as he tries to free a magical kingdom from a crew of one-eyed, gun-toting robot pirates, by collecting glowing lights called "lums".The controls are fairly smooth; the circle pad manoeuvres Rayman around the environments, the shoulder buttons switch the camera from third to first-person view and the face-buttons prompt Rayman to jump and hurl energy balls. The camera can be a bit problematic at times, but for the most part it doesn't actively ruin the experience.The best thing about the game is the way the beautiful environments complement the level design. The world of Rayman 3D is a lush, if slightly spooky Disney-esque place and platforming and exploring is broken up by puzzle solving and combat. There are also a lot of collectibles to gather and the lovely environments and cute characters that inhabit them make it a pleasure to go hunting for them.Rayman 3D is also the best-looking port of the game and the console's 3D visuals have added some nice touches here and there. The graphics have been given a good polish, and when the game's camera pulls back for a long shot, the 3D looks very impressive indeed.However, there are quite a few sections where the game looks like the player is handling a 3D character on a 2D background, and in some situations, the 3D can be a hindrance. This usually occurs when the player has to switch to the first-person view to work out the dynamics of their environment. In such instances, players can find their view completely obscured by objects jutting into the shot or the camera slamming into a wall. When this happens, I recommend turning the 3D effects off.If you like platform adventures and you've never played any of the many iterations of this game before, you'll most likely find it a charming, if slightly dated, experience. If, on the other hand, you remember playing Rayman 3D back when it was called Rayman 2: The Great Escape, then you'll have seen everything this game has to offer already, just not in 3D.You also may be somewhat irked that one of the launch titles for the brand new Nintendo console you just spent about £200 on is a port of a game which was released more than a decade ago.• Game reviewed on Nintendo 3DS

A decade ago, American McGee's Alice was a landmark action adventure game – literary in tone, surreal in design and boasting a female character who, for once, didn't appear to have been designed by the cast of American Pie.Using Lewis Carroll's books as a jumping off point, ex-Id Software designer McGee had Alice locked in an insane asylum, driven mad by the loss of her family in a terrible house fire. Trapped in this gothic hellhole, Alice's escape to Wonderland becomes a metaphor for mental breakdown; a dark, fractured place where familiar characters were transformed into monstrous apparitions.Now, finally, the long-awaited sequel is approaching. Set 10 years after the original, Alice is out of the madhouse, but she's still suffering hallucinations, and together with her psychiatrist, she must save her sanity by discovering the true cause of her family's demise. The answers, of course, are down that rabbit hole…At EA's showcase event in London in early April, the publisher was showing two areas – The Hatters and Queensland – set in and around vast crumbling buildings. Once again there's a seamless integration of gothic, surreal and steam punk elements, and on current hardware it all looks stunning. There's an absolutely beautiful sequence, set at twilight, which has these huge steam-powered airships floating in an ochre sky – leading to them are giant clock cogs that form precarious platforms.In the level I play, Alice must leap between decrepit platforms within a ruined mansion, using a double jump that lets her sail over long distances, accompanied by streams of animated butterflies. Everywhere there are giant plants waiting to suck her in, and dotted about the place are teeth to collect (reflecting the fact that many people have bad dreams about all their teeth falling out), which power up her weapons.Alice has a bizarre armoury to call upon. Hitting X lets her slash with the familiar vorpal blade, while B drops a clockwork bomb that saunters around before exploding. The Y button brings up the more unwieldy but damaging hobbyhorse attack – allowing Alice to clobber enemies with the popular Victorian plaything. In the level we saw, she also had access to two ranged weapons, a pepper pot that operated like a pistol firing peppery bullets, and a teapot grenade launcher. Call of Duty it ain't.Enemies, once again, take themes and images from the books, but twist and distort them. The playing card guards are back looking even more malevolent – some are armoured so can't be attacked from the front; Alice has to trick her way around and then swipe at them from behind. There's a handy dodge mechanic on the right shoulder tab, which sends Alice hurtling away from foes; combine it with jump and she can get out of any tight spot, transforming momentarily into a swarm of butterflies – it's a lovely concept, beautifully reflecting the game's interconnection of escapist fantasy worlds and twisted nightmares.Building on this theme, we encounter one boss character, a hulking giant whose body is covered in the heads and limbs of delicate porcelain dolls – these must be smashed to defeat him. Apparently, the black substance that covers him is beginning to infect the whole of Wonderland, and a key element of the game is restoring the landscape to its previous splendour.This sequence ends with Alice being chased through a maze by a giant warrior with a spinning blade staff. Finally, she gets to an open area where she finds a cake with a sign sticking out of it saying – yes – "eat me". She does, and then grows to an enormous height, towering over the warrior, who promptly drops his blade and stands cowering. She lifts her foot and stamps on him, splattering blood everywhere.Elsewhere, there are puzzles to solve, exploration tasks to figure out (a "shrink" power on the left tab gives you access to lower areas, for example) and memories to discover. There's a real sense of detail and art about the environments, from the chequerboard platforms, to the curling, sprawling vegetation, to the hideous enemies. At one point Alice fights a giant teapot with a giant red eye that she can eventually burst sending goo spurting out.It's stuff that will really resonate with fans of Carroll's part-whimsical, part-sinister books, as well as veterans of the original game. And of course, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Caterpillar and the Red Queen all crop up in variously corrupted forms.True, Alice: Madness Returns appears to exhibit all the mechanics and structural conventions of a conventional third-person action puzzler, but it's also filled with interesting visual ideas and maintains its predecessor's sense of menace and melancholy. It looks, in short, to be everything Tim Burton's movie should have been but resolutely wasn't – an unsettling modern interpretation of Lewis Carroll's genius.•Alice: Madness Returnsis out on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 in June, published by Electronic Arts
Let's just pretend, for the sake of argument, that yesterday never happened...
Age:29.Appearance:Identical. Miffed.Miffed?Yes, probably.Why?Because Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have lost their final appeal against Facebook, whose founder Mark Zuckerberg they claim stole their idea back in the dim and distant past . . .Or, 2004?Yes, thereabouts . . . and went on to make a fortune from it.But I thought they reached a settlement with Zuckerberg almost as handsome as themselves last year.Well, if you can call $65m in cash and stocks split two ways handsome.I can and I do. What were their grounds for appeal?That Facebook did not provide accurate information about the value of the company and the value of the shares they were getting.How much were they asking for?No figure has been published, but it is thought to be in the squillions.And even half a squillion is a super-handsome amount. But the judges rejected the notion?Yes. They pointed out that the twins had access to a vast battalion of blue-chip lawyers, including their father, who is an expert in valuation, and that this couldn't therefore be characterised as a David and Goliath case where the little guy got screwed.The boys are 6ft 5in, I believe.Your literalism is stunning but in this case essentially harmless. Yes, yes they are.So what happens now?Their attorney says he respectfully disagrees with the ninth circuit's findings and plans to file a petition for a rehearing with a larger panel of judges in the near future.Indefatigable, aren't they? What are their chances of success?Minimal. The courts are usually very unwilling to re-open cases where parties of equivalent bargaining strength agreed on a formal compensation package. Eric Goldman, professor of internet law, says the legal question doesn't warrant review and adds: "I think they would be a lot happier and wealthier if they took that money and invested it in their therapist."At last, some sound legal advice.LOL!Do say:"OMG! I canot believe wat those judjes have said to u, man! Good luck wid da nxt round!"Don't say:"Actually, I prefer Friends Reunited."
The networking and router company Cisco is shutting down the consumer-oriented Flip camera business that it bought for $590m in 2009. The move will mean the loss of 550 jobs worldwide, cost Cisco $300m – and disappoint thousands of users who had enjoyed the devices' simplicity.The shutdown,announced on Tuesday afternoonas part of a widespread reorganisation as the company attempts to rejig its business, will see Cisco reorganise its remaining consumer businesses to support its existing "key priorities" – notably the routers and switches that generate the majority of its sales.Though Cisco never broke out revenues from the Flip division, they are believed to be small: itslatest accountsshow that "other products" – understood to include its Linksys routers and Flip cameras – generated revenues of just $211m in the most recent quarter, down from $229m the previous quarter. Profits or losses for the division were not disclosed.A spokeswoman for Cisco would not say whether the company had tried to sell the Flip business, but the fact of the closure suggests it was impossible to find a trade buyer.That in turn suggests that the stand-alone movie camera business is effectively dead, killed off by smartphones capable of shooting high-definition video which have seen explosive sales in the past 18 months – precisely the period since Cisco bought Flip.The Flip camera, made originally by Pure Digital Technologies, burst to prominence in September 2007, before the widespread penetration of smartphones. Only 80m smartphones were sold in 2007 – but that rose to 304m out of the 1.6bn phones sold in 2010. By contrast, Flip had sold 2m of its cameras by January 2009. Yet it was one of the most popular stand-alone camcorders on sale through Amazon, and in 2008 it was estimated to have a 17% share of the $2.4bn camcorder market – behind only Sony, with 21%. But Sony held on to its lead and seems to have extended it in 2010 as the low-end market was eaten by mobile phones with video capability.Flip's devices were hampered because while they were the same size as a smartphone, they could not offer a number of features that smartphones or high-end "feature phones" could, such as uploads to online sites; but they didn't offer other features either such as Wi-Fi connectivity – though this was often hinted at by executives – or microphone sockets, which could have made them useful for some professionals. At the same time high-end professional cameras have begun to offer high-definition filming, leaving the Flip models without a viable market.Cisco is embarking on a widespread review of its businesses. A week ago, Cisco chief executive John Chambers sent employees a memo vowing to take "bold steps" to narrow the company's focus after several quarters of disappointing results – though the company is far from loss-making: in its last financial year, to the end of August 2010, it saw revenues rise 11% to $40bn and profits up 26% to $7.8bn.The 550 job losses will have little impact on the total headcount within the 73,000-strong company, and a spokeswoman said it would try to find them jobs within Cisco.Cisco's spokeswoman would not guarantee that the Linksys router business was guaranteed to survive the review, but said that it offered a "market-leading product" and that it demonstrated a good fit with Cisco's core businesses.• Ray Sangster, Flip's chief executive for Europe, Middle East and Africa,spoke to the Guardian's Tech Weekly podcast in July 2009, insisted that the acquisition would bring "synergies" between Linksys, Cisco and Flip but that he couldn't discuss them at the time because "they haven't been finalised".
Join Aleks Krotoski, Jemima Kiss and Charles Arthur on the Tech Weekly studio as they discuss this week's hot news stories. On the slate is Facebook's unexpected new allegiance with Chinese search giant Baidu; the pair have announced they will be launching a new social network for the Chinese market. Will Facebook hit the same stumbling blocks Google did, or is this partnership their attempt to meet the demands of the government? And what kind of access will the government have to the new social network's system?Also in this week's news, what effect will the natural disasters in Japan have on the manufacturing ecosystem, and delivery dates, of the region's phones, tablets and other hardware? We speak with Christina Milanesi from Gartner Research. Finally, Google has purchased ITA, the database used by travel agents to book flights and hotels. What do the stipulations outlined by the US justice department for the purchase indicate about the details of the anti-trust investigation that Google is currently embroiled in?And to round off the South by Southwest Interactive coverage, Jemima speaks with the couple behind Lanyrd, the social conference tool taking the geek world by storm.Don't forget to ...• Comment below• Mail us attech@guardian.co.uk• Get ourTwitter feedfor programme updates or follow ourTwitter list• Like ourFacebook page• See ourpics on Flickr/Postyour tech pics
Mark Zuckerberg might have to create a "Don't like" button for people claiming they own all or a fraction of Facebook. Having alreadyseen off the Winklevoss twins who claimed he stole the idea for Facebook from them, Zuckerberg now faces a convicted fraudster who says he has a contract giving him 84% of the social network.Paul Ceglia, from Wellsville, New York, said Zuckerberg signed a contract with him that shows he should be entitled to the lion's share of the business – and late on Monday night released, through his lawyers in the US, a tranche of emails that purport to show him and the Facebook chief executive discussing, between July 2003 and July 2004, various matters relating to "thefacebook" – as the site was known in its early days.The case will be heard in federal court, following a ruling at the end of March that Ceglia and Zuckerberg live in different states – though the latter grew up in New York before going to Harvard, and then to California where he turned the company into the world-spanning social network, with about 600 million members.Ceglia claims that in 2003 he hired Zuckerberg, then an 18-year-old first-year undergraduate at Harvard, to do some coding for a site called Streetfax (later Streetdelivery) that he was planning. Zuckerberg was paid $1,000 on a "work for hire" contract, Ceglia has contended in court, and then put to work on a project called "The Face Book" or "The Page Book" in which Ceglia invested $1,000.Certainly, when Facebook first launched, it was called "thefacebook" – but the other details are disputed by Facebook and Zuckerberg's lawyers.Among the emails released by Ceglia through his lawyers, DLA Piper, is one in which Zuckerberg apparently tells Ceglia he is thinking of shutting the site down because it is having so little success, despite the payment made by Ceglia to keep it going.In response Facebook has said the emails, and the contract on which Ceglia claims to have Zuckerberg's signature, are fakes – and point to Ceglia's convictions on counts of fraud and past arrests.Ceglia was arrested and charged with criminal fraud and grand larceny in 2009, after the wood pellet company he and his wife run failed to deliver $200,000 worth of orders to customers in four states. A lawyer for the Ceglias then said the money had been invested in machinery, labour and subcontractors for the pellets.Ironically, Ceglia has also said that fraud charge was the reason he discovered his claim to Facebook – that it was only when looking through papers relating to those cases that he discovered the old contract with Zuckerberg.Ceglia first filed suit last summer, and has now added extra evidence in the form of the emails. DLA Piper has said it performed "weeks" of due diligence on Ceglia's claims to show that they stood up – including an "electronic analysis" of the contract where Ceglia signed up Zuckerberg.But the case is even more complicated. Andrew Logan, founder and chief executive of a company called StreetDelivery, claims that in 2003 Ceglia was working for him at the time he claims to have hired Zuckerberg to code Streetfax.That could mean that Ceglia's hiring of Zuckerberg – and any intellectual property created there – actually reverts to Logan. For Ceglia, even if he wins he might lose.For Zuckerberg, though, it's just another day proving that while failure is an orphan, success definitely has many, many parents.
First it wasracing pigeons; now another iconic piece of English life will provide the backdrop for an experiment to demonstrate the need for faster rural broadband – cricket.In what's being described as the 'world's first' live broadcast of a village cricket match, a group of people with an interest in improving rural broadband have organised themselves using Twitter to film the Easter weekend match.Organiser John Popham told me Wray had been chosen because the village has30 megabits per second (Mbps) symmetrical community networkwhich was installed by Lancaster University - meaning that it achieves both downloadandupload speeds about eight times faster than the typical UK household's broadband download speed (and about 60 times faster than the typical upload speed of 0.5Mbps).Over to Popham:"Has it been done before? So far, no one has challenged my assertion that it's a first, and, if someone has done something like it, I am sure no one has done a whole match in the way I am intending to do it."As far as the technology. I probably can't say until I've done a proper test, but I will probably use livestream because that allows for multiple cameras and switching between them. I'll probably use at least two, and ideally three, laptops with USB HD webcams placed in different positions and use livestream to switch between cameras. This will be dependent on being able to get power to three different locations. I am assured it can be done."I'm confident we can do this, because the village Wi-Fi has a 30Mbps upload speed. Even though you switch the output between cameras, it does mean that all the cameras you use are actually streaming constantly to the network."The ideas has snowballed since it was first tweeted and this morning was even picked up by the prolific celeb tweeterStephen Fry.But the point isn't (just) to let you watch cricket,explainsPopham:It's a bit of fun, but it has a serious purpose too. The serious side is to demonstrate that it can be done, it IS possible to live broadcast events like this using relatively cheap equipment and a good internet connection. It will also demonstrate the importance of good internet connectivity in rural areas, and the need for fast UPLOAD connections if we are to realise the aspiration to use the internet to enable more people to produce their own content.Given fast broadband in communities, you can see the potential: "televising" (online) of your local cricket match, parish council meeting, whatever. The key difference about the Wray system is its fast upload as well as download speed - meaning it's known as SDSL (Symmetrical Digital Subscriber Link) rather than the ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Link) that almost everyone at home has. The only way to get good SDSL though is to have optic fibre connections to homes and villages - which is a challenge that BT and other operators have fought shy of because of the cost. Maybe Wray will show the promise and get things moving.Follow the progress of the project at Popham's blog:http://johnpopham.wordpress.com.
There's something of an explosion in music apps happening on iPhone and Android at the moment, from official artist apps that look to go beyond pure news and audio samples, through to social location services aimed at gig-goers.Here's a list of 30 apps that have launched in the past few months, from big stars and startup developers alike. It offers a glimpse at the trends and technologies that make apps as potentially habit-changing for music fans as they are for gamers and TV viewers.Note, this list is focused on apps that involve listening to or interacting around music, rather than actually creating it. Not because the latter isn't just as interesting – there is a similar boom ininnovative music-making apps– but because, well, those apps will sit better in their own list.Meanwhile, the focus on recently launched apps is why the likes of Spotify, Pandora Radio, Last.fm and others are not included. They're still innovative and important, but this piece is about new contenders in 2011.The History of JazzThe History of Jazz appThis sits alongside The Elements as one of the iPad apps showing that tablet book-apps can be far more than a scanned-in PDF with a bit of extra video.The History of Jazzoffers an interactive timeline tracing the chronological history of jazz, with music samples, videos and curated playlists to dive into featured artists' catalogues.DiscovrThis is less of a timeline, and more of a flowchart plotting connections between artists whose music is broadly similar.Discovrgets you to type in an artist, then tap your way through the chart of related bands, double-tapping to bring up biographies, videos and blogposts.MusicDrop and BoxyTunesTwo apps that both have the same aim – to turn online storage service DropBox into a fully functioning cloud music service. BothMusicDropandBoxyTunesstream music from your DropBox account, pulling in cover artwork and other information. They will increasingly face competition from pure cloud music services in 2011, but for existing DropBox users they may be a good stopgap.Decoded by Jay-ZDecoded by Jay-Z appThisuniversal app for iPhone and iPadis based on a physical book collecting together rapper Jay-Z's lyrics, and adding in video interviews. People paying $4.99 for the app can choose 10 of the 36 featured songs to unlock, or pay another $9.99 to unlock all 36. The actual music is not included – the app focuses on lyrics – but if the songs are already on the user's device, they can be played in sync with the words.BEP360will.i.am likes apps so much, he started his own development studio to make them.BEP360was the first app to emerge. It's described as a '360 mobile music video', which gets fans to hold up their iPhone and spin around for a 360-degree view of the video for the Peas' The Time (Dirty Bit) single. Augmented reality features and photo-sharing are also included, making this an app worth admiring even if you're not so keen on the music itself.Mike ScannerPart of the promotional effort around the final album by the Streets,Mike Scanneris one of the first artist apps to use the kind of barcode-scanning technology that's been seen in numerous mobile shopping apps. The idea here: fans scan household items to unlock exclusive music, videos and ticket offers.Erykah BaduAs wereported in February, soul singer Badu is the first artist to use the platform of startup FanTrail to try to connect with her fans – although she's since been followed by the Roots and Quiet Company. TheErykah Baduapp brings gamification to music fandom, with users filling up their 'LoveMeter' by sharing news with friends, buying music and checking in at gigs. The more full the meter gets, the more personal the recorded voice messages from Badu accessed through the app will be.Lykke LiLykke Li appScandinavian pop artistLykke Li's appuses another platform, from Steam Republic. Here, the innovation is less about gamified rewards, and more about linking the app with her existing website, so fans can create profiles and share content across both. That includes blogposts and photos, while the app also has the now-obligatory gig check-ins feature too.Pocket HipsterWecovered this appin February too: it's a collaboration between two music technology startups, The Echo Nest and We Are Hunted.Pocket Hipsterincludes two avatar hipsters, who sneer at your music collection and suggest alternatives to listen to. The hipster aspect is for fun, but the recommendation technology is very serious – it uses The Echo Nest's API, which is being licensed to a range of app and service companies in 2011.we7 Radio PlusPersonalised radio is all the rage in the US thanks to Pandora Radio, but licensing arguments led to the company pulling out of the UK a few years ago. That's left the way clear for Last.fm, and now we7 to see how the concept flies among British music fans. Released for Android this year,we7 Radio Pluscreates radio stations on the fly based on specific artists and genres.SoundTrackingSoundTracking appReleased by developer Schematic Labs in time for SXSW this year,SoundTrackinglets people share details of the song they're listening to there and then, including photos and comments. Other users of the app will be able to listen to 30-second samples courtesy of iTunes, and it integrates with Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare.Roxette SingboxWho knew Roxette would be the subject of an innovative music game in 2011? That said, who knew the Smurfs would be the subject of one of the most lucrative iPhone social games in 2010...Roxette Singboxbrings the SingStar karaoke game model to iOS, using in-app purchases to download individual songs, with email and Facebook challenges for a social spin.Spin PlayUS music magazine Spinlaunched an iPad appin March this year, but it went beyond simply reproducing the print edition's articles. Each $1.99 issue includes a playlist of 60 streaming songs and 30 streaming videos, chosen by the Spin team to complement the editorial content for that issue. The aim is for readers to listen to bands while reading about them.Play by AOL MusicPlay by AOL Music appLaunched for Android smartphones in March,Play by AOL Musicis another music discovery app, released by the newly-editorial focused US internet giant. It's a music player app with social features baked in, enabling people to easily tweet or Facebook share the song that's currently playing. Friends' posts and comments are pulled into a real-time feed.Tune Drop and Pioneer Air JamEveryone's a wannabe DJ at house parties nowadays, but usually whoever controls the device gets to choose the tunes. Apps are emerging to make the process more collaborative, though.Tune Dropis an iPad app that lets party guests cue up requests from your iPod music library, whilePioneer Air Jamhandles the process wirelessly – albeit only for Pioneer hi-fis.Kling Klang MachineTechno pioneers Kraftwerk were similarly innovative with their first iOS application this year, billingKling Klang Machineas an 'interactive 24-hour music generator'. Fans can browse a music map of the world divided into timezones, and mix Kraftwerk loops and samples together – overseen by wireframe models of the group itself.DJ RivalsDJ Rivals appUS startup Booyah has had success with its Nightclub City Facebook game and MyTown iPhone social location game.DJ Rivalsbrings the two ideas together, as players build up their virtual DJ through rhythm mini-games and location-based DJ battles.RoqbotRoqbotwon this year's SXSW Music Accelerator contest, and is another collaborative playlist app, except this time designed to be used in bars and restaurants rather than the home. The iPhone and Android app lets users vote for the songs they'd like to hear, making it an app-centric incarnation of the traditional jukebox.Nirvana Classic Album: NevermindIn itself,this appisn't technically innovative: it's basically an existing documentary film ported to iPad, with bonus material and social commenting. However, it's a sign that labels – Universal Music Group in this case – are keen to see how much demand there is for tablet apps focused on their back catalogues, as well as newer bands.McFly Live – Above The NoisePunk-pop band McFly teamed up with UK firm LoveLive recently, to release anapp for a specific gig, rather than the band as a whole. It let fans watch a live stream of their concert at Wembley Arena in early April, while entering a contest and chatting to other fans on a forum.Swedish House Mafia – Until One iPad EditionSwedish House Mafia appScandinavian dance supergroup Swedish House Mafia are already exploring multiplatform content, having released their own book and video documentary around latest album Until One. Now there'san iPad apptoo, based on the book and videos, but with all nine tracks of the album streamable from within the app. Impressive technically, but also for the ability of label EMI to get the necessary publishing licensing signed off to include the full tracks.Owl City GalaxyWhile fans await new material from Owl City, they can dive into his US-onlyGalaxy application, which offers similar gamification to the Erykah Badu app - points for 'future Owl City bonuses'. Social is the key feature, with fans invited to 'customise your own planet and connect with other fans', with an exclusive track dangled as the reward for doing so.Eavesdrop, MyStream and PairShareMyStream appThese three apps all launched around the same time, aiming to provide a modern-day equivalent of the two headphone sockets found on vintage Walkmans. All three allow people to listen to music at the same time, using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth streaming in the case ofEavesdropandMyStream, and just Bluetooth forPairShare.AudioVroomOriginally developed as part of a Music Hack Day event,AudioVroomstyles itself as a 'multi-user internet radio station', where people earn points for recommending the app to friends, which can then be spent on listening to ad-free personal radio stations. Foursquare-style badges are thrown into the mix, while the sharing happens using the Bump app's API, requiring people to physically knock their iPhones together to connect. US-only for now.The National MallThis 'hyperlocal' app isn't much use to fans who don't live in Washington DC, where US duo BlueBrain reside.The National Mallis an interactive album designed to be listened to on a walk around the National Mall in DC, with the rhythms and beats changing as they go. The app is due out imminently.iheartradio for iPadUS radio group Clear Channel's iheartradio apps have racked up millions of downloads on iPhone and other smartphones, but thenewly-released iPad appshows what can be added for larger screens. Listeners can see related tweets when listening to one of the 750 US radio stations streaming within the app, while also perusing videos and photo galleries.That's our selection, so what do you think? Which of these apps has most potential, and which will sink without a trace? And have we missed anything out that's been released in 2011? Post a comment to let us know your feedback.
A quick burst of 12 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamGartner's iPhone, Android predictions radically revised in a year and a half &gt;&gt; Apple Insider"Just a year and a half ago, t[Gartner] made similar bold predictions about the smartphone industry that suggested the same dramatic turn around for Microsoft. In fact, the only real similarity between the company's 2009 predictions and its 2011 predictions is the idea that Microsoft would be selling about 68m phones by 2012, and taking around 12% of the smartphone industry.Every other predicted element in Garner's outlook has changed significantly in the last year and a half. Nokia's Symbian, once seen as holding on to the lion's share of smartphones in 2012 (with more market share than it managed to retain last year) is now expected to dry up and blow away, given Nokia's plans to drop support for it and focus on WP7 later this year. "350,000 Google Android devices being activated daily; 16% increase from a few months ago signifies rapid acceleration in mobile advertising opportunities says executive director at UBS investment bank &gt;&gt; Yahoo! Finance"We have seen Google is now activating 350,000 Android devices daily. That's up from 300,000 several months ago and roughly 60,000 a year ago, so a significant acceleration in mobile. We are seeing Google also serve over two billion ad impressions a day through AdMob, which serves display advertising into applications on mobile devices. We are seeing Google post over $1 billion in revenue from mobile alone, over $2.5 billion in display, so we think display advertising is also at a big inflection point as companies like Procter And Gamble (PG) and other consumer products companies are opening up their budgets and spending more online. Twelve years ago that money may have gone to Yahoo! or AOL."Olive Garden food photo tagged you on Facebook? It's a viral scam &gt;&gt; Naked SecurityWe make that two new scams circulating on Facebook that day.Is Amazon Stealing Android from Google? &gt;&gt; Tim Bajarin"I have been watching Amazon's recent moves involving Android with great fascination. Two weeks ago, it launched the Amazon Appstore that focuses on Android apps, and last week it announced a cloud-based music service with a special version just for Android. Although Google has its own Android Marketplace, Amazon is bringing a more structured store to Android with room for users comments and reviews--a key step to vetting the apps it carries."This is a very strategic move by Amazon, and it could actually bring some sanity and consistency to the Android development community and all Android users. At the moment, Google's approach to creating Android is scattered. There are so many versions of this OS floating around that the OEMs who license Android are increasingly frustrated with Google's lack of discipline in laying out a consistent roadmap for Android that they can follow."Browsers market share visualised &gt;&gt; Behance NetworkA slightly better visualisation than Monday's, we think.Why "post PC" doesn't mean "sans PC" &gt;&gt; Michael GartenbergMichael Gartenberg, who has seen tons of consumer gadgets come and go: "So, why so much hype about the post-PC world? Because historically, as PCs have become increasingly sophisticated, they've also become increasingly complex. Users become empowered by new features while simultaneously being forced to contend with complex systems.."This is one reason why devices like the iPad have become popular. No, they can't do everything a PC can do today--but that's not a bad thing. The iPad performs some tasks quite well, all while keeping those tasks simple--and that means an iPad can replace that second or third PC someone was thinking of buying.As we transition into a post-PC world, the ability of devices to balance new technology and features against complexity for a given set of functions will help drive purchases. The key will be for users to figure out just what device best matches the appropriate skill set or need. Need to decode the human genome? There's no app for that just yet."Apple files patent for hybrid e-ink and LCD screen &gt;&gt; Macworld UK"The display would be smart enough to evaluate the content you're viewing and automatically switch between e-ink for reading and a full colour display for video and other content.

Josh HallidaySales of tablet computers such as Apple's iPad will more than quadruple from 15m worldwide in 2010 to 70m in 2011 and eat into the slowing PC market over the next four years, according to Gartner.The iPad will dominate the nascent tablet market for the foreseeable future, the research firm forecasts, selling about 48m this year, a near-fourfold increase on 2010, to control about 69% of the market in 2011. But rivals continue to chip away at its position. Over the next four years the iPad's share is expected to fall to 47%, in a market selling 294m annually, as tablets running Google's Android operating system, HP's WebOS and RIM's PlayBook join the competition.Notably, Microsoft's Windows is not expected to make any significant impact on the field even by 2015.The boom in demand for tablet computers comes during a slowdown of PC sales growth, as consumers opt for tablets and smartphones instead of notebooks and laptops. "I think a lot of the tablet sales will be additive, not just subtracting from PC sales," said Carolina Milanesi, the analyst who led Gartner's latest forecast. "But we do see some displacement on the mobile PC side, definitely for mini-notebooks and low-end laptops. It will probably lengthen the replacement cycle for the PCs that are out there."PC manufacturer Acer has already indicated that it thinks the era of the mini-notebook is over, ejecting its chief executive at the end of March and saying that those devicesmay see only single-digit sales growth, compared with tablets, which it sees as requiring an "aggressive plan" to gain share.Analysts haverepeatedly downgradedtheir expectations for the number of PCs to be sold in the face of slowing demand. In early March Gartner lowered its 2011 forecast to 387.8m, a 10.5% increase on 2010, from the 406.6m (representing 15.9% growth) it had suggested at the end of December. The company also cut its forecast for 2012, predicting that 440.6m PCs would be sold – a 13.6% jump on 2011 – rather than the 14.8% growth it had expected.However, the rise of the tablet does not mean the death of the PC,according to Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg. "Even as some today hype the death of the PC, let's be clear: the PC isn't going anywhere any time soon," he said.Gartenberg describes the traditional PC as the "ultimate Swiss army knife of information", which the iPad is not there to displace. "The iPad performs some tasks quite well, all the while keeping those tasks simple – and that means an iPad can replace that second or third PC someone was thinking of buying."Gartner expects 108m tablet computers to be sold in 2012, almost double this year's prediction, as more tablets running Google's Android operating system are brought to market, to hit about 14m sold this year.Motorola's Xoom tablet, seen as the first realistic competitor to the iPad because it uses the latest Android 3.0 ("Honeycomb") operating system, does not yet have an official UK release date. According to an analyst note from Deutsche Bank last week the Xoom has sold more than 100,000 units since it went on sale on 24 February in the US.
Privacy groups have attacked the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) after it decided not to prosecute BT and Phorm for secretly tracking the online habits of 18,000 internet users.BT and Phorm sparked a privacy backlash in 2006 and 2007 when itemergedthat the companies were covertly trialling software that tracked peoples' internet behaviour in order to deliver targeted advertising. BT, the UK's largest broadband provider,ditchedthe controversial system in 2009.The CPSruled on Fridaythat there was insufficient evidence to prosecute BT and Phorm under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), which makes it an offence to intercept internet traffic without either the user's explicit consent or a judicial warrant.Simon Davies, director of the campaign group Privacy International, said his organisation would appeal for a judicial review of the CPS ruling but feared that it would "fall flat on its face" into a "legal black hole"."Going to appeal against BT or Phorm – or even Google – in the UK is simply going to fall flat on its face," Davies told the Guardian. "There's a real risk that big corporations are escaping scot-free whenever they violate the rights of people in the UK. There doesn't appear to be any legal infrastructure to tackle these companies."Davies said he felt that budget cuts were forcing law enforcement agencies to be more selective with investigations. "It's fundamentally a problem with the budget freeze," he said. "The police can't find any legal powers or aren't prepared to because of the cost – so our complaints fall into a legal blackhole. That's got to be dealt with."The CPS on Friday said that a prosecution against BT and Phorm "would not be in the public interest". It said that any offending was "the result of an honest mistake or genuine misunderstanding of the law" and that there was no evidence that anyone "suffered any loss or harm" as a result of the trial.Jim Killock, the executive director of the internet advocacy organisation Open Rights Group, accused the government of "perpetuating a muddle" over which body investigates potential internet privacy breaches. "The CPS isn't equipped to make legal judgments in this area, which involves complex industrial regulation," he said. "It requires proper regulation with a proper regulator."Daniel Hamilton, the campaign director at privacy pressure group Big Brother Watch, said he was "not at all surprised" by the ruling. He added: "Whether it's a CPS investigation or an information commissioner investigation, [these bodies have] consistently shown themselves to be unwilling to take action."BT said it was pleased that the CPS had decided not to prosecute. Phorm had not returned a request for comment at time of publication.BT stopped using Phorm tracking technology in 2009, after a second, public, series of trials. The setback accelerated a downward spiral for the AIM-listed technology firm, which once promised to boost the value of advertising for most of the UK's leading internet service providers, including Virgin Media and TalkTalk.Phorm left the UK market towards the end of 2009, as popular websites like Amazon and the once-dominant MySpace publicly expressed their concern over its behavioural advertising technology. The US-based firm last year announced an attempt towoo Brazil and China.Phorm recorded a pre-tax loss of $29.35m (£17.95m) in 2009, the last full year for which information is available, with no recorded turnover. Even during the US-based firm's heyday, in 2006, Phorm reported a pre-tax loss of $11.54m, on revenues of $1.27m.
Smartphone sales could drop by as much as 5% this year because the Japanese earthquake in March seriously affected supplies of key parts for a number of suppliers, say industry sources.Among those affected in the £100bn industry are the world leader Nokia, BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion (RIM) and Sony Ericsson.But other key players – including iPhone maker Apple, as well as Samsung, HTC and China's Huawei – are understood to have moved quickly immediately after the quake hit to secure supplies from alternative locations in China, Taiwan and Korea, which could give them a substantial advantage as shortages hit rivals over the next three months.A key element is a chemical for lithium-ion batteries, used in mobile phones, tablets and laptops, for which 70% of the production comes from a Japanese factory shut by the quake.The phone companies will come under the microscope when they announce first-quarter results, with Apple, Sony Ericsson and Nokia due to announce their figures between 19 and 21 April.The latter two have already said that their supply chains of components could be hit by the after effects of the quake and tsunami, which shut down a number of factories in Japan that produced phone cameras, lenses and battery components, while RIM in its earnings announcement earlier in April guided profits lower and said delivery times for some components were "uncertain".That could have serious implications as the company prepares to launch its PlayBook rival to Apple's iPad tablet on 19 April in the US, as well as a number of other handsets later this year.The long-term effects of the quake may only become apparent towards the end of May, when it will become clear whether factories in Japan have been able to restart production successfully. "There is widespread uncertainty about the Japanese situation … we believe the shortages will start to bite in the third quarter, when we'll get a clearer picture of who is most affected," said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight.Phone vendors usually carry four to five weeks' supply of components, and have an additional six or seven weeks' inventory of finished phones in the sales channel, said Carolina Milanesi, smartphone analyst for the research company Gartner. "If things go back to normal quickly then the third quarter [of the year] will probably see sales down 3% to 5%, and then the fourth quarter come back strongly," she said. "But if the problems continue and in the third quarter they can't restock, then sales there could be down 5% to 7%, and the year as a whole could be down overall 5%."A critical bottleneck could be the supply of a heat-resistant chemical called polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) – used as an adhesive in the lithium ion batteries used in both mobile phones and portable computers. Kureha Corp, which makes about 70% of the world's supply, halted production at its factory in Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, following the disaster. The company has been relying on inventories and hopes to restart production at the end of April, but a spokesman said it was likely that clients had been affected.On average, analysts expect global  mobile phone sales volumes to have grown 10.8% in the first quarter of 2011, according to 18 analysts polled by Reuters. The market recovered from a slump in 2009 to see a total of 302.6m smartphones worldwide, up 74.4% from the 173.5m shipped in 2009, according to research firm IDC.However, the poll found financial analysts now think it will only grow by 9% this year – although Gartner's previous full-year forecast before the quake was for 58% growth, which could at worst now be held back to just over 50%.Analysts also expect that of the major handset makers only Apple will have grown its market share when it announces its results. It is expected to have sold 15.8m iPhones in the first quarter, up 81% from a year ago. Samsung is reckoned to have sold about 13m smartphones, and Korea's LG about 4m. Both have benefited from the growing appetite for low-cost phones running Google's Android operating system.Sony Ericsson's reliance on Japanese production, especially by Sony, means the quake's effects are limiting production volume of its arc, Play and neo smartphones – delaying the wider launch of the neo to the third quarter."Given these three devices are central to Sony Ericsson's relatively narrow 2011 portfolio, there is likely to be considerable concern about the financial implications," said CCS's Wood.Sony Ericsson warned in January of a weak first quarter as it struggled to fill an awkward hole in its product portfolio. The company has to cut the prices of its old models to maintain its market position, analysts said."Older products will have to be discounted to remain somewhat relevant. Sony Ericsson really needs the new products to get to the market and ramp up quickly," Milanesi said.Nokia also warned last month it would have shortages of some of its phones as the quake is set to cause industry-wide shortage of components and raw materials sourced from Japan, but said the impact on earnings would be limited.Last week Taiwan's HTC, which was one of the quickest to assure its supply chain after the quake, reported a tripling in its first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for Android phones.
Ah, the netbook: the pet rock of the PC industry. As recent moves by Acer and Google show, it's high time to bury the netbook as a fad born out of desperation rather than a true evolution of mobile computing.Just a few years ago as PC companies confronted the abyss of the world's worst recession since the 1920s, they realized they needed lower-priced products to avoid having sales plummet along with the stock market. They also noticed the same trend that many of us have toward mobility, with factors like weight and battery life becoming as important if not more to consumers as processing power and large screens. Thus was born the netbook: a slimmed down notebook PC running Windows XP or Windows 7 Starter with a cramped keyboard and a smaller screen, generally between 7 inches and 10 inches available for around $299 or $399.For a while, it seemed netbooks could be a bridge to a mobile future, especially when combined with supports from wireless carriers like Verizon and AT&amp;T. But then came the iPad, which made it clear that demand for screens larger than a smartphone was going to be fulfilled by devices born of the new era of mobile. This is what Steve Jobs is talking about when he talks of a"post-PC era"that the legacy technologies of the PC era simply can't be crammed into smaller packages.Ever since, netbook sales have been stagnating, even falling. And two developments this week allow us to start putting nails in the coffin. Acer, which recently dumped its CEO amid exposure to falling netbook sales, released pricing information for its new Android tablet and told investors in Taiwan that "we may not be able to get back to the golden days, as notebook plus netbook may be only able to maintain single-digit growth compared to 20 to 30 percent in the past,"according to Bloomberg. This week code surfaced that Google is also readyingtablet-friendly features for Chrome OS, once pitched as an ideal Netbook companion but now increasingly labeled as a "notebook" operating system onGoogle's Chrome OS product page.There's just not room in the computing world for a device that is a compromise in every single way except price. Smaller screens and less-than-optimal keyboards make netbooks harder to use for work and play. Windows simply wasn't meant to run on devices that last for eight hours without huge and heavy extended batteries. The margins on netbooks are terrible.Google has a shot at correcting many of these objections by tackling the netbook in a truly new way, but it may not matter if the world decides that the form factor is destined for a niche role. Imagine the Christmas shopper in November 2011 considering their computing options: why pick the netbook? Tablets offer a more intuitive user experience at similar prices, cheap but full-sized notebooks won't cost all that much more than the netbook (Best Buy's Web site currently offers 70 laptops less than $600, more than any other category), and given that hardware vendors simply aren't motivated anymore to invest in netbooks given their low margins and the emergence of the tablet in the consumer mindset, there's not likely to be a lot of new and different things on store shelves.Google's hope is that corporations embrace Chrome OS netbooks as a more secure-and-reliable low-cost option for their workers, but that has always seemed like more of a sales pitch from Google than true demand that Google is poised to capture. Acer initially saidupon the departure of CEO Gianfranco Lancithat it would invest "cautiously" in the mobile market, but just a week later Wang appears to have thrown caution to the wind, saying that Acer now has an "aggressive" plan to go after the tablet market.Every industry has its fads. Google will likely try to revive interest in Netbooks when Chrome OS is finally ready, and a more sophisticated version of the CR-48 prototype Netbook could turn a few heads. But more and more, it seems like the mobile world has moved on, which could accelerate internal tension between Android and Chrome OS inside Google.(This postfirst appeared on MoCoNews.)
US broadcasters NBC and ABC have launched new iPad apps, but neither focuses on streaming live TV. Instead, NBC Live offers second-screen social features and interactivity that sync with shows being watched on TV, while ABC Video Bookstore packages archive news footage with photo galleries and interactive timelines.Both applications are now live on Apple's App Store, and are free to download – although ABC's makes use of in-app payments to buy individual "video books". The apps show that US broadcasters are looking beyond live streaming on the iPad, in the face of continuing legal tussles between cable TV providers and networks over how tablets fit into existing licensing models.NBC Liveis the latest example of the interest in social TV from broadcasters, as they look to capitalise on the fact that an increasing proportion of their viewers are watching TV with a smartphone or tablet on their laps.Armed with the slogan "Don't just watch TV, interact with TV!", it serves up trivia quizzes, polls, cast commentaries and other titbits, synchronised with the show that is being watched by the user. Video highlights of shows are also available from within the app, as is the chance to: "Join in a hosted social feed starring you, your fellow fans, and sometimes even insiders from the show."ABC Video Bookstoretakes a different angle, offering themed "video books" that combine video footage from ABC News with text, photos and interactivity. Two video books have been released for the launch of the app: A Modern Fairy Tale and The Amanda Knox Story.The first focuses on the upcoming royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, while the second hones in on the most high-profile defendant in the Meredith Kercher murder case in Italy. More video books will be added to the store regularly, according to its App Store listing.NBC Live is not available in the UK App Store, but ABC Video Bookstore is, although the in-app pricing is in dollars, with both video books costing $7.99 to download within the application.The releases come as Time Warner Cable and Viacom battle in the US courts over whether the former has the right to stream the latter's channels in its TWCable TV app for iPad.Time Warner pulled Viacom's channels from the app earlier this month after the network objected to their inclusion, but both companies are nowseeking declaratory judgement in their favour- a ruling which will have a strong impact on the tablet strategies of other cable TV providers and broadcasters in the US.
Google has been given approval for its takeover of travel search and recommendation service ITA by the US Justice Department, albeit with somefairly heavy strings attachedthat are designed to prevent the search giant taking advantage of its market position – and lining up a likely broader antitrust investigation.Nine months after Google announced its intended acquisition of ITA, the settlement reached with the Justice Department requires Google to maintain ITA's software licence with rival flight search sites for five years, as well as its research and development funding. Google will also need to stablish internal firewalls to protect information about ITA's customers and the Justice Department will be monitoring all of these requirements.Photo byHarshLighton Flickr.Some rights reservedRival travel search firms – including Expedia, TripAdvisor and Kayak (which allsome of whom use ITA's software) – had lobbied hard in opposition to the $700m takeover. A coalition that also included consolidated airfare service Sabre Holdings and called itself Fairsearch.org seemed satisfied with the restrictions placed on Google, saying in astatementthat the Justice Department's settlement would ensure "that consumers will continue to benefit from vibrant competition and innovation in travel search".Google had initially said it did not intend to launch a ticket sales service, though the Justice Department's restrictions would not stop that happening. In anofficial blog post, Google's senior vice president of commerce and local, Jeff Huber, said that Google would be able to combine its search technology with ITA's tools to "develop exciting new flight search tools"."How cool would it be if you could type 'flights to somewhere sunny for under $500 in May' into Google and get not just a set of links but also flight times, fares and a link to sites where you can actually buy tickets quickly and easily?" he wrote.Many consumers might welcome simplified, quicker, more accessible flight search and booking tools in an existing market that is still a messy and time-consuming experience, with infuriating inconsistencies and little integration between sites. Can Google help fix that?Google's brief blog post on the result makes little comment on the requirement that Google effectively fund R&amp;D for its rivals in order that they still stand a chance of competing in a market where, as the vastly dominant search service, Google would be in a position to give preferential listings to results from its own companies. That wouldn't benefit the consumer unless those results were always the cheapest or best value, hence the Justice Department's restrictions.While the overall decision will be welcome by Google, it also means more likelihood of increases scrutiny by antitrust regulators give Google's dominance of the search market. US regulators are moving towards a broader investigation of Google's search dominance, though it has not been established whether the Department of Justice of Federal Trade Commission would conduct any investigation, according toReuters.Adding to the growing momentum behind a likely investigation was a weighty report from theAmerican Antitrust Institutein February, which framed the case as "raising broader questions of  competition policy concerning Google's rapid growth as a one-of-a-kind  firm".Announcing the ITA deal approval, Senator Herb Kohl, chairman of the Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, acknowledged: "We continue to scrutinise broader questions about the fairness of Google's search engine, and whether it preferences its own products and services to the detriment of competitors."

UK mobile phone users are wasting a total of nearly £5bn a year because they are on the wrong contracts, according to a report.The overspend figure equates to almost half their spending every year on their mobile phone, or an average of £195, compared with an average spend of £439 annually.Just over three quarters (76%) of people on monthly deals are paying too much, having signed up to tariffs after wrongly estimating how many minutes and text messages they use.The study by Billmonitor, an Ofcom approved bill-analysis service, analysed millions of transactions from thousands of bills. It discovered that in total, Britain's 33m mobile subscribers are wasting nearly £5bn a year because of the problem.But it points to the scale of the challenge for subscribers hoping to get the right contract, noting that there are more than 8.5m potential mobile tariffs available. Its calculation takes into account not only tariff and handset costs but also the costs for all usage – going line by line through the customer's bill to give a 'real bill' cost.In general it says that overspending falls into three categories:• 52% of those on the wrong contract are on a tariff that's too large for them, using on average just one quarter of their monthly calling allowance (with a total waste across the UK of £2.62bn);• 29% of those on the wrong contract are on too small a tariff, wasting money on "out of allowance" calls,texts, data usage as well as other costs that could be reduced with a larger tariff (total waste: £1.53bn); and• 19% have the right level of inclusive minutes, but waste money by not optimising free benefits, data&amp; text allowances as well as other costs, or taking advantage of lower costs from 24 month contracts (total waste: £0.74bn).Only 24% of people are "not wasting anything", according to Billmonitor, set up by mathematicians in Oxford, which compiled the figures after analysing nearly 28,500 anonymous mobile phone bills. The study found that the average person spent £439 a year on their mobile phone.Customers spent £719m a year calling premium numbers and sending premium-rate texts from their mobiles, while £502mn was spent calling and texting while abroad and £1.36bn was spent on roaming charges.Users also doubled their use of data in a year, surfing the web on their smartphones, and sending an average of 300 texts a month.The results in this report are based on statistical analysis of 28,417 anonymised bills from customers with mobile contracts on O2, Orange, Vodafone and T-Mobile covering usage over the last 18 months. The analysis was carried out by the Billmonitor team together with Billmonitor's science advisers, Professor Chris Holmes and Dr Nicolai Meinshausen (both from Oxford University).

Age:60 or so.Appearance:Nervous.My favourite Canadian folk-rock group! This must be something to do with last Friday's cover story.Must it?Of course it must. First G2's writers talk about the songs that get their tears flowing, then readers chip with their stories, and finally a consensus emerges that nothing sets off the waterworks like the 1990s hit Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm. How does it go again?Ah yes: "Mmm mmm mmm mmm." You're thinking Crash Test Dummies with a capital C, T and D. We're talking about the mannequins that are strapped into cars and driven into walls.Them? Why are they are in the news?Childhood obesity. American safety campaigners are particularly worried that as kids get fatter, the mini-dummies used to test child seats become less and less relevant. There are similar fears about the adult versions.Couldn't you just shove a few sacks of potatoes up their jumpers?It's not quite that simple. Dummies have come a long way since "Sierra Sam", which the US air force used to test its ejection seats in the 50s. They're now full of electronic kit, plus their bodies are carefully designed to flail around in the same way as a flesh-and-blood human.This might sound tasteless . . .That doesn't usually stop you.. . . but couldn't you use corpses instead? Wouldn't they give more realistic results?It's been tried – but no two dead bodies react in the same way. Then there's the fact that by nature they're already damaged.Animals, then?Live pigs were used for a while. That didn't go down well with animal welfare groups.I can only see one quick and easy solution to the problem.Stop driving children everywhere so they lose a bit of weight?Actually I was thinking of tying helium balloons to them so they float.The sad thing is, that's actually much more achievable.Do say:"I'm just off to Weight Watchers . . ."Don't say:". . .

Here's a paradox: we live in an "information age" and yet information is a maddeningly elusive concept. We habitually confuse it with data, on the one hand, and with knowledge on the other. And yet it's neither. There's an arcane mathematical discipline called "information theory" that underpins all digital communications nowadays and yet resolutely disdains to make any connection between information and meaning. It would take a brave author to pursue such an elusive quarry. Or a foolhardy one.James Gleick is an accomplished stalker of mysterious ideas. His first book,Chaos(1987), provided a compelling introduction to a new science of disorder, unpredictability and complex systems. His new book,The Information, is in the same tradition. It's a learned, discursive, sometimes wayward exploration of a very complicated subject.The subtitle,A History, A Theory, A Flood, gives the game away. This is really three books: one is about the history of information from earliest times to the present day. It opens with a memorable, beautifully written chapter about the "talking drums" of the Congo and explains how a drum with just two tones was used to communicate complex information quickly over large distances. After that we embark on a journey through the history of writing, the rise of the dictionary, the growth of English, the origins of programming and the arrival of Samuel Morse and his amazing electric telegraph.The second part centres on the work of Claude Shannon, the American mathematical genius who in 1948 proposed a general theory of information. Shannon was the guy who coined the term "bit" for the primary unit of information, and provided a secure theoretical underpinning for electronic communications (so in a way he's the godfather of the modern world). The trouble was that Shannon's conceptual clarity depended on divorcing information from meaning, a proposition that to this day baffles everyone who is not an engineer.But the most startling insights in the book come when Gleick moves to explore the role of information in biology and particle physics. From the moment when James Watson and Francis Crick cracked the structure of DNA, molecular biology effectively became a branch of computer science. For the replication of DNA is the copying of information and the manufacture of proteins is a transfer of information – the sending of a message.And then there's quantum mechanics, the most incomprehensible part of physics, some of whose most eminent practitioners – such as the late John Archibald Wheeler – have begun to wonder if their field might not be, after all, just about information. "It from bit" was Wheeler's way of putting it. "Every it – every particle, every field of force, even the space-time continuum itself – derives its function, its meaning, its very existence… from bits."Finally, Gleick surveys the "flood" – the torrent of data and information that now engulfs us. In this section Gleick switches from history to speculation, which means that he is now in the same boat as the rest of us. This writer welcomes him aboard.John Naughton:The book has an astonishing range and I've learned a lot from it. It takes one into dozens of specialised fields – some of which (like quantum mechanics) are very arcane. How did you manage to do it? How many years did it take? And did you realise what you were taking on?James Gleick:I knew it was going to be a sprawling, amorphous project; I knew it would send shoots and tendrils every which way, and I didn't know exactly how I was going to find a shape. In the end it took seven years, but I'd been thinking about it one way or another for a long time. I first heard about this baffling thing, "information theory", from chaos scientists. In the 1990s I spent some time gathering material for a projected cultural history of the telephone – in other words, looking at the subject the wrong way round. And then, when I was immersed in my last book, about Isaac Newton, I started to feel that I was already writing about information more than, say, physics.JN:I found your account of the life and achievements of Ada Lovelace very moving. She has a pretty good claim to be recognised as the first computer programmer, and yet her story is a classic case-study in how brilliant women can be airbrushed from history, much as Rosalind Franklin was in the double helix story. It was good to see her being given her due.JG:I think of all the people who come and go in my book, she is my favourite. Worse than being airbrushed from history, she was never written in. She had a brief flash of celebrity as Byron's daughter, but no one, with the lone exception of Charles Babbage, had a chance to glimpse her formidable mathematical powers. We can see it now in retrospect. She could never publish under her name; never belong to a professional society; never even attend university. Yet, working with Babbage as an anonymous younger sidekick, she surpassed his vision of what his proposed computing machines could do and could be. "First programmer" is apt. She was a genius.JN:The chapters I found hardest-going were the ones on randomness and particle physics – though I was much cheered up to discover that the great Richard Feynman said that nobody understands quantum mechanics. Were these the chapters that were the most difficult to write?JG:They were the most fun to write. Finally I had reached the scientific frontier; the point where the people of interest are alive and working and available for conversation. I spent time with Gregory Chaitin [an Argentine-American prodigy in both mathematics and computer science], who has a new idea every hour, and Charles Bennett [an IBM researcher famous for applying quantum physics to the process of information exchange], who showed me "Aunt Martha's coffin" – his quantum teleportation device – buried under a pile of books and papers in a corner of his office.Hard going is OK. I take the view that we all have permission to be a little baffled by quantum information science and algorithmic information theory.JN:Claude Shannon plays a central role in the book and your portrayal of him is very vivid. One thing I hadn't known was that Shannon's PhD was on genetics viewed in terms of symbolic logic. Was that a surprise to you?JG:A complete surprise. I knew he had written an astounding master's thesis applying Boolean logic to electrical circuits, but I had no idea about the genetics work. I was thrilled to learn about it, because I knew the connection between information and genetics was going to be a big topic for me. And then it turned out that Shannon's work had not the slightest influence on modern genetics – he was in a world of his own, and the thesis vanished into academic oblivion.Yet it's a kind of intellectual story I just love. On its idiosyncratic terms Shannon's genetics work was apparently quite brilliant. This was long before anyone had any notion of DNA. "Genes" were as mysterious and hypothetical as atoms were to the ancient Greeks. Shannon said he would "speak as though the genes actually exist", and invented a bunch of arbitrary symbols and proceeded to work out rules for recombination and cross-breeding that we can see, in hindsight, were right on the money. Yet he never published it.JN:There's an interesting coincidence in the fact that the two defining breakthroughs in modern communications – the transistor and Shannon's mathematical theory of information – should have emerged from the same lab at the same time.JG:I think you know I don't consider that a coincidence. The place was right: the research laboratory run by the world's great communications empire [Bell Labs, the formidable R&amp;D arm of the AT&amp;T telephone monopoly], where all sorts of oddballs were allowed to pursue loose ends with no obvious application to the bottom line. The time was right. The first lumbering computers were walking the earth, with their big hot vacuum tubes and their Boolean circuits. Shannon had a special genius – he was obsessed with just the right motley collection of ideas needed to spawn information theory – and the transistor guys were surely special in their own ways. But these inventions were due, and willy-nilly they arrived.JN:Although Shannon's theory was a great breakthrough, his insistence on separating information from meaning must have alienated many people. Was a desire to bridge the two one of the reasons you embarked on the project?JG:Actually, that hadn't occurred to me at first. My plan from the outset was to look at the origins and the influence of what we now call information theory, believing, as I do, that it underpins so much of our information hardware and our information networks and, yes, our information age.But as you note, information is not knowledge. We are more painfully aware of that now than ever. In explaining Shannon's work I kept having to emphasise his point about the irrelevance of meaning; yet we know full well that meaning is what we really care about. This loomed larger and larger. There's a hilarious moment in 1950 in a New York hotel meeting room when Shannon tries to explain "information" to anthropologists and psychologists such as Margaret Mead and Lawrence Frank, and they're a little outraged. Where are the humans in this picture? Where are our brains? If it's just wires and transistors, who cares?And surely this is precisely our problem, now that information is cheap and plentiful and ubiquitous. I was heartened when I came across a comment by philosopher and historian Jean-Pierre Dupuy: "It was inevitable that meaning would force its way back in." I made that the epigraph for my final chapter. This is our challenge, surely.JN:Is it not the case that every shift in our communications environment has provoked "overload anxiety"? I can imagine folks in Venice in 1560 complaining about the torrent of print. Or is there something different about the present?JG:I think you're unusually empathic to imagine ancient complaints about information overload, but of course you're right. There was Leibniz bemoaning "that horrible mass of books – which keeps on growing…" When we complain that things have never been like this, it's good to have some perspective. And yet, things have never been like this. Information has never been so cheap; our choices have never been so numerous; the cacophony has never been quite so grand. Everyone knows this, and everyone is right. It's why we're fascinated, if not obsessed, with Google and Twitter and all the rest of their oddly named species. We know that information poses as many challenges as opportunities.
Only last week, one suspects along with everyone else, I had never heard of Vaughn Gittin Jr, the superbly monikered Formula D driver who guides players throughShift 2's career mode. Since then – and despite initially finding him a goateed annoyance – the man's unwavering, mostly unjustified belief in my potential for motor sport aptitude has become profoundly touching.ButShift 2is more than a bromance simulator, it's also an attempt to leaven theForza-style simulation experience with a little of stablemateHot Pursuit's bumper-to-bumper immediacy. So while there's plenty here for fans of getting clavicle-deep in engine coolants and torque ratios, novices can delegate the niceties and concentrate on the gratifyingly visceral on-track action.Key to the latter is the in-helmet perspective, all skewings, glare, spatters and whiplash-inducing jolts. Far more involving – and a good deal harder – than playing from an exterior view, the drivercam also brings out the best in the splendid, if slightly sterile, visuals (Waterloo station really has never looked so clean).Occasionally maddening (even Vaughn's condolences fall flat when a rival's shunt undoes another five laps' graft),Shift 2's wealth of unlockables, tweakables and online features should appeal nevertheless to those looking to graduate from arcade racing into full-on simulation.
Ubisoft's Raving Rabbids have not really evolved from their inaugural role as farcical bad guys in the much-lovedRaymangames. Today, the anarchic rabbits boast top billing in several multi-platform titles of varying quality.Rabbids 3D, a 3DS platformer version of the Wii party gameRaving Rabbids: Travel in Time, sits squarely in the middle of this spectrum of bunny-based gaming.Here, our Rabbid discovers a broken washing machine in which it can travel through time, offering an epic, trouble-making journey through 60-odd levels spread over four amusingly depicted historical periods: the prehistory of cavemen, ancient Egypt, classical Rome and medieval Europe.The platforming mechanic is solid if overly familiar but impressive variations in obstacles and power-ups are a welcome development. The difficulty curve is well-managed, with easy initial levels giving way to engaging challenges later, but the question of why a 2D platformer is a launch title for a 3D console is never really addressed, even if the new dimension does make for some eye-catching background scenery.Genre lovers should enjoy it, and kids will appreciate the humour, but history itself is unlikely to rememberRabbids 3Das anything more than a pleasing distraction.
When veteran UK games studio Team17 decided to revisit its classic 1991 shooterAlien Breedand update it for the Xbox generation, it was taking on an extremely testing design challenge. Innovation and nostalgia make for awkward bedfellows, and capturing the energy of a game from the past while satisfying contemporary expectations can prove an impossible task – even for the finest games makers.It's a problem that the team behindAlien Breed Trilogyhas tried to overcome, with mixed results. It's not that the three overhead shooters included here are a disappointment, because taken on merit, they're not In fact, these threeAlien Breedtitles (previously released as download-only games) sometimes offer moments that are superbly atmospheric and nerve-racking. Their world is one of classic sci-fi tropes where aggressive aliens scurry through the crisscrossed shadows of half-abandoned spacecraft, as flickering computer terminals spew sparks that light the way through darkened walkways. Passing through each level's maze of chambers and corridors, picking out monsters from the darkness with a range of rapid-fire weapons and overcoming obstacles to progress can be hugely rewarding. Simple, responsive controls make for an immediacy of experience that absolutely evokes a sense of the arcade games of the past, while the relatively impressive visuals meanABTlooks absolutely contemporary.Where the compilation fails, however, is in its pace. While the original 1990s version was a less-than-frantic experience, it had an energy its successors lack.Alien Breed Trilogyis simply deficient in the kind of vigour that so many will expect from a game with retro-fetishist leanings. In realisation, it is modern and in form it accurately fits the retro gaming mould, but in balancing these two opposites it seems to have rather lost its spirit. This is not a release that exudes confidence, and rarely does it dazzle with the sharp design and witty flourishes that make a game from any era really shine.Still,Alien Breed Trilogyis predominantly great fun, sometimes exhilarating, and constantly provides a rare chance to enjoy the all-too-unfashionable isometric top-down shooter genre that was a stalwart of 1990s gaming. Wistful gamers who remember the 2D shooter heyday of 20 years past will find plenty to enjoy here, as will today's players tired of the clumsy complexity that blights so many 3D shooters. Both, however, may find themselves hankering for a game that has a little more verve.
As any parent of pre-school children knows, there's only one TV programme they like that isn't: a) repetitive to the point of madness; b) disturbingly psychedelic; or c) outright and unashamed gibberish. That programme isPeppa Pig.A cartoon pig as imagined by Picasso (inasmuch as her eyes are both on the same side of her head), Peppa and her little brother, George, are the stars of an extensive series of everyday adventures. In their world, a pig's best friend can be a sheep or an elephant, and the same rabbit can be a librarian, an ice-cream vendor and head of the recycling centre.Consequently,Peppa Pig Theme Park Funis aimed squarely at the under-fives (the PEGI rating is 3, the minimum age at which you can be trusted not to either break your DS or cover it in drool). As befits a DS title with the youngest-possible audience in mind, there's a great deal of emphasis placed on hand/eye co-ordination, counting skills, symbol recognition and so on, all of which I'll buy. Suggesting that assisting Peppa in making a packed lunch helps appreciate the merits of a healthy diet is a stretch, though.Either way, while the adults are sneaking a bit of learning under the radar the little ones are engrossed in recreating a day at a theme park, from getting up and cleaning their teeth, to trying all the fairground rides and working the candyfloss machine (where's your healthy diet now, Peppa? Eh?). Certainly the four-year-old who dictates policy in my house was absorbed for quite some time, with the result that Peppa Pig has been elevated to deity status.
Price £14,480MPG 70.6Top speed 118mphLike a tantalising burlesque dancer, Audi knows all about building expectation. Months before it let the silken wraps fall from the burnished body of its ravishing new supermini, the press team were drip-feeding glimpses of the little car at a series of upmarket events. As long ago as last May, the first pre-launch model in Britain was sitting coyly in the centre of a grand marquee at a charity polo day in Coworth Park near Ascot. The event was attended by both princes, Harry and William, and celebrities were sprinkled around the tables like so many rose petals on a bedsheet in a five-star hotel. Harry seemed to be enjoying himself at the post-match dinner, despite the mid-chukka death of Drizzle, his favourite pony, while over at the other side of the marquee stood another big-name guest – Matt LeBlanc. That's Joey fromFriends! In real life, standing alone like a&nbsp;sitcom cut-out. Having made the most of the free bar, I decided to summon the spirit of Chandler and go and have a word  with the man who's been living in a&nbsp;box in the corner of my sitting room for about a decade.Indicating the neat little Audi parked at the edge of the dance floor, I said (rather pleased with myself): "Prince Harry seems to think he can park anywhere…" Joey nodded. Perhaps he thought I was simply telling him a&nbsp;fact. I decided to ramp it up. I pointed at Joey's jeans – he was the only man at the event not wearing pastel-coloured linen trousers: "You do know that wearing jeans in front of royalty is an act of treason." (I hugged myself with delight.) Joey looked anxiously at his legs, then at me, and then laughed and unleashed a torrent of words you wouldn't normally hear onFriends, before pounding me on the shoulder. Success! After a moment he said, "I'm a&nbsp;dirt-bike man, what's the deal with this car?""Well, Matt," I began, launching into the most surreal car conversation of my life.… "The A1 is the smallest car Audi has yet built, but it's set to be one of its biggest stars. It's Mini-sized – less than 4m long – and is a four-seat compact premium car. Diminutive and yet classy, it's the Kylie Minogue of the road. Audi has spent the past 30 years perfecting its blend of understated performance which appeals to modern urban professionals who appreciate the thrill of power. The baby A1 looks like a large Audi that's been boiled down – its Audiness has been condensed and enriched. It's the downsizer's dream car."Matt nodded. In fact, I think he  may have looked slightly glazed."There's certainly no lack of quality. The design is progressive and it feels taut and well-built. It's agile and vivid on the road, though being small a longer journey will see it at its limit. But that's not what it's about. Its dimensions mean it ducks and dives through congested streets like a sure-footed urban fox. Drivers will be able to choose between three engines: two petrol, and one diesel, with the highest MPG coming from a&nbsp;105bhp 1.6-litre TDI diesel. Standard features will include a start-stop function, energy recuperation, alloy wheels, air conditioning, a decent CD and MP3 audio system and ESP. The back seats look a bit poky, but the boot is surprisingly large. There will be numerous customisation options for both outside and the inside.  All in all, it's big-car luxury in a&nbsp;pint-sized package…"Matthadglazed over.  There was a long pause.  Then he came back to life and said: "Is this the punishment for treason?"
From The Desk Of ...Full disclosure: I haven't heard of the cartoonists, illustrators, photographers and authors whose desks have been photographed for this blog. Yet getting a peek at the private workspaces of these creative types is still fascinating.

Shift 2: Unleashed, PC, PS3 &amp; Xbox 360Shift 2: Unleashed attempts to deliver a more seat-of-the-pants feel than other racing games.Its much vaunted "True Driver Experience" system amounts to an in-car view occluded by helmet and car interior, made more confusing when your driver's perspective automatically swivels towards each corner, rendering it all but impossible to work out where your car's pointing. The same system is responsible for turning everything black and white for a few seconds after crashes to mimic driver disorientation, and spraying little patches of grease across your view – it's a set of effects that proves very hard to love. There's a solid, if unremarkable racing game buried underneath all this pointless frippery and camera-wobbling, but it's one that fails to provide either the dogged authenticity of Gran Turismo 5 or the balls-to-the-wall rush of Blur or Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit.Electronic Arts, £44.95Great Little War Game, iPad, iPhone &amp; iPod TouchGreat Little War Game.Poking your finger at maps is something any smartphone user is well used to. It's a wonder, then, that turn-based strategy games, whose very essence is map prodding, aren't more popular on touch screen devices. Great Little War Game is the latest iOS title to demand such non-dexterity-based martial prowess, with your cartoon army, navy and air force taking part in a colourful invasion. Capture oil rigs to boost income, occupy the high ground, then set about achieving each level's victory criteria while sustaining as few casualties as possible. At time of going to press, this app crashed so frequently that it was wholly unplayable on Apple's slinky new iPad 2, but issues like that tend to be ironed out rapidly in updates. Great Little War Game may not quite be Advance Wars on your iPod, but it is both a humorous and very engaging little tactical jaunt.Rubicon, £1.79Games news:Xbox Live RewardsXbox Live Rewards.Unlike Apple's App Store, which features an unknowably massive cornucopia of free content along with stuff you actually have to pay for, Xbox Live's curt nod in the direction of giveaways stretches as far as game demos and the odd new hat for your avatar. While this is unlikely to change, a new rewards programme will at least very slightly remunerate you for using your Xbox Live connection in the normal way, for example by downloading games or playing online. Although the cynical will already be anticipating a rewards catalogue full of more pointless avatar clothing and Xbox wallpapers (free to Microsoft, but with a high perceived value to you. Well, maybe not that high) although none of that has so far been announced. Early arrivers to the programme can test their 'Gaming IQ' with a nice gentle online quiz with cash prizes.
So I'm driving down the M1. It should have been the A1 because then I&nbsp;could have said I was driving along the road after which this car  was named. But it isn't, it's the M1. And it starts to rain, as it's prone to in this country. So I put on the windscreen wipers, because I'm an experienced driver who knows what to do in a situation like this. Whoosh whoosh they go, as they disperse the precipitation from my field of vision, enabling me to see the road ahead and proceed safely. I've got them on full speed because it's properly chucking it down. Whoosh&nbsp;whoosh whoosh…And then suddenly I can't see the road ahead properly. Because one of the wipers – the one on the driver's side – has whooshed right off the side of the windscreen. It's still there, but hanging off the edge like a&nbsp;swan's broken leg. Vorsprung durch totally kaputnik. And I can't see a bloody thing.Anyway, luckily I'm very nearly home, so I battle on slowly and heroically (and possibly stupidly), peering though the blur and stretching over to look through the other side. And by some miracle I&nbsp;make it home alive.I'm sure this hasn't happened before, probably never will do again. But it did happen to me. It's a PR disaster – top British motoring journalist wiped off the earth by faulty German technology… almost. The people at Audi apologise and send a lorry to take the car away, in&nbsp;disgrace.It's a shame because it had been going well up to that point. Actually, to be honest, I was initially underwhelmed by the A1's appearance. Audi's VW Polo-based supermini is smart, but hardly a head-turner. It's not interesting-looking, like the A2 was when it came out. There's nothing revolutionary about it; instead, it's chic and understated. One for the ladies, I thought, so I found one – a lady – and asked her. Yes, she thought it was nice, she said,&nbsp;smart, she wanted one, before&nbsp;adding that she wanted a&nbsp;white – or possibly a pale blue – Fiat 500 more. I would want anAlfa Romeo MiTomore, or aCitroën DS3. But I would rather have the Audi than a Mini any day. Well, any day except for a rainy one, obviously, after what happened.Inside, the A1 is all good – comfortable, classy, well-finished – as you'd expect from an Audi, and about as posh as you get for 13&nbsp;grand, which is what it starts at. It's pleasing to drive, agile around town and bigger-feeling on the open road. In fact, although I didn't fall in love with the&nbsp;A1, I'm finding it quite hard to find anything unlikable about it.

Here's another in an occasional Friday afternoon series of games-related curiosities I haven't had time to blog about fully. This week we have a mockumentary about Sonic's chum Tails, a game about malaria, another one about filth and Popcap's new experimental games studio.And above you'll see items from the newly announced Guilty Gear Accent Core PLUS Collector's Edition, a special version of the Wii, PSP and PS2 brawler hitting UK shelves on May 6. Containing limited edition art cards by Guilty Gear creator Daisuke Ishiwatari as well as T-shirts, keychains, soundtracks and the like, there will only be 200 available, all of them from UK distributor Zen's ownonline store.Tragic TailsCreated by freelance writerMichael Leader, alongside palsNick MoranandEdward Szekely, Behind The Bytes is a, 'silly mockumentary series in the style of Behind the Music, but about video game characters'. The first in the series is on YouTube now and it charts the rise and fall of Tails, Sonic the Hedgehog's loveable but – it turns out – psychologically troubled sidekick. Leader and co have got the format of these celebrity documentary shows exactly right, and the result is pretty funny, especially the simmering resentment that brews when Knuckles arrives on the scene.Popcap goes (experi)mentalThe developer behind polished puzzling blockbusters Bejeweled, Zuma and Plants vs Zombies has opened an experimental games label. Named4th &amp; Batteryafter the intersection where Popcap's Seattle office is based, the studio will produce smallscale, edgier titles. The first title to emerge from this intriguing chrysalis will be Unpleasant Horse, featuring a flying equine anti-hero that destroys small birds and attacks other horses from above. It's due out on iOS platforms at the end of the month and will be free to download."The PopCap brand has become closely associated with ultra-high quality, polish and attention to detail — which is a great thing," says Ed Allard, Popcap's Executive Vice President of Studios. "But our standard game development process is therefore long and involved, and doesn't really accommodate all of the creativity pumping through our collective veins. 4th &amp; Battery gives us a way to quickly try really strange or marginal ideas, and to give our designers a safe area to hone their chops."It's a neat idea, and the sort of thing I expect to see more of in the future. Most major studios have times where groups of staff are left with little to do, often at the end of a project. Getting them to bash out strange little downloadable games is surely a better use of their time than clearing out their email in-boxes. As for further games in 4th &amp; Battery's diary, Popcap co-founder Jason Kapalka simply tells us to, "Expect weirdness." We always do.Talking about weirdness if you're a truly committed fan of Popcap's titles you'll be pleased to know that the company has made some official soundtracks available online.

Players must track down a series of words associated with dirt and disease, using cryptic clues to guess at the missing letters. Think of it as dirty hangman. No wait, don't think of that.It's quite compelling, especially as, when you guess a word correctly you get a link to a relevant web article so you get to learn lots of interesting things about squalor and hygiene through the ages.Swotting up on MalariaBrowser games have become a popular way for charities to spread information about their causes, and here's a simple but very worthwhile new example.Swat the Mozzyis a 'whack-a-mole' derivative, challenging you to splatter as many disease-carrying mosquitoes as possible within the time limit: the highest scorers will get the chance to win a range of prizes. The game has been commissioned by Malaria No More in preparation for World Malaria day on April 25. Although preventable and treatable the disease claims 781,000 lives a year, with children in Africa the most common victims.
Creating the yearly updated version of a barnstorming franchise like Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf must require the skills of a tightrope walker – you wouldn't want to mess with a consistently successful formula, but you've got to give people a reason to fork out their cash on it. This year's effort boasts two innovations: a full digital rendition of the Masters, that most prestigious of majors, and, for the first time, a virtual caddie who accompanies you on your quest to qualify for Augusta.The virtual caddie works sufficiently well that it seems odd that nobody has thought to add one to a golf game in the past. It's obviously a help for beginners – suggesting shots and clubs, and even helping with your aim – but what really impresses is that, thanks to some impressive AI, its advice becomes more sophisticated as your skills improve. It is linked to a Course Mastery system, with objectives for each course you tackle divided into Gold, Silver and Bronze; the more of these you master, the more imaginative your caddie becomes.Before long, he or she will be teaching you the intricacies of spin, fade, lay-ups and so on – all essential skills if you are to master the game fully. And pithy comments are always on hand should you make the occasional lapse.In effect, that adds an RPG element to your career progression, and the Road to the Masters – essentially the game's career mode – is surely the most coherent single-player game ever seen in a Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf game. You start off with a nine-hole amateur competition, but if your skills are significantly above those of the average weekend hacker, you're soon pitched into the Nationwide and PGA Tours. Work your way into the world's top 100, and you will be invited to play in the Masters. Although you can, of course, jump straight into the Masters away from the career mode.The familiar Challenges from recent Tiger Woods games have also been given a Masters flavour. This time around, you're invited to recreate classic Masters Moments from the past, such as Phil Mickelson's miraculous escape from the trees in 2010. These, as ever, are tricky but rewarding. Curiously, the courses you're given in the box vary according to what console you favour: on Xbox 360 and PS3, you get 15 courses, but a further 20 will become available as paid-for DLC. The Wii version, on the other hand, has 25 courses, but won't be getting any others.There's good news, though, for those who favour working on their swing while playing: the PS3 Move control system has been completely rewritten, as has the Wii's system, which has been redesigned to accommodate the Wii Motion Plus and even, for those who are braver than average, the Wii Balance Board. You can play online via EA's GamerNet system, which takes a leaf out of Need For Speed's Autolog, by letting you design your own challenges for your mates.Overall, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 is very impressive indeed. It looks fabulous, the control system is exemplary in terms of both the control it gives and its flexibility, and the addition of both the Masters and the caddie system should make it more or less irresistible to golf nuts. While the player whose name it bears may still be making his comeback from a disastrous period, his video game at least still towers above all its peers.• Game reviewed on Xbox 360
Valve faced a daunting task when it decided to build a sequel to Portal. After all, how does one improve on a title that most gamers consider to be just about flawless?Originally released as part of the Orange Box, Portal was – and still is – an immaculately constructed FPS puzzler, ingenious in its design and underpinned by a darkly humorous yarn. The only complaint you could level at it concerned its brevity, but even that didn't seem to bother many people. Short, smart and perfectly formed, Portal was the complete package. So what need did it have for a sequel?And yet, in the next couple of weeks, Portal 2 ships and players will likely return to the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center – the human behaviour research facility from the first game – in their droves. Or rather, what's left of it. As the game opens, it's revealed that Aperture is a mess. The smooth, sanitised surfaces have been shattered. Rooms are filled with smashed debris and jungle overgrowth. The place looks like it's been hit by an earthquake. According to Portal 2's writer, Chet Faliszek, Aperture's facelift is Valve's way of establishing the game's story from the off."The first Portal kind of sneaked up on people," he smiles, "and we'd love to have done that for the sequel because we're really lazy and that would have been easy to do. But hey, the jig is up! Portal has a story. So instead, we want the player to know right off that something's wrong so we pound on their expectations. And we pound them with Merchant!"Merchant, in this case, is Stephen Merchant, who provides the voice of the first character the player meets – a hovering droid named Wheatly. In the opening stages of the game, Wheatly reveals to the player that Aperture's been wrecked by "some sort of apocalyptic event" and steers them back into the training facility and towards a Portal Gun.His dialogue is a stream of nervous pronouncements and laugh-out-loud gags, which apparently boiled out of some writing jam sessions involving Merchant, Faliszek and the rest of the Portal 2 crew. It's a nice way of establishing the game's black comedy; Portal was a story of how events can take a horrible turn for the worse if everything is left exclusively to logic – as personified in that game by GlaDOS, the malevolent female AI who tried to kill the player – and Portal 2 picks up that theme and runs with it."I just love the idea of a place where science and logic have been placed so far ahead of everything else," says Faliszek, "as if that's the only way human beings can advance. It's 'science first' and everything else is 'meh'!"Once Wheatly plops the player back into Aperture's test course, the puzzle solving begins. The facility might be a wreck but its doors, pressure pads, elevators, forcefields and numerous other test apparatus still work. Naturally, the Portal Gun makes a return and so too do its mind-bending abilities. Players can use it to punch two portals that can connect most of the surfaces in their surroundings. Cubes are, thankfully, still in abundance when needed.Over the first few levels of the game's first Chapter, the player proceeds through a brief tutorial disguised as some fairly easy tests. Gradually the difficulty level starts to ramp up and the solution to each new test room becomes more and more challenging. As in the original game, the puzzles in Portal 2 are pitched perfectly; beyond the tutorials, which are deliberately easy, none of the test rooms I encountered were too basic, yet none were eye-wateringly hard."We were aiming for more complexity," says Faliszek. "We didn't want to make the game too difficult, but we wanted Portal 2 to be more complex than Portal 1 and the only way to do that is through testing. And then more testing."We couldn't do it otherwise. We watch hours and hours of play-testing. We start with a basic idea for a puzzle, have some players run through it, and then depending on how fast theu solve it – or don't – we know what we need to tweak Maybe moving a wall here. Maybe making something a bit more obvious there …"Once the first trials are over, the player is reunited with Wheatly, who guides them into the facility's breaker room – a massive rotund area filled with switches. Once Wheatly activates the room's elevator, the pair of the are pushed upwards to the surface and into a room filled with metal debris – and it's here the game's most famous character makes her return.As Wheatly mutters away about trying to hack into Aperture's databases to allow himself and the player to escape, the wreckage behind him begins to reassemble itself. Within moments, GlaDOS's cracked sing-song voice rings out. She remembers the player from the first game – "when you MURDERED me" – and has decided to reactivate Aperture's more deadly test courses. After disposing of Wheatly, she dumps the player back down into the facility …… and it's here, unfortunately, that the demo ends, leaving me with a whole host of questions for Faliszek about what more we can expect from the game."The problem with showing Portal 2's content beyond the introduction level is that it would give away a lot of the story and a lot of the twists," he says. "All we can do is show you a very compressed training course. There's a bunch of new stuff, but we can't show it all without giving away spoilers."According to Faliszek, though, Portal 2 boasts a huge amount of content and mechanics to aid in the single-player puzzles. Aerial Faith Plates are springboards that send the player hurtling through the air. Propulsion Gel, which allows the player to slide quickly across floors and build up massive speeds. Repulsion Gel, which allows the player to create areas they can bounce on to cover huge distances. Excursion funnels, which operate like anti-gravity travel tunnels that can be directed around the map with the Portal Gun.Faliszek says that each new element will be introduced with a couple of easy levels, so players can familiarise themselves with the mechanics, and then, naturally, the difficulty will rise.Finally, Portal 2 also boasts a two-player co-op mode, which in an age where every shooter seems to have to contain one, doesn't sound tacked on or forced. The co-op mode features two new characters – two Aperture Facility bots – and a standalone story that is separate from the single-player as well as its own set of maps. In it, two players will have to work through a series of tests that can only be solved through successful teamwork."The co-op kind of came from Portal 1," says Faliszek. "You'd be sitting on the couch and your friends would be sitting around you and they'd be helping you solve the game. So we wanted to create a situation where at least one of them had a controller too."Indeed, it looks like a lot of Portal 2's content – from its new mechanics, its new multiplayer mode to the long list of well-balanced brand new puzzles – seems to have been made possible through Valve's close studying of the behaviour of its game's audience. By all accounts, the developer sounds a little bit like Aperture itself – minus, of course, any lethal tendencies."We never inflict actual pain on our audience or testers for real," laughs Faliszek, "as much as we would have liked to."•Portal 2 is out on 21 April on PS3, PC/Mac and Xbox 360
A survey of more than 1,400 tablet owners in the US by Google's AdMob subsidiary has found that gaming is the most popular use for these devices, considerably ahead of music, video and ebooks.According to the survey, 84% of tablet owners play games, ahead of even searching for information (78%), emailing (74%) and reading the news (61%). 56% of tablet owners use social networking services on their device, while 51% consume music and/or videos, and 46% read ebooks.AdMob does not break out which tablets were owned by the users, but the survey was conducted in March this year, at a point when Apple's iPad accounted for the lion's share of the tablet market in the US – although Samsung's Galaxy Tab had also been available for a few months.The survey found that 38% of respondents spend more than two hours a day using their tablets, while another 30% spend 1-2 hours. It appears that tablets are predominantly domestic devices, with 82% of people primarily using their tablets at home, versus 11% who say they are used primarily on the go, and 7% who said at work.28% of respondents say their tablet is now their primary computer, while 43% say they spend more time using their tablet than they do their desktop or laptop computer.It's the games stat that provides the biggest surprise though. It's not shocking that games are popular on tablets: the App Store charts for iPad apps make that crystal clear already. However, this is the first survey where games have come ahead of email as a usage for tablets.What's missing from Google's survey, though, is data on time spent doing these various activities – for example, comparing the proportion of heavy tablet gamers with heavy emailers.
