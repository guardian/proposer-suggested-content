Apple has removed an application called ThirdIntifada from its App Store following complaints that it encouraged and glorified violence against Israel.Israeli minister of public affairs Yuli Edelstein sent an email to Apple chief executive Steve Jobs calling for the "immediate removal" of the application.He described ThirdIntifada as"an anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist application that (...) calls for an uprising against Israel", according to Haaretz.The Simon Wiesenthal Centre alsocomplained about the app, which it said "contains anti-Israel content – articles, photographs of 'martyrs' and stories – and updates its users on further incitements to protest and violence."Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said the app was removed "because it violates the developer guidelines by being offensive to large groups of people."Intifada is the Arabic term for two violent uprisings against Israel over the past two decades. The free application encouraged followers to share opinions and organise protests against Israel.The app also linked to a website that helped organise recent violent clashes with Israeli troops along the country's borders with Lebanon and Syria.In March,Facebook pulled a page called the Third Palestinian Intifadafrom its site, which called for one million supporters to join forces in an uprising against Israel after Friday prayers on 15 May.
A rogue member of hacker group LulzSec is suspected to have been responsible for a hack last weekend which resulted in the theft of $9m worth of online currency.The hack focused around a "currency exchange" calledMtGox, which provides a method for swapping Bitcoins – an untraceable, cryptographically created online currency favoured by web activists and hackers – for real US dollars.The attack – which could cost members of LulzSec and fellow collective Anonymous thousands of dollars each – suggests other, more profit-focused hacking groups may be stepping up activity in response to the more high-profile politicised ones.LulzSec has denied any involvement in the Bitcoin hack. The group has also denied any link to attacks on the websites ofgames company Segaand theUK Office for National Statistics.Late on Sunday MtGox was compromised when a hacker tried to sell more than 400,000 Bitcoins – 6% of all the virtual currency presently in circulation – for an initial price of $17.50 each, which would have netted $7m at a constant price.But the attempt to sell such a large volume of coins at once drove the value of the currency down almost to zero, before trading on the site was suspended.More than 60,000 users' details were also compromised in the attack and have since been posted publicly in dozens of places across the internet. Trading on the MtGox site has still not been reinstated since the attack, leaving the future of the fledgling currency in doubt.Bitcoins are produced without the involvement of governments or banks; instead, they are generated by using software (also called Bitcoin). The idea was created in 2009 by a Japanese programmer.Bitcoins are not issued by a central authority, but instead generated by a mathematical algorithm after computers complete a certain number of complex calculations.Some of the most experienced members of the Anonymous and LulzSec hacker collectives are believed to have had "botnets" – hijacked networks of PCs – of more than 100,000 compromised computers.If that many machines were set to work generating Bitcoins, they could create up to $7,500 worth a day at current trading levels – meaning members of the hacker collectives could be among the biggest losers if the value does not recover as and when MtGox reopens. In the hours before the hack the total value of Bitcoins in circulation was more than $150m.Anonymity and security are key features of the currency, which has attracted controversy after being used in sites selling drugs and pornography.High-profile organisations accepting the coins include WikiLeaks and the US lobby group Electronic Frontiers Foundation, which have suspended their acceptance of bitcoins in the wake of the hack.MtGox says access to its site was gained after a financial auditor's computer was hacked, and insists its site was not compromised.But Amir Taaki, who runs the rival Bitcoin exchangeBritcoin.co.uk, disputes this chain of events. Developers working on his site, which runs on much of the same software as MtGox, found a security hole several days before the hack was carried out. He says MtGox was notified publicly and privately of the problem."Due to the recent events at MtGox.com, we at Britcoin have decided to move our servers to a new location," read a Britcoin statement. "MtGox suffered an SQL injection [a form of hacking attack that creates direct access to databases and files] which means access to the site's funds were in the hands of the malicious hacker. As such, until we see evidence to the contrary, for security reasons we are assuming that MTGox has none of its clients' Bitcoins."Other senior coders in the Bitcoin community claim to have been offered the full database of MtGox users days before the hack was carried out. Though they had not verified whether the database was genuine, it came from the same intermediary who has been testing interest in selling or distributing details from the Sega Pass hack.Members of LulzSec, the hacker groupwhose alleged member Ryan Cleary was arrested in Essex on Tuesday, denied responsibility for the Sega Pass hack, as did several members of Anonymous.The recent spate of hacks denied by both groups – neither of which usually seeks to hide from the limelight – raises the possibility of a third, as yet unnamed, group of hackers carrying out the attacks.Lulzsec and Anonymous members stand to lose a significant amount of money if Bitcoins fail. Several members of both groups – speaking directly and through intermediaries – claim to know of others using thousands of hacked computers to generate Bitcoins.
When President Eisenhower left office in 1960,he provided the American people with a warning."In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist."Sixty years later, the military-industrial complex has been joined by another unprecedented centre of what has increasingly proven to be "misplaced power": the dozens of secretive firms known collectively as the intelligence contracting industry.Last February, three of these firms – HBGary Federal, Palantir and Berico, known collectively as Team Themis –were discovered to have conspired to hire out their information war capabilitiesto corporations which hoped to strike back at perceived enemies, including US activist groups, WikiLeaks and journalist Glenn Greenwald. That such a dangerous new dynamic was now in play was only revealed due to a raid by hackers associated with the Anonymous collective, resulting in thedissemination of more than 70,000 emailsto and from executives at HBGary Federal and affiliated company HBGary.After having spent several months studying those emails and otherwise investigating the industry depicted therein,I have revealed my summaryof aclassified US intelligence programme known as Romas/COIN, as well as its upcoming replacement, known as Odyssey. The programme appears to allow for the large-scale monitoring of social networks by way of such things as natural language processing, semantic analysis, latent semantic indexing and IT intrusion. At the same time, it also entails the dissemination of some unknown degree of information to a given population through a variety of means – without any hint that the actual source is US intelligence. Scattered discussions of Arab translation services may indicate that the programme targets the Middle East.Despite the details I have provided in the document – which is also nowin the possession of several major news outletsand which may be published in whole or in part by any party that cares to do so – there remains a great deal that is unclear about Romas/COIN and the capabilities it comprises. The information with which I've worked consists almost entirely of email correspondence between executives of several firms that together sought to win the contract to provide the programme's technical requirements, and because many of the discussions occurred in meetings and phone conversations, the information remaining deals largely with prospective partners, the utility of one capability over another, and other clues spread out over hundreds of email exchanges between a large number of participants.The significance of this programme to the public is not limited to its potential for abuse by facets of the US intelligence community, which has long been proverbial for misusing other of its capabilities. Perhaps the most astonishing aspect is the fact that the partnership of contracting firms and other corporate entities that worked to obtain the contract was put into motion in large part by Aaron Barr, the disgraced former CEO of HBGary Federal who was at the centre of Team Themis's conspiracy to put high-end intelligence capabilities at the disposal of private institutions. As I explain further in the linked report, this fact alone should prompt increased investigation into the manner in which this industry operates and the threats it represents to democratic institutions.Altogether, the existence and nature of Romas/COIN should confirm what many had already come to realise over the past few years, in particular: the US and other states have no intention of allowing populations to conduct their affairs without scrutiny. Such states ought not complain when they find themselves subjected to similar scrutiny – as will increasingly become the case over the next several years.• Editor's note: The headline and photo caption in this article originally alluded to HBGary. HBGary Federal is the company in question, which is a distinct entity from HBGary Inc. The article has been amended to make that clarification at 9am (BST) on 23 June 2011
The British census was not hacked and claims that it was unlawfully accessed by the notorious internet collective LulzSec were "a hoax",  the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday.Government officials on Tuesday launched an investigation into claims that information about tens of millions of Britons had been stolen by computer hackers LulzSec.However, Glen Watson, the census director, said that the investigation had found "no sign of any suspicious activity" in relation to its records."I can reassure the public that their census records are secure," he said. "We have strict measures in place protecting the nation's census information."LulzSecdenied claimsthat it attempted to steal census data after what appeared to be a public admission from the groupappeared online.Watson said: "The claim that hackers got in looks like a hoax and our investigation concluded that there is no sign of any suspicious activity. The alleged hackers have also denied any involvement."However, we are not complacent and will remain vigilant. The security and confidentiality of census data remain our top priority."Earlier on Wednesday, Britain's top policeman, Sir Paul Stephenson,describedthe hacker collective's actions as "deeply worrying", following attacks on the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and the CIA.
Politicians and live television performers once had to learn their material, or be able to ad-lib fluently, delivering their words believably and with conviction. Hubert Schlafly, who has died aged 91, changed all that. As the inventor of the teleprompter, he opened up political oratory and television news broadcasts to anyone who could read and deliver scrolling four-word lines.In 1948, Schlafly – better known as "Hub" – was the director of television research for 20th Century-Fox. The actor Fred Barton suggested the idea of&nbsp;a&nbsp;viewable script machine to Fox's vice-president of television and radio, Irving Berlin Kahn (a nephew of the composer Irving Berlin). They asked their friend Schlafly, an engineer by&nbsp;trade, if there was anything he could do. "I said it would be a piece of cake," Schlafly recalled.What he came up with was a suitcase-sized machine with a motorised scroll of paper, controlled by a stagehand. When Fox declined to invest in further research, the three men set up their own company, TelePrompTer, and sold their first model to the CBS network, where it made its debut with the daytime soap opera The First Hundred Years, in 1950.Two years later, Herbert Hoover used a teleprompter to address a Republican party convention to nominate Dwight Eisenhower for president. When Hoover's ad-libs caused the operator to stop the machine, Hoover had to ask that it be restarted. In 1954, the teleprompter made its debut at the BBC, when it was used with remarkable smoothness by Peter Dimmock to present Sportsview.Schlafly was born in St Louis, Missouri. He obtained a degree in electrical engineering at the University of Notre Dame in 1941 and then worked for General Electric and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's radiation research laboratory before joining Fox in 1947.Despite the early successes of the teleprompter, many programmes still relied on handheld cue cards with which assistants could move between cameras, but they required deft coordination and&nbsp;were distractions to the cast, crew and audience on a set. Schlafly spent years supervising refinements to his basic design, replacing paper scrolls with mirror screens and television monitors, coordinating screens with studio cameras, and trying to make the device more user-friendly.Meanwhile, as president of TelePrompTer corporation, he proved his abilities as an executive. The company became an early player in the US cable television market, investing in franchises, with Schlafly personally heading development of the technology for the first pay-per-view systems, for which he was recognised with an Emmy in 1992. He received a second Emmy, in&nbsp;1999, this time recognising the&nbsp;creation of the teleprompter.Another of Schlafly's inventions proved even more important to the development of television, particularly live news. In 1973, he and Sidney Topol devised a transportable satellite receiver that was the forerunner of&nbsp;today's dishes. With it, they broadcasted an&nbsp;address by Carl Albert, the speaker of the House of Representatives, from Washington to a cable-television convention in Anaheim, California.Schlafly was credited with a total of&nbsp;16 patents. In 2008 he was inducted into the Cable Television Hall of Fame. In his acceptance speech, he used a&nbsp;teleprompter himself for the first time.His wife, Leona, died in 2003.• Hubert Joseph Schlafly, inventor, born 14&nbsp;August 1919; died 20 April 2011
From theWordpress.org (that is, the code development site, not the blog hosting site, which is Wordpress.com):Earlier today the WordPress team noticed suspicious commits to several popular plugins (AddThis, WPtouch, and W3 Total Cache) containing cleverly disguised backdoors. We determined the commits were not from the authors, rolled them back, pushed updates to the plugins, and shut down access to the plugin repository while we looked for anything else unsavory.We're still investigating what happened, but as a prophylactic measure we've decided to force-reset all passwords on WordPress.org. To use the forums, trac, or commit to a plugin or theme, you'll need to reset your password to a new one. (Same for bbPress.org and BuddyPress.org.)They also offer standard good advice:As a user, make sure to never use the same password for two different services, and we encourage you not to reset your password to be the same as your old one.Second, if you use AddThis, WPtouch, or W3 Total Cache and there's a possibility you could have updated in the past day, make sure to visit your updates page and upgrade each to the latest version.Wordpress has had similar problems in the past, including an occasion when afake "new" versionwas rolled out with abackdoorin it.Meanwhile Dropbox, the digital locker service, has had to face the fact that itbroke its own authentication system for four hours on Tuesday- which meant that anyone could log in to anyone else's account. Dropbox says that it thinks only 1% of people logged into accounts in that time, though of course it doesn't know if they were the ones who weremeantto log in to them.Many people might say "no harm done - all that's happened is that someone might stick some files in your Dropbox." Yes, or read them. Or, as someone suggested, stick a malware-infected file in. It's a bad lapse for Dropbox. There's enough hacking going on as it is without this.
A British teenager arrested as part of an investigation into cyber-attacks in Britain and the United States has been charged with five offences of hacking websites.Ryan Cleary, 19, was charged with a cyber-attack on Monday on Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the same day he was arrested at his family's home in Wickford, Essex.His arrest was linked to a series of cyber-attacks by a group called LulzSec, which investigators believe had targeted websites including ones belonging to the US Central Intelligence Agency, the US Senate and the electronics giant Sony.Cleary was charged over cyber-attacks against British-based targets. The investigation into whether he is involved in any other attacks, including ones outside the UK, is continuing.The Metropolitan police said Cleary had been charged with three specific attacks – on the London based International Federation of the Phonographic Industry in November 2010, the British Phonographic Industry in October 2010, as well as on Soca.The method he is alleged to have used is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against all three websites. He was also charged with constructing a botnet, a network of infected computers that can be used remotely to direct attacks.In a statement, police said Cleary "did conspire with other person or persons unknown to conduct unauthorised modification of computers by constructing and distributing a computer program to form a network of computers (a botnet) modified and configured to conduct Distributed Denial of Service attacks"The final charge against him alleges Cleary "made, adapted, supplied or offered to supply an article, namely a botnet, intending that it should be used to commit, or to assist in the commission of, an offence".The Metropolitan police said: "A 19-year-old man has this afternoon been charged with offences under the Criminal Law Act and Computer Misuse Act by officers from the Metropolitan police service's police central e-crime unit (PCeU)."Scotland Yard cyber crime detectives spent Tuesday and Wednesday questioning Cleary over the attacks carried out by the LulzSec group, which mostly targeted websites belonging to institutions and companies in the US.Computer equipment seized from his home was examined to see if it contained evidence linking him to the attacks.Cleary will appear at City of Westminster magistrates court on Thursday morning.The events leading to the arrest of Cleary involved an investigation by British police and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI's involvement, plus the nature of the targets, raised the prospect that Washington may seek the teenager's extradition to the US.Richard Heatley from the Crown Prosecution Services's Complex Casework Unit said: "We have today advised the Metropolitan Police Service to charge Ryan Cleary with one offence of conspiracy to contravene the provisions of the Computer Misuse Act 1990, three offences of committing an unauthorised act with intent contrary to Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and one offence of making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in an offence under Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 contrary to Section 3A of the Computer Misuse Act 1990."This follows the arrest of Ryan Cleary in relation to suspected commission of offences contrary to the Computer Misuse Act. The decision was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors."The activities of LulzSec have highlighted the power of cyber criminals to cause disruption and damage.Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said: "The challenges around cyber crime are extraordinarily significant and deeply worrying."Separately, the Office for National Statistics has confirmed that the British census was not hacked.Government officials decided to launch an investigation into claims that information about tens of millions of Britons had been stolen by LulzSec.Glen Watson, the census director, said in a statement: "I can reassure the public that their census records are secure. We have strict measures in place protecting the nation's census information."LulzSec denied that it attempted to steal census data after an apparent admission from the group appeared online.Watson added: "The claim that hackers got in looks like a hoax and our investigation concluded that there is no sign of any suspicious activity. The alleged hackers have also denied any involvement."However, we are not complacent and will remain vigilant. The security and confidentiality of census data remain our top priority."
Apple is on track to release an "iPhone 5" in September, according to reports from component suppliers in Asia who are gearing up to build the next generation of the company's smartphone.Although reports vary on the naming – with some sources suggesting that it will be called the iPhone 4G or 4S – the Guardian has been told that the form of the device is very similar to the existing iPhone 4, which was released in summer 2010.The suppliers are also understood to be preparing for another iPhone release during 2012, though the timing on that is less certain. Some are suggesting that the next model could come out in March.The Guardian understands that while the new version will look very like the iPhone 4, it may dispense with some of the visible buttons on the side of the device for volume control.Other reports onBloombergsuggest that the new phone will use an A5 processor like that included in the iPad 2 released in March and feature an 8MP camera (compared with 5MP in the iPhone 4). Some reports suggest that it is testing a higher-resolution or larger version of the screen than that in the present model.The new devices will include Apple's new iOS 5 software, which includes itsiCloud capabilityto synchronise data between devices, and to activate and update phones without requiring connection to a computer, as well as offering photo sharing and Twitter messaging across many apps.Richard Windsor, global technology marketing analyst at Nomura Securities, said he expected the version sold in September to have the same price as the existing one, which Apple sells for about $600. "We think there will be an iPhone 5 in September – the suppliers have been ramping up for it," he said.The key question, said Windsor, will be whether Apple introduces a mid-range phone at about $300 in order to capture a larger share of the market. If that happens, he suggests, Apple's share of the smartphone market – currently about 19% of the 100m devices sold per quarter – could explode as the market itself grows in this year and 2012.But Windsor said he has not seen any sign that Apple is preparing a "mid-range" phone so far for launch early next year, which would be needed to capture a significant slice of the market.Phones running Google's Android operating system have taken a dominant share of the smartphone market in the past six months, with a 31% share in the first quarter. Android pushed ahead of Nokia, whose Symbian operating system had been the leading smartphone platform for years, in the first quarter of this year. Apple is in third place, though analysts expect Apple to pass Nokia in the current quarter which ends in just over a week.The smartphone market is expected to grow 55% this year to 472m and to hit 1bn units by 2015,according to the research company IDC. With Android devices and, from October, Nokia devices running Microsoft's Windows Phone software competing for that market, it may become imperative for Apple to produce a mid-range device to capture more revenue, as it did in the music player market when it launched the iPod Mini, iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle.IDC expects that Android will grow to more than 40% of the market by the end of 2011, while Windsor at Nomura expects Apple to pass Nokia to take second place in smartphone sales to Samsung.The new iPhone would be hotly anticipated but Apple will want to play down the reports ahead of the summer season in case it affects sales.
AnonymousBorn out of the online messageboard 4Chan in 2003, the shadowy group's first high-profile target was the Church of Scientology.

OK, so we all feel we've had our fill of zombie adventuring over the past few years, but at least some video game developers are attempting to improvise on the familiar theme of the undead apocalypse. While Techland is attempting to bring an emotional family dynamic to its open world thriller Dead Island, French studios Lexis Numérique and VectorCell have been inspired by the legendary Ico for their forthcoming PSN title.AMYAMYis set 20 years in the future. A comet has crashed into Earth spreading a zombifying virus, and a young woman named Lana is caught up in the chaos. Trapped in a small midwestern town, her future looks bleak until she crosses paths with the eponymous Amy, and eight-year-old autistic girl with strange powers. The player's role is to protect this strange child as the duo attempt to flee the town, past the crowds of shuffling monsters.AMYAs in Ico, you can press a button to take hold of Amy's hand and guide her around the environment – you can even feel her heart pumping through the rumble effect on the pad (and that lets you know how stressed she is – which is apparently an important element). In return, she offers healing properties: in an interesting twist on the idea of zombie contagion, Lana can allow herself to become partially infected in order to pass by groups of undead savages – but she needs Amy nearby to heal her and prevent the disease from consuming them both.Paul Cuisset, the game's director and head of VectorCell, is a French video game veteran, previously responsible for founding one of the county's great studios, Delphine. Now defunct, the company was responsible for some of the most fascinating and eccentric adventure titles of the nineties including Cruise for a Corpse and Another World (written by Éric Chahi who is also now working on an interesting downloadable title,From Dust).VectorCell has released a short development diary, which you can watch above. It's short, but it handily lists just about every trendy new graphics technique currently available. See if you can drop at least two of these into casual conversation today.AMYis due out via PS3 download later this summer.
Dead Island caused a major splash earlier in 2011, courtesy ofan incredibly clever CGI trailerwhich set up its premise of an idyllic island over-run by zombies, and went well and truly viral. That was all very well, but what of the game itself?Before E3, publisher Deep Silver performed a demo, revealing that it is essentially a zombie-RPG, in which you have to use found objects to fight off zombies, building up your skills and fashioning more powerful weapons by improvising on workbenches as you progress.Which looked promising, and at E3, we were able to confirm that promise thanks to a sustained hands-on session with the game.We participated in the game's four-player co-op mode, running on four Xbox 360s networked together. This was pretty indicative of general gameplay – although it was comforting to have three other zombie-bashers around at all times (a role that would intermittently be taken up by AI-controlled colleagues in the single-player game).We began by choosing our character and thereby class – I opted for Logan, who specialises in throwing-weapons. The mission began in a church, which was a safe haven, where we were able to stock up on weapons and use the workbench to customise them – turning knives, for example, into sticky-bombs, and electrifying objects such as baseball bats and oars.Mods and upgradesWe had been given a leg-up: a healthy amount of in-game currency to buy mods – abilities you acquire as you progress through the game, such as the know-how to make sticky bombs, the ability to wield a torch and so on.Once we were satisfied with our weaponry – an assortment of melee weapons including axes, plus knives – it was time to venture out. There are guns in Dead Island, but they are few and far between, and ammo is very rare indeed. The focus of the game is very much on meleeing.Meeting the zombiesCollectively, we had a simple mission: to walk around the surrounding area in what would eventually become a circle, periodically putting up posters for a fellow-survivor who was trying to find his family – somewhat futile, we thought, but what can you do? This provided ample opportunity for checking out the different types of zombies, as well as the game's mechanics.Realistic zombie-huntingDead Island's key intention is to be as realistic as possible (once you've suspended disbelief sufficiently to allow for the presence of zombies), which is why it concentrates on melee weapons.There is a stamina system which forces you to time your attacks as precisely and economically as you can – launch into an indiscriminate flurry of blows, and you'll run out of puff, becoming a sitting duck.There is one useful concession, though: a kick which doesn't cost any stamina and which, Resident Evil-style, is dead handy for clearing space when you're surrounded by the undead. Pressing the A button while moving left launched a dodge move, which was particularly useful when zombies charged you.Zombie typesDeep Silver has gone to town with its zombies – there are several different types, including giant juggernauts, which take a lot of bringing down; suicide-zombies, which explode a short while after you take them down; and fast-movers, who charge at you and cause a vast amount of damage.You soon learn that you have to take a tactical approach. The chargers, for example, are best tackled from a distance, using a throwing weapon – the sticky bombs are ideal for them.You also get a Rage meter which fills up as you kill zombies; when it's full, you can launch a special attack. In my case, as the knife-throwing specialist, it launched a short period in which I could throw an incredible number of knives at the speed of a machine-gun.Use of these special moves had to be judicious; they were worth saving to take out the more sophisticated zombies, especially the juggernauts.Gameplay and ambienceOur co-op sample of Dead Island really whetted our appetite for the game. Its controls were responsive and satisfying (you can, for example, do a great head-stomp on prostrate zombies).The idyllic island surroundings, messed up by the zombie infestation, were great to behold and very convincing – and, perhaps more importantly than any other aspect, it felt fresh and original to play, rather than bearing any marked similarity to any of the myriad zombie games we have enjoyed in the past.That is thanks to its adherence to the RPG system, which forces you to acquire skills (we had a look at the Skills upgrade tree, and it's clear that you can build your character up in whatever specific manner best suits); previous zombie games have more or less focused on ballistic weaponry.Even in the four-player co-op, we came across characters offering side-missions, so the single-player game should have a good open-world feel to it, which is also unique as far as zombie games are concerned. Things bode well for Dead Island; our experience of the game so far suggests that it is worthy of the attention which it initially demanded with that flashy trailer.•Dead Island will be released for Xbox 360, PC and PS3 on 9 September
The rumours about Microsoft wanting to buy a handset maker - first it wasNokia, then it wasn't, then it was - have revved up again. Look here onBloomberg:While Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, RIM's co-chief executive officers, said last week that their commitment to RIM is "stronger than ever," the company may now attract Microsoft and Dell, BMO Harris Private Banking said. A buyer would get a smartphone maker that is still dominant among corporate clients, offers greater security with its own e-mail servers and generates more free cash versus its market value than any of its rivals. Paying $40 a share still values RIM at a discount to comparable companies in the industry.Wow, that's powerful logic - Microsoft has a lock on the corporate business, and look, RIM's market cap has fallen from C$84.3bn in June 2008 to just C$13.3bn today - itslowest value since the iPhone (which disrupted the entire smartphone market) was announced. And $40 a share? Why, they're trading at US$28 - we're in the money!However it's also complete nonsense. Why would Microsoftsign a deal with Nokiawhich will cost it billions and in which it will swap skills back and forth, in one of the closest alliances it has ever had in mobile, if it were going to buy a handset maker? And guess what - Microsoft already owns a handset maker. Has everyone forgotten thatMicrosoft bought Dangerin 2008, and went as far as producing phones (thenot-lamented Kin) as a result?Microsoft already has those skills in-house. And sure, buying RIM could splurge a few more of those billion that have been burning a hole in its bank account. Except that Microsoft is a software house, and it's putting its bets on software like Skype and Windows Phone, and buying RIM would be what stockbrokers call "catching a falling knife" - ie trying to grab it on the way down. Steve Ballmer is a good dealmaker. He wouldn't go after that deal.As for Dell - true, it's a hardware company, but it's attached to Android in phones, and taking over RIM would be fraught; with all the problems inside RIM (such as trying to change platforms while itsexisting BB6 platform is smouldering, why would it want the hassle? Also the price would probably push it into a cash-and-shares (or shares-and-debt) purchase, which wouldn't be good. And the maxim about falling knives applies there too.So why on earth is this being floated as an idea by a stockbrokerage?"Given how significant the deterioration of the stock price has been, that alone will cause interest," said Paul Taylor, who oversees $14.5 billion, including RIM shares, as chief investment officer at BMO Harris in Toronto. "RIM still has meaningful market share in the U.S. and meaningful market share internationally, and RIM has an iconic brand."Or, to ask the question a different way: what reasons could there possibly be for a stockbroker that has seen its holdings in RIM fall by 33% in the past two months to make the suggestion that there might be an acquisition on the way at a 50% premium on the current RIM stock price, which would tend to make people head back into the market to buy RIM shares (pushing the price up) before the acquisition begins?We're sure we can't think of any.
Britain's top policeman has described online attacks by the computer hacking group LulzSec as "extraordinarily significant and deeply worrying" following the arrest of an Essex teenager believed to have been a "significant" figure in the escalating cyberwar.The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, on Wednesday described the arrest of Ryan Cleary, 19, as "very significant".The teenager wasarrested at his family home in Wickford, Essexon Tuesday as part of an international attempt to tighten the net around the hacker group LulzSec.LulzSec have attacked the websites of the CIA, the US senate, US broadcasters and, on Monday, the day of Cleary's arrest, the hackers bought down the website of Britain's Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca).Stephenson declined to comment on the details of Cleary's arrest, but said: "It's a very significant arrest."He added: "The challenges around cyber crime are extraordinarily significant and deeply worrying."Sources close to LulzSec said Cleary, who is still being held for questioning at a central London police station, is "well known" on the internet messageboards where the group co-ordinate attacks, but claimed that he was not actively involved in assaults on other websites.According to one source, Cleary was "just the host" of an internet chatroom – known as internet relay chat (IRC) – used by the group. "No way is he capable of pulling off what LulzSec are doing," the source added.Clearly becomes the sixth British person to be arrested in connection with the recent spate of attacks on websites. Five people, aged 15 to 26, were arrested and had their computers and mobile phones seized in January on suspicion of being involved in the notorious hacking group Anonymous. The Guardian understands that none of the suspects have yet been charged.Earlier this month, LulzSec declared its intention to break into government websites and leak confidential documents. Yesterday it dismissed claims it had staged an attack on the British census.The information commissioner's office, which investigates data breaches such as the one claimed on the British census, said it had been in contact with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) about the claims, but that it had not yet been passed evidence of any breach. The ONS said it was still investigating.
It started, and ended, with a click. With one touch of a mouse, a hacker managed to transfer 25,000 credits of online currency – then worth almost $500,000 dollars – to his own account. The transfer is visible on a public register; the original owner has publicised his plight online, but to no avail – the money is gone.This hack, which happened in June 2011, was the first major online heist forBitcoins, one of the world's newest currencies, and the subsequent panic left many casual users reeling.Days later, it was dwarfed by hack number two: an attack on the currency's biggest online exchange, involving more than 400,000 Bitcoins – worth almost $9m (£5.5m). The attempt to sell off the coins was a sale so huge it plunged the value of each coin from more than $17 to $0.01.The exchange, MtGox, was promptly taken offline, and is planning to reverse the transactions. No-one knows what the currency will be worth – if anything – when it reopens.Such is the strange world of the online frontier. Bitcoin isn't the currency of an online game or Facebook fad – it's one of the first attempts to create a real-world currency with no governments, no central banks, and no rules. More than 6,500,000 Bitcoins are in circulation, in an online economy, which was worth over $180m shortly before June's hack.No bank or government issues new Bitcoins. Instead, they are "mined" in batches of 50 as a result of intensive calculations carried out on PCs across the world. Anyone wanting to mine the coins installs mining software, which carries out intensive calculations on a certain unit of "work".Whichever computer around the world solves the problem receives 50 Bitcoins. Six months ago, this reward was worth less than $1. At the start of June 2011, it was worth $1,000. The work generally needs powerful computers to pay off: some developers involved with the project estimate a typical laptop could work for two years without ever generating any coins.Given the rocketing value of the coins – and the increasing difficulty of mining them – it's no surprise people have started going to extraordinary lengths to generate them.Users on mining forums discuss cooling their computers in dry ice to allow the processors to run faster, customising specialist chips, or borrowing networked computing power to generate more coins. One even reported the upturn in his electricity use was so significant his house was raided by police, who were concerned that he might be farming cannabis.Members of the hacking collectives LulzSec and Anonymous, behind many of the high-profile hacks of recent weeks, may have found a more innovative solution: using other people's computers.The groups' famed distributed denial-of-service attacks rely on botnets – networks of computers to which hackers have gained access, usually without the owners' knowledge – to provide the weight of numbers to take down high profile targets.Several purported members of Anonymous, plus intermediaries linked to Anon and to Lulzsec, have confirmed some individuals connected to the organisations have used their botnets to "mine" Bitcoins.Credible reports suggest some individuals connected to Anonymous have botnets with more than 100,000 active computers. A network of this size, even mining Bitcoins inefficiently, has the potential to generate 400 to 500 coins a day – worth in excess of $7,500 before the crash.Coders in the Bitcoins community are divided by the involvement of the hacking collectives in their community. While some deny any botnet mining occurs, others concede it's a factor, and admit a slump in processing power data in April signified a botnet being turned off. One, who preferred not to be named, acknowledged it was "neat that those guys decided they could get a better return from participating in Bitcoins than by attacking it".The attractions of Bitcoins to such communities are manifold. It's an online-only experiment with no government or corporate involvement. It's accepted as currency on hundreds of sites worldwide, including one claiming to sell illegal drugs and several selling pornography.It is also, despite having a public register of all transactions, capable of being totally anonymous. Users taking other precautions will find the only occasion at which they might link their Bitcoins wallet to their real identity is when transferring their coins into real cash at privately owned exchanges.Given these can base themselves anywhere in the world, and often reject regulation, law enforcement agencies have a problem – if the Bitcoins experiment survives, criminals and money-launderers may soon have a near-untraceable channel through which to funnel their proceeds.Perhaps as troubling to some agencies is WikiLeaks' recent decision to embrace the new currency, giving its donors the prospect of anonymity as secure as the site claims its whistleblowers enjoy.Such prospects trouble those driving the development of the currency far less; instead, the majority see the benefits of an unfettered currency as outweighing the costs."The freedom to easily, instantly, and at very low cost pay anybody in the world is the fundamental idea," says Gavin Andresen, described as Bitcoin technical lead. "The internet gives us the ability to communicate with anybody in the world easily, instantly, and at very low cost; I think it should be as easy to pay somebody across the world as it is to send them an email."Another, Nils Schneider, puts it more succinctly: "Bitcoin is an experiment to make a 'raw' digital currency. Such a currency does not need supervision."Schneider also lacked sympathy for the victim of the 25,000 Bitcoin theft which first brought security jitters to the fledgling community. Bitcoin wallets at present are stored with no encryption whatsoever by default, and transfers of stolen material are irreversible unless half of all Bitcoin users agree to it.The change in price when the Bitcoins hit the market after the hack. Source: MtGoxAsked – before the MtGox hack – about the situation, Schneider said: "We're working on adding encryption to the wallet so it can't be stolen that easily again. But other than that, Bitcoin is like cash. You have to secure it yourself and shouldn't keep too many Bitcoins on an easily hackable computer."He added that should the currency take off, he hoped banks would emerge to aid people in securing their wallets.Perhaps the simplest explanation for what brought thousands of users – many non-technical – to an unprotected currency is the sheer increase in value it attained in recent months. On 1 January 2011, Bitcoins were worth 30 cents each. By 9 June 2011, they were worth $29.55.The total volume of US dollar to Bitcoins traded on MtGox was $146,000 in January. In the first two weeks of June alone, this was 143 times bigger, at $21m worth of trades.Bitcoins have been generating value from nothing, and breaking the economic rules of virtually every currency. By design, Bitcoins at present have an inflation rate estimated by one developer at 7,200% (this will automatically drop to 0% over the next 30 years).Such hyperinflation usually causes the exchange rate of a currency to plummet – as happened to Germany in the early 1930s, or Zimbabwe over the past decade. Bitcoins' value instead increased almost a hundredfold in six months.Even those most centrally involved in Bitcoins agree that prior to the MtGox hack Bitcoin was in a bubble – and that a loss of trust could be fatal: "The growth rate is certainly not sustainable. I don't know if the current value with respect to established currencies is sustainable or not; certainly if people lost trust in the Bitcoin system its value would crash," says Andresen."Bitcoin is an experiment that has never been tried before. People should think of it as an internet startup – it might be wildly successful, or it might fail. In any case, I do not expect that the road ahead will be smooth: even if Bitcoin is ultimately successful, I expect more price bubbles, scams, software bugs, failures of Bitcoin-related businesses and other problems that I can't even imagine right now."Given Bitcoin's travails, the more idealistic developers are keen to point out the wider benefits an open currency could have, if it became established. Controversially – within the community at least – some also acknowledge legal oversight may be necessary for these to be realised."People in the third world are at the mercy of corrupt governments and banks," says Amir Taaki, co-founder of Bitcoin Consultancy. "Bitcoin can drastically reduce overheads and fight corruption. At present, it's possible to pay up to 23% commission on an international funds transfer. That's not capitalism, that's a corruption of capitalism."Just days after the massive hack of MtGox brought the fledgling currency to its knees, its idealists awaited its reopening to see if a currency without rules, government, or corporate control could withstand its first crash to survive long enough to deliver any of its potential benefits.The wealthiest Bitcoin users have more pressing concerns. It's only when the exchange reopens that they'll learn if their electronic wallets are worth millions of dollars, or less than the $10 USB stick on which they're stored. It's a tense wait.
British mobile entertainment firm Shazam has raised $32 million in a funding round led by Silicon Valley venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Institutional Venture Partners, with existing investor DN Capital also chipping in.The funding will fuel Shazam's expansion beyond its original music focus to TV show and advertisement tagging, particularly in the US, where the company has been working with a number of broadcasters in the last year.The news comes as Shazam prepares to sign up its 150 millionth user for its service, and cements its position as one of the few UK mobile startups to have secured several rounds of funding from prominent US venture capital firms."We're profitable, but this is an opportunity to invest and grow even faster, investing in Shazam for TV and the core music proposition as we grow it from 150 million users to a quarter of a billion," said executive vice president of marketing David Jones in an interview."The investment will fuel both sides of the business. The core music side is our bread and butter, and the reason we're growing by 1.2 million new users a week. But with that reach, it's a natural extension to start Shazamming television shows and the ads around them."Shazam's approach to these two separate entertainment markets is slightly different. For music, the company built its own database of songs – currently 11 million strong – to enable users of its app to identify tracks playing in the real world, and then buy them or access related content.For TV, the company is not currently trying to build a comparable database of all shows, choosing instead to work with US television firms on a more cherry-picking basis. The app works in the same way: when a supported show is being watched, the viewer can tag it using Shazam's app – not to find out what it is, but to access more content related to it."We are working with the major networks and show creators to Shazam-enable specific television shows, and then making sure they provide a rich, satisfying experience for viewers," said Jones. "We're getting some of that extra bonus content that they can't squeeze into the main show, and bringing it to the second screen."An example is Bravo talent show Platinum Hit, where viewers using Shazam can watch the full judges deliberations and full performances from the contestants on their smartphones.The app thus taps into the current enthusiasm from the broadcast industry for second-screen interactivity – an area also being investigated by startups like GetGlue and Miso, as well as through broadcasters' own applications."There are some TV check-in apps where you can check in, tweet and post on Facebook, but that's not compelling enough," said Jones."We think our reach is key too: nearly 150 million people have Shazam on their mobile phones. While some show creators and networks are building dedicated apps for each show, they're finding that it's pretty difficult to drive installs and regular usage for those apps. Consumers don't necessarily want a separate app on their phone for every show that they watch."Jones says Shazam is making "pretty sizeable revenues" from its partnerships with brands to integrate Shazam into their TV advertisements in the US, and suggests that the app is providing the kind of interactivity once promised by red-button interactive TV ads, which have not gained any traction in the US.For now, Shazam's TV efforts remain focused on the US, although Jones says the company will "definitely" be expanding to other markets, including the UK and Europe, once it has proved its model on the other side of the Atlantic.The $32 million funding round will be crucial in meeting demand from US broadcasters to work with Shazam, rather than leave them to seek partnerships with other companies. The company is having to rapidly increase the headcount for its teams working on the TV tagging campaigns, with Jones saying this will be reflected in an expansion of the number of shows supported throughout the summer and autumn.What does this mean for Shazam's original music business, though? The company has continued to add new features to its app on that front, including asocial feed of friends' tagsand, more recently, a LyricPlay option to see the words to songs in real-time as they are tagged. There is a valid question about how long one app can cater to music and TV tagging, though: might Shazam need to split into two apps at some point?"It is one app today and that is working quite effectively," said Jones. "We will keep our options open as things progress, but we think we can present the different experiences [music and TV] within the same app. In the short to medium term, you'll see all of that in the same app, and probably in the long term too."

Not a word from Yahoo for months, and lots of interesting snippets come along at once.• First: The mood at Yahoo is still pretty bleak despite Carol Bartz' much-reported turnaround plan, which seems to have underwhelmed investors. TechCrunch describes this as a "360-degree turnaround" plan, which rather beautifully describes a lot of activity but no real progress. Anticipating this week's shareholder meeting, several executive changes are either anticipated or hoped for.Chairman Roy Bostock might face a challenge, andPrabhakar Raghavan, who we profiled in April, has been the subject of concern in his new role of chief strategy officer because of his lack of business experience.But there are also rumours thateven chief executive Carol Bartz herself could be shunted out, with Fox Digital's Jon Miller, board member David Kenny, Softback chief Masayoshi Son or Alibaba founder Jack Ma mooted as replacements.Replacing Bartz might comfort some agitated shareholders in the long run, but would yet another new turnaround scheme and some more new faces really help the company? For now, shareholders are more likely to "send a signal" by replacing Bostock, perhaps.• Second: TheLA Timesreported that Yahoo recently made an unsolicited offer for Hulu, the online TV service whose future had been in some doubt. Co-owners Disney, News Corporation and Comcast launched the new paid subscription service Hulu Plus late last year in an effort to boost revenues from the site, but reportedly abandoned plans to go public because they couldn't secure long-term content deals. Chief executiveJason Kilar bloggedtwo months ago that Hulu will generate $500m in revenue this year from 1 million subscribers and will have earned $300m for content producers.TechCrunchcites a source who says Yahoo never had "meaningful conversations", but whether it was Yahoo or another interested party, one source said that Hulu had been prompted to look at the possibilities for a sale and has recruited Morgan Stanley to negotiate.Photo byYodel Anecdotalon Flickr.Some rights reservedGivenRoss Levinsohn's commentsthis week about Yahoo's "priority" of becoming more like a media company, Hulu would be a sensible fit. The head of media, advertising sales and partnerships told the FT that previous chief executive Terry Semel was right to focus Yahoo on media content, but was just too early. Now with demand and growth in video advertising, it makes sense – if it isn't too late to turn Yahoo round.And a deal with Hulu might mean we get something call Huluyahoo, which is quite possibly Hawaiian for "last ditch effort to save our once glorious internet company".But it seems increasingly likely that Yahoo is sliding towards breaking up to make maximum value for its investors rather than committing to a long-term vision for the future, despite going through those motions. The consensus is that Flickr will be sold off along with Yahoo's valuable interests in Asia, including its stake in Alibaba. WhetherYahoo survivesas a consumer brand at all, we'll have to wait and see.
Should mobile app developers be putting more effort into porting their apps to Symbian smartphones? There's a large existing install base, and while Nokia is planning to phase out the OS over the next couple of years, the company claims it will sell another 150 million Symbian devices during that time.New figures released by industry body the GSMA tell another story, however. According to its Mobile Media Metrics report, compiled together with comScore, Symbian accounted for just 1% of connected application users in the UK in April.Apple's iOS took a 65% share, with Android accounting for 31%, and other platforms (BlackBerry,  Windows Mobile/Phone, webOS and feature phones) taking a 3% share.The analysis is based on the same principles as the research wereported on last week: comScore's data is based on apps that connect to the Internet over an operator network, so they don't include non-connected downloadable games. In other words, Symbian users who are downloading and playing games on their phones won't be counted for the purposes of this survey.comScore provided Apps Blog with some separate figures from its MobiLens research, showing device market share for smartphones in the UK in April. According to those figures, 27.6% of smartphone users were on iPhone that month, 24.7% on Android, 23.6% on Symbian, 18.1% on BlackBerry and 3.8% on Windows Mobile or Windows Phone 7 devices.Compare the two pieces of research, and you see iPhone is hugely over-indexing in terms of connected app usage, Android is doing pretty well, but Symbian – 23.6% of active smartphones but a mere 1% of connected app users – hardly presents an appealing prospect to developers making those connected apps.Caveats? Just a few. The figures don't tell us much about the addressable market in the UK for people using non-connected apps. They don't tell us anything about countries elsewhere in the world where Symbian may be a more viable platform for these applications.Meanwhile, we're puzzled at the poor share for BlackBerry given the popularity of mail and BBM messaging on RIM's devices – we suspect that these apps may not be registering with comScore due to the technical details of the BlackBerry platform.Even so, when next wondering why so many developers appear to have iOS tunnel vision, the Mobile Media Metrics figures for the UK provide valuable context. To put it bluntly, according to these stats, there are more than 5.7 million iPhone owners using connected apps in the UK, versus 2.7 million Android users and 119,000 Symbian users.It's not just about how many devices have been sold, but about how many of those people are actively downloading and using apps. And how many are willing topayfor them, of course, but that's another piece of research in the making.

Over 50 percent of respondents are firmly in favor of the 10″ screen, which leads us to conclude that the 7″ tablet models recently launched, like the BlackBerry PlayBook, are destined for failure. Consumer's preference for the 10″ form factor explains the lukewarm response to Samsung's 7″ Galaxy tablet and the rapid introduction of larger screen models in that series."People were surveyed in the US and UK: 50% said they would choose Apple for their tablet in each.

Investigators believe a teenager arrested at his family home in Essex may have been a "significant" figure in a computer hacking group alleged to have staged attacks against websites belonging to the US government, the electronics giant Sony, and an elite British crime unit.Scotland Yard cybercrime detectives were questioning Ryan Cleary, 19, over the attacks carried out by the LulzSec group, which mostly targeted websites belonging to institutions and companies in the US.The events leading to the arrest of Cleary involved an investigation by British police and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI's involvement, plus the nature of the targets, raised the prospect that Washington may seek the teenager's extradition to the US, just as it did in the case of UFO obsessive Gary McKinnon, a saga that is still ongoing.LulzSec have attacked the websites of the CIA, the US senate, US broadcasters and, on Monday, the day of Cleary's arrest, the hackers bought down the website of Britain's Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca).LulzSec is believed to have established itself as a formidable splinter group to Anonymous, the hacking group embroiled in the WikiLeaks fallout, with high-profile attacks on the Gawker website in December last year and a devastating assault on the US security firm HBGary in February.Members of Anonymous claimed in emails to the Guardian that Cleary, though involved, was not the "mastermind" behind any hacking group. "He owned the server which LulzSec used to communicate using IRC [internet relay chat, a bit like instant messenger]."UK records show that a company called Arcusvoice, which held domain names used to host websites, was registered to Cleary's home address in Wickford, Essex."Ryan Cleary was not a mastermind hacker," the email continued. "He could not keep his own personal information safe. He simply provided the means of communication, just like if two people send letters to each other, FedEx/Royal Mail/DHL are the providers of communication."Cleary's brother, 22-year-old Mitchell, said: "He's not the sort of person to do anything mad or go out and let his hair down or do anything violent. He stays in his room – you'll be lucky if he opens the blinds, but that's just family, isn't it? I barely see him – I'm more of a football person – he's more of an inside person."Mitchell said his brother had fallen out with people over WikiLeaks: "He used to be part of WikiLeaks and he has upset someone from doing that and they have made a Facebook page having a go at him."James Rounce, a neighbour of Cleary, said: "They moved in about 10&nbsp;years ago and have been pleasant neighbours. I&nbsp;think he had been away at university and had come back for the holidays or because he had finished his exams. You could tell he was very bright just from the way he spoke and presented himself."LulzSec staged two types of attacks. One was hacking into websites, the other was effectively blocking a website from being used, called a denial of service.As recently as May, the group attacked websites belonging to broadcasters, including Fox and the US public service broadcaster, PBS. LulzSec also claimed credit for an attack on the US X Factor website, which experts believe indicates the relatively young average age of the&nbsp;group.Earlier this month, LulzSec declared its intention to break into government websites and leak confidential documents. Yesterday it dismissed claims it had staged an attack on the British census.According to security experts, it is a small and close-knit team – although they probably do not operate in the same country or even time zone. The security firm Imperva believes there are just eight members, including one who orchestrated the attack on the US security company HBGary, and another who can call on the resources of a "botnet" of virus-infected PCs to attack any website on the net.Researcher Rik Ferguson of security software firm Trend Micro said "it seems to be a tight-knit group – they don't let people join them, they just take suggestions from people of what to target for a hack next."
The group behind LulzSec has never made its intentions clear – apart from awebsitewhich proclaims that "we have now taken it upon ourselves to spread fun, fun, fun, throughout the entire calender [sic] year."However Tal Be'ery, lead web researcher atImperva, has put together a profile of LulzSec based on their own work, plus some information that is publicly available.• LulzSec seems to be a spin-off of a group of hackers from the "Anonymous" organisation.• Theyhacked HBgaryandGawkerunder the umbrella of the Anonymous group, but then decided to create their own "gig". Why? Probably to be independent.• The supporting evidence for that is that the same nicks [nicknames] are used on both anonymous hacking-related discussions (early 2011) and LulzSec (mid 2011).• They communicate mainly via private IRC channels – and publish viaTwitterandPastebin.• They mostly use web application vulnerabilities: they usedSQL injectiontohack PBSand (one of) the Sony hacks (against Sony Pictures).• They also use automated tools to harvest databases, calledHavij, as we can see from the leaked PBS hack screenshots.The group is small – less than 10 or so. (This is confirmed separately by security researcher Rik Ferguson of Trend Micro, who comments that "it seems to be a tight-knit group – it only needs to be a few people, since all they need is a Twitter account and a web page. There's no evidence that they're a particularly sophisticated group.)The members, according to Imperva:• "Sabu" – HBgary hacker. Seems to be the leader.• "Nakomis" – Coder, rumoured to be one of coders of the PHPBB bulletin board.• "Topiary" – handles finance, such as donations and payment for services (eg botnets)• "Tflow" – Hacker. (Rumoured.)• "Kayla" – Hacker. Owns a bigbotnet.• "Joepie91" – Website admin.• "Avunit" - No more detail.From hacker discussion forums, it seems they might get arrested as soon as many "real world" details on their identities get revealed, suggests Tal Be'ery.
The international hunt for hackers believed to have staged high-profile attacks on websites ranging from law enforcement bodies to Sony has led to the arrest of a teenager based in Essex, police say.The hackers known as LulzSec claim to have been behind attacks on websites around the world, including the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the US Senate and the CIA, as well as the games firms Nintendo and Sony.British police said intelligence led them to arrest the 19-year-old at a home in Wickford, Essex, over the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.The teenager is Ryan Cleary, who lived at his family home. Investigators believe the arrest is significant and linked to the attacks based mainly at websites belonging to US institutions and organisations.The operation involved two British forces as well as the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).The police said they believed the attacks were linked and were carried out by the same group of hackers.The teenager was being questioned at a London police station while specialist officers examined computer equipment seized from the address he was arrested at.The Metropolitan police said: "Officers from the Metropolitan police central e-crime unit (PCeU) have arrested a 19-year-old man in a pre-planned intelligence-led operation."The arrest follows an investigation into network intrusions and DDoS attacks against a number of international business and intelligence agencies by what is believed to be the same hacking group."The teenager was arrested on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act and Fraud Act offences and was taken to a central London police station, where he currently remains in custody for questioning."Searches at a residential address in Wickford, Essex, following the arrest last night have led to the examination of a significant amount of material. These forensic examinations remain ongoing."The PCeU was assisted by officers from Essex police and has been working in co-operation with the FBI."On Monday, Soca, the UK national law enforcement unit dubbed the "British FBI", was forced to take its website offline after an apparent attack.The website was still down early on Tuesday but was back in service later in the morning.In a message posted on Twitter on Monday, LulzSec said: "Tango down – soca.gov.uk – in the name of #AntiSec." The group later added: "DDoS is of course our least powerful and most abundant ammunition. Government hacking is taking place right now behind the scenes. #AntiSec."The next day, LulzSec warned again on Twitter of its plans to step up the attacks by hacking into government websites and stealing confidential documents. "Our next step is to categorise and format leaked items we acquire and release them in #AntiSec 'payloads' on our website and The Pirate Bay," the group said.Separately, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday it was investigating claims that the UK census data had been unlawfully accessed, following a message purporting to be from LulzSec.It said: "We are aware of the suggestion that census data has been accessed. We are working with our security advisers and contractors to establish whether there is any substance to this."The 2011 census places the highest priority on maintaining the security of personal data. At this stage we have no evidence to suggest that any such compromise has occurred."A post to the @LulzSec Twitter accountlater said: "Not sure we claimed to hack the UK census or where that rumour started."
The hacker group LulzSec has denied hacked the Office for National Statistics or stolen data from the 2011 census, after what appeared to be a statement from the group appeared on the site Pastebin.Security experts are sceptical of claims that appeared on Pastebin, which is frequently used by hacker groups to make "announcements" of attacks against sites or organisations.Theclaim on Pastebinappeared mid-morning on Tuesday, saying "We have blissfully obtained records of every single citizen who gave their records to the security-illiterate UK government for the 2011 census. We're keeping them under lock and key though... so don't worry about your privacy (...until we finish re-formatting them for release). Myself and the rest of my Lulz shipmates will then embark upon a trip to ThePirateBay with our beautiful records for your viewing pleasure!"But Rik Ferguson of the security specialists Trend Micro pointed out that it is simple to put content onto Pastebin – and that the content of previous LulzSec releases is already there. "Anybody can paste anything on Pastebin," he said. "It's easy to copy and paste the format of previous releases." Some of the details in the claim seemed to refer back to much older releases.LulzSec itself denied the claim on its Twitter feed, which has been the only reliable source of information about its claimed exploits since it first came to public notice in May by hacking thecontestant database for the US version of X-Factor."Just saw the pastebin of the UK census hack. That wasn't us – don't believe fake LulzSec releases unless we put out a tweet first," said the first. A second added, "Anyone in the world can copy and paste The Lulz Boat ASCII art and general lighthearted theme. Smarten up, check the [Twitter] feed first."The two tweets were later deleted, althoughThe tweets vanished for a while, though readers did capturescreenshots of themfirst. They have now been restored.The Office for National Statistics said it was "investigating" the claims that were made. Suspicions had been raised about the possibility of the hack because the census data was collected by the US military and civil contractor Lockheed Martin, which recently announced that it had been the victim of a concerted hacking attack. It is not clear however whether the census data would have been accessible via Lockheed Martin's systems in the US, nor whether the data would have left the UK in the first place.Corrected: the LulzSec tweets did not appear for some time but reappeared on its Twitter stream.
BT and TalkTalk have been refused permission to appeal against their failed legal challenge of the Digital Economy Act.Britain's two largest internet providers werelooking to overturn a high court judicial reviewof the controversial legislation at the court of appeal.However, Judge Sir Richard Buxton on Monday refused the application at the high court in London.The ruling effectively ends the two ISPs' long-running battle against the act, a central plank of government plans to curb illicit filesharing.Government plans to send thousands of warning letters to alleged illegal downloaders – a measure introduced by the act – are set to begin in the first half of next year.BT and TalkTalklost a judicial reviewof the act in April, but vowed then to continue their legal challenge.The ISPs believe the act infringes internet users' "basic rights and freedoms", and that it did not receive sufficient parliamentary scrutiny when it was"rushed through"in the dying days of the previous government in April 2010.The companies argued that the judicial review conclusions on "many of the important and complex issues" were "not robust enough".BT and TalkTalk appealed against four of the five grounds of the judicial review, arguing that the act is broadly "inconsistent with European law". Both companies have raised concerns about how the legislation works alongside European Union directives on technical standards, authorisation, e-commerce, as well as privacy and electronic communications.Mr Justice Parker, the high court judge who threw out BT and TalkTalk's judicial review of the act last month, rejected the companies' initial appeal against the ruling earlier this month.Separately, BT and TalkTalk have been ordered to pay 93% of the government's legal fees from the judicial review of the act, understood to be about £100,000.The legislation will have cost rights holders, Ofcom and interner providers almost £6m by the time it is implemented next year, according tofigures released under the Freedom of Information Act last week.A spokesman for the two companies said: "We are now considering our position."We still believe that the Digital Economy Act measures aimed at preventing online copyright infringement are inconsistent with European law. Following the decision of Lord Justice Buxton earlier this week we have asked the Court of Appeal for an oral hearing of our application for permission to appeal."
The Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the UK national law enforcement unit dubbed the 'British FBI', has been forced to takeits websiteoffline after an attack by the computer hacking group, LulzSec.Soca took down its website late on Monday after it was targeted with a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack by the notorious internet group. The website was still down early on Tuesday but was back in service later in the morning.It is thought to be the first time a British law enforcement website has been crippled by the group, which has previously attacked sites belonging to the US Senate, the CIA, as well as the games firms Nintendo and Sony.In a message posted on Twitter on Monday, LulzSecsaid: "Tango down – soca.gov.uk – in the name of #AntiSec." The group lateradded: "DDoS is of course our least powerful and most abundant ammunition. Government hacking is taking place right now behind the scenes. #AntiSec."Early on Tuesday, LulzSec warned that it would step up the attacks by hacking in to government websites and stealing confidential documents. "Our next step is to categorise and format leaked items we acquire and release them in #AntiSec 'payloads' on our website and The Pirate Bay," the groupposted on Twitter.A spokesman for Soca, the government agency that draws on expertise from the police, immigration and revenue and customs to investigate organised crime including drugs and people trafficking, said its website was taken offline to "limit the impact" of the attack.He added: "The Soca website is a source of information for the general public which is hosted by an external provider. It is not linked to our operational material or the data we hold."Having established itself as aformidable splinter group to Anonymous, the hacking group embroiled in the WikiLeaks fallout, LulzSec has recently declared its intention to break into government websites and leak confidential documents. "Prime targets are banks and other high-ranking establishments," the group has said.The group initially only targeted US broadcasters, including PBS and Fox, and gaming firms,most notably Sony and Nintendo.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

After the indignity of seeing its economy overtaken by China's earlier this year, Japan has clawed back a little pride, beating its east Asian rival to produce the world's most powerful computer for the first time in seven years.The machine, nicknamed K – a play on the Japanese word kei, meaning 10 quadrillion, the number of operations per second it is designed to perform when it is completed next year – crushed the opposition when the latest rankings were announced at the International Supercomputing conference at Hamburg.It harnesses more power than the next five supercomputers combined, and is mush faster than its closest rival, designed by China's National University of Defence Technology. About 1m desktop computers would have to be linked up to replicate its performance.The K, a collaborative effort involving Fujitsu and Riken, a government-funded research institute, boasts a current speed of 8.16 petaflops – or 8.16 quadrillion operations a second – making it three times faster than China's most powerful machine, the Tianhe-1A, which had topped the rankings since last November.Development of the K was slowed by the natural disaster that struck Japan's north-east coast in March; appropriately enough, when fully functional the supercomputer will be put to use predicting the possible impact of earthquakes and tsunamis.It will also have economic uses in the fields of drugs, new technology and renewable energy, and could be used to improve our understanding of climate change."We must realise that science and technology is an area in which Japan can show its strength," Riken's president, Ryoji Noyori, told reporters.While Japan's resurgence should have scientists dancing in laboratory corridors, not everyone is convinced that resources should be poured into fueling the country's supercomputer rivalry with the US and, increasingly, China.Funding for the project, estimated at 112bn yen, was almost cut in 2009 when a government panel questioned the investment required in the midst of an economic crisis. Renho, now the government minister in charge of cutting wasteful spending, infuriated scientists when she asked: "What's wrong with being number two?"Its future was secured after a group of Nobel prize winners convinced the prime minister at the time, Yukio Hatoyama, that Japan should not settle for second best.Asked to comment on this week's success, Renho said: "That's good news. I want to salute the people involved."The K computer, with more than 68,544 processors, occupies 672 cabinets at Riken's Advanced Institute for Computational Science in the western port city of Kobe. It uses at 9.9 megawatts of power, running up an electricity bill of about $10m (£6.16m) a year — that's enough electricity to power about 10,000 homes a year.It is more than 200 times faster than the Earth Simulator, a joint project involving NEC and the Japan Agency for Marine-earth Science and Technology, the last Japanese supercomputer to top the global league table, in 2004.Japan's celebrations may not last for long, however. The US technology firm IBM is working on a system at Illinois University that will be able to process more than 10 quadrillion calculations per second.

In June 2010, the average US mobile user spent 43 minutes a day using apps. In June 2011, that has increased to 81 minutes.That is the key finding from a new piece of research by mobile analytics firm Flurry, based on data from iPhone, BlackBerry, Windows Phone and Java handset owners.Flurry claims that this means that mobile app usage has now overtaken desktop and mobile web usage in terms of minutes per day per user, citing comScore and Alexa statistics to show this is 74 minutes for web usage."This growth has come primarily from more sessions per user, per day rather than a large growth in average session lengths," explains the company in itsblog post. "Time spent on the Internet has grown at a much slower rate, 16% over the last year, with users now spending 74 minutes on the Internet a day."Flurry has also broken down the time spent per app category, revealing that 47% of app usage is gaming and 32% social networking, followed by news (9%), entertainment (7%) and other apps (5%)."As we drill down into the data, consumers use these two categories more frequently, and for longer average session lengths, compared to other categories," explains Flurry. "Any way we slice it, Games and Social Networking apps deliver the most engaging experience on mobile today."The company puts its research in the context of this month's rumours aboutFacebook's Project Spartan, which is expected to bring the social network's platform for games and other applications to the mobile web, and possibly to its native mobile apps.Facebook's apps are already hugely popular on mobile, but its presence in mobile gaming is currently focused purely on use of its Facebook Connect API. Flurry thinks its stats show why Project Spartan will look to do more, and the company may well be right.Flurry's figures are for US mobile users only.
Phew, that's Monday over with – things can only get better.
Nokia has launched a new smartphone, the N9, which uses its own Meego software, while chief executive Stephen Elop said he has "increased confidence" that the struggling Finnish mobile phone maker will launch its first Windows Phone device this year and ship in volume in 2012."Our primary smartphone strategy is to focus on the Windows phone," Elop, who moved to Nokia from Microsoft last year, said at a telecom conference in Singapore. However he provided few details on how he planned to arrest a slide in Nokia's market share.The N9 is the first – and last – smartphone from Nokia to run Meego. The commercial launch will be held later this year, the company said. The N9 model comes with a large touch screen and is available in black, cyan and magenta. The MeeGo platform - a newcomer in the market dominated by Google and Apple – was born in February 2010 when Nokia and Intel unveiled a merger of Nokia's Linux Maemo software platform with Intel's Moblin, which is also based on Linux open-source software. After Nokia pulled back from the project four months ago other vendors have become more interested in the technology as Nokia's dominant role in the project had held back others from adopting it.Last month, Nokia said it decided to abandon hopes of meeting key targets just weeks after setting them, raising questions over whether Elop can deliver on a turnaround he promised in February.Nokia has been losing ground in the smartphone market to Apple's iPhone and Google's Android devices, and in the low-end mobile phones to more nimble Asian rivals such as China's ZTE and India's Micromax.In a research note this month, NomurasaidSamsung Electronics will become the world's largest smartphone maker by volume this quarter and that the number of iPhones sold will mean Apple will take the number two spot next quarter, pushing Nokia to the third place.Nokia has led the smartphone market since 1996 when it launched the Communicator, a smartphone that is popular in the business community for its ability to browse the internet as well as to receive and send emails, data and fax.Nokia dumped plans to use MeeGo in its future smartphones when in February it picked Microsoft's Windows Phone as its future software choice, but it decided to unveil one of the models it was working on before closing the business line.The partnership with Windows may not be a panacea for Nokia's troubles since rivals including HTC and ZTE will continue to bring out devices based on Microsoft's software.Nokia's market value has plunged by more than half since February, after the leak of a memo from Elop that compared the company's market position to a man standing on a burning oil platform.
Japanese artist Takashi Murakami has been commissioned by Google to produce the latest in its series of Google doodles.The multicoloured cartoon, titled The First Day of Summer, entwines flowery bursts around gaping mouthed heads characteristic of the Japanese anime style.The doodle represents the date of the summer solstice, much loved by druids, but the doodle's title is somewhat misleading – the solstice is the longest day in summer, rather than the first, although it may give new hope to those deluged in recent days and those heading to the Glastonbury festival this weekend.Murakami's work is usually known for its appropriation of high art forms such as sculpture, which he then melds with low art themes from pop culture to mass media. He has produced a variety of contemporary work from 30ft sculptures to his so-called superflat paintings, in which he combines flat graphic imagery and colours to create highly patterned images.Murakami has also carried out more commercial endeavours including a close collaboration with fashion designer Marc Jacobs, and in 2008 was included in Time magazine's 100 most influential people.So far this month, the Google doodle has commemorated Russia day, the 92nd birthday of Richard Scarry, author of the Busytown series of children's books, and the total lunar eclipse.The summer solstice, which falls on 21 June each year, occurs when the Earth's axial tilt is most inclined towards the sun, creating the longest day in the northern hemisphere.Also known as Midsummer, the solstice has long held spiritual significance for many, some of whom are drawn to sites such as the stone circle at Stonehenge to celebrate. Li, the Chinese goddess of light, also has a festival on the solstice.
There are two Best Ofs currently lined up for your notalgic pleasure, but as I still have around ten hours of E3 interviews to transcribe, here is just one of them – taking us back to May 23-27, as edited by HumofEvil. You may remember this momentous week: LA Noire was out and several Gamesblog regulars had an opinion – but it was another gruesome mystery that most Chatterbox regulars were thinking of. Yes, the whole Imogen Thomas enigma had been solved.But gaming did get a peep in, with Demon's Souls casting its usual shadow over proceedings. It was powerless, though, against snadwiches, hamster deaths and Fifa – the governing body, not the game.Enjoy!Monday, May 23For the start of this new Best Of we must begin with an ending. As the football season draws to a close our thoughts go out to all Gamesblog readers who support Birmingham, Blackpool or West Ham. Well, maybe not Birmingham – even our resident City fan ShadowMind couldn't spare a tear for them"I love Birmingham City, but hate the way they have played this season, negative from the first whistle to the last and it cost us... Deserve to go down, hopefully now we can transform the team.Of course, United were the team on everybody's lips, or one particular United player at least, as blog talk turned to what was possibly the biggest scandal in football for, ooh, a few weeks. I'm pretty sure we're allowed to talk about it now, but just in case (and to save Keef from the withering glare of Charles, should I be wrong), I will not mention the name of the aging Welsh international and Quorn aficionado who was at the centre of it all. However, I can say, "JESUS CHRIST! IT WAS [redacted] WHAT HAD SEX WITH THAT WOMAN!" courtesy of a quote from Uncle3en.Unsurprisingly for a disparate group of people whose only common traits are a liking for computer games and a certain laissez faire attitude to work, opinions of whether any of this was 'right' were mixed. Should the rich be allowed to buy privacy? Do superinjunctions amount to an attack on freedom of speech? Are there any circumstances were they should be allowed? Crucial questions indeed, and the political scientists of the blog weighed in with their thoughts and feelings. Some thought them just another tool of the bourgeoisie, others that they served an important purpose in protecting the private lives of the innocent. We'll go with a comment from SockpuppetPseudonym however, who provided this concise analysis:Injunctions like this are a relic now. They were never designed with the concept of an unregulated form of mass communication in mind.The only other option seems to be that, as RustyJames hopes, [redacted]  manages to shut Twitter down.Far away from the land of superinjunctions however, many 'boxers  were dealing with vice of a very different kind as it seemed most of the blog had come over all James Ellroy at the weekend and were, like EnglishRed, "balls deep" in LA Noire. Well, aside from those waiting to pick it up for 20 quid secondhand in a few weeks (makar and silveryfox, we're looking at you). Of those who had played it, the majority view was mostly positive, and EnglishRed even posted a detailed and thoughtful review of his experiences of the game. Unfortunately, it's too long to post here so we'll just go with  the closing line from HereComesTrebles review:I guess if I had to sum it up in one line, it would be – What a complete and utter waste of effort. 6.5/10But really, it is pretty good.Quote of the DayThis has to go to BeCool, who managed to combine the major themes of the day in one timely reponse to EnglishRed:@LA NoireDoes anyone else think they know who the Bad Man is?Ryan Giggs?TuesdayThe turned into a veritable marathon, a chatterthon if you will. Editorial issues (ahem) meant the Tuesday box turned into the Wednesday box as well. The same themes, just double your money[yeah, sorry about that – Keef].Bloodbowl, LA Noire, Demon's Souls, even a new game of Neptune's Pride…And such utter rarities as '90s Crush Blog' and the (unrelated) 'Which colour of grape is best?' blog. And, no I am glad to say Stu Francis didn't crop up in either. This culminated in 'Best Kids TV Show from when you were young?' blog. English Red's response is not printable. It wasn't a classic day.Where are you going with this people?! What the hell happened to incisive wit, political debate, football banter, relationship advice, even cheese or dice blog? Things didn't improve. Best Van Damme film? Retro drinks? 90s Dance? Seriously? Debating the merits of the Shamen or Altern8? [It's Fortran 5 anyway – Keef]Sagesmith used this as a poor excuse to come clean on his past life as a yoof in Ibiza:"I even danced to a Maxi Priest song. There are photographs. You should, under no circumstances, ever dance to Maxi Priest. Trust me on this one gents."There were only two recurrent themes of any note – is it right to wear socks in bed and the sad news of Serenvikity's pet hamster's death. She mourned on the Monday, announced on the Tuesday, and prompted the following insight from Lazybones:"A hamster experiences everything a quarter of the speed as humans do, so if you walk across a room in three seconds, in hamster time it takes 12 seconds. That's why they look so twitchy."What of the socks?! Don't go there, that's my advice.Fittingly, the last Tuesday post was from DrSmurfsGhost:"This is chatterbox."WednesdayHave you ever done that thing where you run out of clean pants so you spray Lynx on yesterday's pair? Well Wednesday was the Chatterbox equivalent of this. Not for the first time an unforeseen human error meant that there was no 'Box, so the resourceful bloggers resorted to squatting in Tuesday's.Simian kicked things off with a dramatic tale of a pavement cyclist which ended up with a visit to A&amp;E and the afternoon 'shirking' from home.  This led to lots of moaning about cyclists but the following was the icing on the bike chat cake from pdmalcom:"I've been singing the praises of most of the local motorists since we moved up here, much nicer to cycle around here than back in Cumbria.""You don't get shot by taxi drivers for a start," replied thebuat.Despite being less than a week since release day, the talk of LA Noire was already beginning to die down, which is more than can be said of Demon Souls which seems to be more popular than ever. All the following remain standard fare on the Games Blog:Sheep2:"Off to visit Old King Doran to ask him nicely for his weapon."CountGinula:"My last 6 months have been spent immersing myself in this damn game, every single minor detail. I even thought about doing a youtube guide from scratch"HereComesTreble:"But the [first baddie with the blue eyes] kills you before you have time to do anything. I think I'm playing a different version than you guys. It's a lot more unforgiving."In a bizarre dearth of quality content we found ourselves talking about the only thing never to have been discussed before. Collar size! This moved on to the ugly sisters of chat, height blog and weight blog. The only silver lining was Lazybone's comment (which turned out to be a lie):"Too fat ....I fell over in the bathroom the other day and got caught between the toilet and the wall."I can't introduce the following quote from Catzilla about trophy whoring because just typing it out makes me feel nauseous but I felt that it should be recorded for posterity:"Find a medium sized par three, say around 150/160 yards, that matches the 100% power of one of your clubs. Then create your own course with nothing but that par three for the holes. As long as you have 100% course mastery and set the pins to easy then your caddie will be basically suggesting straight at the flag shots every time"Quote of the day"Cunning, you're like one of the kids from the animated D&amp;D's. Lost in a never ending world of board games."SirGiggidyMMVII dealing out some bitter home truths."Not to sound too much like me, but Dungeons and Dragons is a role playing game not a board game."Cunningstunt dealing with it all with grace.ThursdaySandwich BlogThe Box once again reached the heights of discussion, answering the age old question "What to put in my sandwich". All bases were cover from Bread "thick wholemeal" (Limni) to spread "Unsalted butter is vile tasteless shite." (Cunningstunt) before things descended into madness. "I heard a good idea on the radio the other day&lt;" claimed Worldsworst. "A guy was on saying that he makes his packed lunch sandwiches with frozen bread. It keeps the ingredients of the sandwich cool and fresh, and it thaws out perfectly by lunchtime. Genius." I think the response to this was summed up by Fegbar:"This sounds shit, to be frank. The bread would drip water all over your filling as it defrosted. And nobody likes a damp sandwich."Other avenues covered included the addition of crisps to a sandwich. "What about a base layer of Walkers smokey bacon flavour, topped with pickled onion Monster Munch? It'd be like a flavour party in your mouth," theorised Limni. As for choice of condiment: "I prefer a good horseradish sauce to butter on the whole," claimed Cunningstunt. I think we can all agree this was an important topic well covered. Now, where are my sandwiches?[Have you had the 'what do you call bread rolls where you come from?' blog? Baps? Cobs? Batches? Why am I getting involved in this? – Keef]FridayAs the week staggered to its close, the Box seemed to lack focus. No unifying theme emerged... Even diceblog was nipped in the bud by Riad offering some unusually cogent analysis on a hoary old subject ("People are very bad at perception when it comes to random things. Uniform random distributions tend to produce clumpy distributions, which people then perceive as structure.")This was the pattern for the whole day. Second rate subjects for discussion were proposed and quickly dispensed with. Top Five Wembley Moments? "You are wrong" (Sheep2) Cost of suncream? "You buy mini figurines as a hobby, then paint them and do pretend fights. £10 on some protective sun block should not be a problem." (Countginula). A certain ennui seemed to have overcome most of us.Early doors, the only man who was prepared to put his neck on the line for his beliefs was Timthemonkey, with his brave proposals to reclaim European Football from the money men. "All football past League 1 is driven not by the love of the game but, the pursuit of more money," he said with incredible insight. Given the shambles FIFA is in at the moment, his evil plan may come to fruition. Not that Simian cared, he'd got a freebie ticket to the Big Cup final and not even July's incoming Bribery Act could dent his good mood ("Good job it's May then.")As the day wore on, the Guardian's declaration that "Team Adele" were the most influential group of bloodsuckers in music exercised HumOfEvil's wrath, Crispycrumb decided to exacerbate the situation, the strange, almost mystical language of Demon's Souls kept on rolling round... Grass required, lizards to kill, flamelurkers, magic swords... you know who you are.By 1600hrs, the blog had descended into its traditional Friday afternoon one liners, dashed off before the authors retreated to their sordid little grief holes. The only man to offer sensible analysis was StiLteD when he said, "In retrospect i think the 'best of'person today should just copy an extract from an earlier 'best of' that everyone's forgotten by now." Wish I'd thought of that.End gameJoin theofficial Gamesblog spotify listand share your own favourite tunes.

Twenty-six years after .com was first unveiled to the world, officials have swept away tight regulations governing website naming, opening up a whole world of personalised web address suffixes.Icann, the internet naming board, approved one of the biggest changes in the web's history on Monday, allowing the number of web suffixes to expand virtually without limit. Currently there are 22 international "top level domain" suffixes such as ".com", but sites with suffixes such as ".sport" and ".eco" will pop up next year.Peter Dengate Thrush, chairman of Icann's board of directors, said: "Today's decision will usher in a new internet age. We have provided a platform for the next generation of creativity and inspiration. Unless there is a good reason to restrain it, innovation should be allowed to run free."Analysts say they expect 500 to 1,000 domain suffixes, mostly for companies and products looking to stamp their mark on web addresses, but also for cities and generic names such as .bank or .hotel.Websites can now be categorised by subjects such as industry, geography and ethnicity – as well as using Arabic, Chinese and other scripts. There are also 290 country suffixes such as ".uk" and ".fr", which will remain unchanged for now.Groups have formed to back ".sport" for sporting sites, and two conservationist groups separately are seeking the right to operate an ".eco" suffix.It will also now be possible to have website names entirely in Mandarin or Cyrillic or any other script, which will ease the problem of reading and writing addresses for the majority of people who do not use the Roman alphabet.The growth will also come as the internet shifts to the next-generation IPv6 addressing system for its basic systems, which enables far more devices to be attached to the internet.Icann approved the move after six years of negotiations, in which concerns were repeatedly expressed that the enormous expansion of suffixes could lead to extra costs for businesses of registering a site with their trademark as the number of suffixes explodes.During the 1990s there were hundreds of cases of "domain squatting" in which people would register sites that used companies' trademarked names, effectively holding them to ransom. Expanding the number of domains could make that far worse.But it would also ease the pressure on the ".com" domain, created 26 years ago. In May 2009 a study found that 74% of websites were in the .com domain space."It will allow corporations to better take control of their brands," said Theo Hnarakis, chief executive of Melbourne IT, which manages online brands for clients such as Volvo, LEGO and GlaxoSmithKline. "For example, .apple or .ipad would take customers right to those products."But others said that the promise of space could be a double-edged sword. "If you're a company with a lot of money, such as Barclays, then you could buy the '.barclays' suffix and build a little island on the internet, on the basis that you can persuade customers that only legitimate Barclays sites will end with that," said Charlie Abrahams, of the brand protection company MarkMonitor. "If your brand has just three letters, it might be worth it. If you're Tommy Hilfiger, it's probably not, because I can't imagine anyone bothering to type all that at the end of a URL."However, the principal beneficiaries are likely to be the internet registrars who sell the rights to site names. Icann has set a $185,000 fee per suffix, and applicants have to work their way through a 360-page guidebook to prepare their bids ahead of the first suffix auctions, which start on 12 January 2012 and run for 90 days.Icann says it will auction suffixes if multiple parties have legitimate claims. However, it expects companies will reach deals to avoid a public auction."I think we'll see much more of that going on than see auctions generating circuses," said Dengate Thrush. "But there is that prospect that there will be a couple of identical applicants and applications."Adrian Kinderis, chief executive of AusRegistry International, which helps companies to register domains and manages names such as ".au" for Australia, said: "It's a significant undertaking. We're calling it the Olympic bid. But it's worth it for corporations that have suffered from things like trademark infringement  and can now carve out a niche on the internet."Abrahams estimates that it would cost a typical company £1m to run their own suffix for the minimum 10 years required. "It is a lot of work – but if someone beats you to it, you have lost it forever," he noted.The Icann board approved the move by 13 votes to one with two abstentions in a meeting in Singapore. "This is the start of a whole new phase for the Internet," said But tThe move could also create enormous confusion for consumers and companies. It greatly expands the risks from "phishing" sites because they could use confusing domain names in language scripts that look similar to existing ones to capture peoples' details. And for companies, the challenge will be to decide whether to register their names in all possible domains, or to create their own suffix, or to limit themselves to a small number of domains.
One of the joys of attending E3 is that "look to the stars" moment, which occurs when a publisher or developer unveils something that's both unexpected and wondrous. It's an instant which eradicates all my cynical reserve and reminds me of just why I love video games so much.This year, the game that accomplished this and caused my jaw to drop was Human Head's sci-fi shooter Prey 2. And it came at me from completely out of nowhere.I didn't play the first Prey game, so I had no idea what to expect from Prey 2. I have been told, however, by those who have experienced the delights of the first installment that Prey 2 represents something of a sea change for the franchise.In the original Prey, players took on the role of a Native American called Tommy, and used guns and portal travel to fight off brutal aliens who were hunting him down. Prey 2, on the other hand, is all about a US Marshall called Killian Samuels, who decides to become a bounty hunter in a gritty, futuristic city on an alien planet – as you do.The only thing linking the two games, as far as I can tell from the demo, is that their protagonists were aboard the same plane which was hijacked mid-flight by otherworldly abductors.To be honest, the demo didn't look very promising to begin with. It opened with Killian crawling through the wreckage of the plane, taking in the alien world around him and then fending off some enemies with a handgun before being knocked out. However, after that very ho-hum five minutes, things improved dramatically.The action flashed forward a few years, and we found Killian wandering a neon-encrusted urban jungle, on a planet called Exodus. We're informed that he's also lost his memory, and the game's plot will centre largely on him learning about his past. In the meantime, Killian's working as a bounty hunter, rounding up alien ne'er-do-wells at the behest of a contractor who speaks to him through his headset in a feminine, metallic voice.The first mission in the demo involves Killian finding his target in strip club in a particularly seedy part of the city called the Bowery. The city, it has to be said, is one of the game's greatest assets; the streets are dank and threatening, neon signs blaze in the dark and cars fly past overhead. The atmosphere of the city is distinctly cyber-noir and it's obvious that Human Head have taken more than one or two visual cues from Blade Runner, as well as a ton of Anime classics such as Akira and Cyber City OEDO 808.As Killian strolls through the strip joint, the HUD takes on an electronic tinge, painting all the patrons different colours. Those who appear in green don't need to be worried about, while those in yellow and red are potential and imminent threats respectively. One particularly patron has a WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE read-out appear on him. We're told the player now has a couple of options – he can arrest the perp, knock him out or shoot him in the back right there and then. Suddenly the alien in question bolts and Killian takes off after him.It's here Prey 2 reveals its second trump card – Killian navigates the cybernetic sprawl using parkour. As he chases his intended captive, we watch as he vaults over ledges, platforms up to higher vantage points and slides in and out of cover. The word to describe the gameplay is "fluid". While Mirror's Edge is certainly an inspiration for Prey 2, the game seems to handle a bit more like Brink.Killian uses an item called Electric Bolos to down the fleeing perp and then a quick shot from his sidearm to send him into the next life. He's informed that the bounty has landed in his account, and then he moves on.We're told that what we just witnessed is an example of what Human Head calls "ambient bounties". These are essentially side missions the player can engage in if they're not in a hurry to tackle the core missions just yet. They've got other free-roaming options as well. They can intervene in a fist-fight and save the poor soul getting pummeled, which may earn them some quick cash. They can mug citizens for money. They can tip strangers over the side of the Bowery's numerous platforms and send them plummeting to their deaths.There's a backstop to the player creating too much mayhem; a floating robotic disc called the "eye in the sky" descends and scans them as a warning if they're behaving badly. We're told that players who run rampant will inevitably be attacked by this automated cop, and if that weren't enough, they'll also have reinforcements to deal with. In other words, play nice, or the city's security system will get GTA-five-star-wanted-level on you.Another nice touch is that the player can holster their firearm. This might not sound like much, but it lends the game quite a realistic tone. Not only does the player's interaction with the city feel more authentic because they're not wandering around with a massive gun in the HUD at all times, but when the player does decide to pull out their weapon, it causes a reaction in the NPCs in their vicinity. Some cower away, while others turn toward the player menacingly. In Prey 2, it pays to keep your iron by your side unless you really need to use it.After this brief demonstration of the freedom players can expect, the demo launches into a core mission. Killian receives a call that an alien named Dra'Gar, who has a sizable bounty on his head, is in his vicinity. Dra'Gar's exact location is unknown, but Killian's contractor has a tip; an informant named Krux may know his whereabouts. She also wants Dra'Gar brought in alive.After another demonstration of Killian's ability to quickly scramble up to a balcony via neighbouring buildings, we come face to face with Krux who demands a large amount of money to part with Dra'Gar's location. Killian's short on cash and the demo's short on time, so rather than do another side mission, Killian hauls out his pistol and shoots Krux's bodyguard in the face. He then trains the gun on Krux, which convinces the alien to tell him that Dra'Gar is in a nearby nightclub."Your reputation precedes you," says Krux. "They said you were stupid. I will give you the info, but you can expect me to call in a favour down the line. Now lower your gun."We're told Krux will come into play later in the game as a source of future mission Killian hot-foots it the club. Once at the destination, he scans the patrons, finding Dra'Gar surrounded by a large number of thugs. Killian grabs one to use as a human shield, but after a few seconds, his meat-shield has been peppered with bullets and he's back to popping in and out of cover.After taking out Dra'Gar's goons with a couple of accurately lobbed grenades, Killian brings the perp to the ground, once again using his Electric Bolos. Unfortunately it seems that Dra'Gar has a teleporting ability which allows him to escape his shackles. Suddenly we're in for a chase.Over the remainder of the demo, we're wowed by the fantastic, free-running gameplay. Killain slides into and out of cover gracefully. He leaps over obstacles, clambers up platforms and even glides down to the ground from high-ledges using rocket boots. When combat occurs, he takes cover, and can use precision aiming or blind-fire to take out his enemies. Each ledge is both a pathway he can use, or an obstacle he can take cover behind.When Killian finally chases Dra'Gar to the ground, he uses a device which throws his target into an electric prison of sorts, disabling his teleporting ability and suspending him in the air. Here, another plot avenue opens up, because Dra'Gar offers Killian more money than he's being paid to bring him, to let him go.Killian, keen at this stage it seems to keep up a good relationship with his contractor, declines and teleports Dra'Gar and fulfils his contract. We're told that Killian could have let Dra'Gar go and he could have also used his capture device to torture the alien for information about the mission or the location of nearby ordinance.Once Dra'Gar is transported away for the bounty, however, Killain receives a message from a character called S'Dyi. Apparently he's just angered Dra'Gar's brother and a contract has just been put out on his life. As the demo ends, a large brutal looking creature sporting as many guns as it does teeth stamps into view. The screen then fades to black.It's at this point I realise my mouth is still hanging open. If I were honest, I'd say that I hadn't been expecting much from Prey 2, but the first thing I did on leaving Bethesda's booth was to check to see if I could pre-order it. This is a game which promises an enthralling plot, set in an unforgettable world, boasting gameplay and gadgets which make getting to grips with it the most mouth-watering prospect. If it delivers on the promise of its E3 demo, it could be one of the best games of 2012. So, fingers crossed ...•Prey 2 will be released for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2012
When Kinect Sports was launched last year to coincide with the arrival of the Kinect sensor, it felt more like a tech demo – albeit an enjoyable one – than a game. Here was a series of mini-games that felt like they were designed primarily to show off what the Kinect interface could do and how it differed from the motion sensor controls of the Wii and PS3.There were a couple of standout games; football, table tennis and bowling were all immense fun. But track and field and boxing weren't very engaging and volleyball, while enjoyable, could prove problematic for Kinect owners with low-ceilings.Still, despite its drawbacks, Kinect Sports was a massive hit, selling more than 3m units worldwide, and making the prospect of a sequel inevitable. Kinect Sports: Season 2 is set to arrive in stores in the fourth financial quarter of 2011, boasting a brand new set of mini-games, which according to the game's executive producer, Joe Nickolls, have all been requested by fans of the first game."When we first sat down to create Kinect Sports 2, we wanted to find out what sports people wanted to see or play that weren't in the first game," he says. "We wanted a really big marketing and consumer survey asking our fans, of all the sports they wanted to play, if they thought about Kinect, which would be the top choices?"The six sports in Kinect Sports: Season 2 are the result of that survey; American football, tennis, skiing, golf, darts and baseball. While on the surface, they seem largely American-centric, Nickolls says they are the result of responses from fans all over the world."You have something like darts showing up, which was largely driven by UK players," he says, "Europe is really big on tennis and golf. American football and baseball are obviously driven by the States, but there's massive overlap between here and Europe on the decision to include skiing and, funnily enough, darts."At Microsoft's demo booth, the two games available to play were golf and American football. With golf, players face the module and place their hands above their heads to start a round. They then select a right or left hand interface and turn their bodies sideways to the sensor as though they're standing over an imaginary ball.Players then line up their shot and send the ball flying down the fairway by putting their hands together and swinging their arms as though they were holding a golf club. They can even take a couple of practice swings before committing to a shot, if they like. Once they're on or near the green, they can change clubs simply by saying out loud which one they'd like to select. It's an engaging little game which is sure to appeal to players right across the board.American football might be a tougher sell in this regard. Players won't need to worry so much about rules such as pass interference, but the list of plays may put them in unfamiliar territory. Still, Nickolls says that, at its best, Kinect Sports: Season 2 could act as a gateway – albeit a highly simplified one – for new fans to the sport."Trying to explain football to someone in England can sometimes be as difficult as explaining cricket to an American," he says. "There are a lot of rules and regulations that either side would find weird. But it's still a pretty cool game, and we found that a lot of people were wanting to try American football without feeling like an idiot."While this might work in the privacy of one's own home, I can tell you from personal experience it doesn't work when you're standing in front of the Microsoft booth at E3, as crowds of people walk past, pointing and laughing as you hurl an imaginary football through the air. Still, once the initial embarrassment subsides, it's easy enough to get into the swing of things. I played the quarterback and the demo-booth's attendant played a wide receiver. I called a play, my team assembled on the line of scrimmage and after I yelled "hike!" the ball was snapped.The players on the field run in pre-determined routes according to the play the quarterback selects. Then it's all a matter of turning one's body sideways and making a throwing motion in the direction of any open player. Player 2 immediately takes control of the teammate on the end of any successful pass completion, and then they have to run quickly on the spot to make it to the end-zone. Along the way, they can use a hand to fend off any attacking players from the other team.It's all pretty lightweight fun and it's sure to entice very young players, or gaming families. But will it be able to compete with the first entry and its multimillion sales figures? Nickolls says he doesn't find the prospect of following Kinect Sports intimidating."Sports – and this is going to sound cheesy – is a universal language. You either like sports or you don't," he says, "And then there are people who want to like sports, but there is such a massive learning curve on those game, that they feel intimidated. We have a way for you to get into sports which cuts through that barrier.""Our objective in Kinect Sports: Season 2 is to make things as deep or as shallow as you want," he says. "At a beginner's skill level we'll take care of some of the aiming or the running for you. When you kick the difficulty up a notch, we're tracking the velocity of your arm and your aim, making it more realistic and true to the real-world experience."•Kinect Sports Season II will be released for Xbox Kinect in winter 2011

The internet naming board Icann has decided to allow the number of internet "domains" to expand enormously in one of the biggest changes ever to the internet's method of naming sites.New website suffixes should start appearing late in 2012 and could be categorised by subjects including industry, geography and ethnicity and include Arabic, Chinese and other scripts.A special meeting of Icann's board approved a plan to expand the number of possible internet domain name endings from the current 22 – such as ".com", ".org" and ".net" (which are separate of the country-specific domain endings such as ".uk") – to allow domains "in any language or script", according to Rod Beckstrom, president and chief executive of Icann."Today's decision will usher in a new internet age," said Peter Dengate Thrush, chairman of ICANN's board of directors. "We have provided a platform for the next generation of creativity and inspiration. Unless there is a good reason to restrain it, innovation should be allowed to run free."But the move could also create enormous confusion for consumers and companies. It greatly expands the risks from "phishing" sites because they could use confusing domain names in language scripts that look similar to existing ones to capture peoples' details.And for companies, the challenge will be to decide whether to register their names in all possible domains, or to create their own suffix, or to limit themselves to a small number of domains.The need for a larger number of global top-level domains – gTLDs – has become increasingly obvious with the expanding number of languages being used on the internet and the shift towards IPv6, a new numbering system for internet addresses that enormously expands the number of devices that can be connected directly to the net.Icann's decision follows years of discussion and debate, and went through more than seven revisions. Icann insists that strong efforts were made to address the concerns of all interested parties, and to ensure that the security, stability and resiliency of the internet are not compromised.The move is the biggest change to the internet's domain naming system since ".com" was introduced 26 years ago, which opened out the formerly academic and military system to commercial use.Icann will receive applications for new domain names for 90 days from 12 January 2012. The fee is $185,000, and the form for application is 360 pages long. It will also begin an awareness campaign pointing out that it has introduced the new scheme.
Monday again. Tell us what did you do at the weekend! Clean it clean, though, eh?
Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first render naive. That means us, folks. A prime case in point is provided by our (ie Anglo-American) response to the latest French initiative in internet control. The background is that earlier this month the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA), France's media regulator, ruled that the country's TV networks and radio stations will no longer be able to explicitly mention Facebook or Twitter on air, except when discussing a story in which either company is directly involved.In ruling thus, the regulator was implementing a 1992 government decree that makes it illegal for media organisations to promote brands during news broadcasts, on the grounds that doing so might inhibit competition. This means that French broadcast journalists cannot invite viewers or listeners to "follow" them on Facebook or Twitter but instead have to resort to circumlocutions like "your favourite social network".A spokeswoman for the CSA explainedthe thinking behind the ban. "Why give preference to Facebook, which is worth billions of dollars," she asked, "when there are many other social networks that are struggling for recognition? This would be a distortion of competition.  If we allow Facebook and Twitter to be cited on air, it's opening a Pandora's Box – other social networks will complain to us saying, 'Why not us?' "Quite. You can imagine the derisive reaction to this in the Anglo-American media, old and new. The broadcasting ruling was linked with President Sarkozy's clueless remarks at the G8 summit about "civilising" the internet, and interpreted as a sign of cultural resentment at American dominance in cyberspace. "Poor old Frenchies," was the general tenor of the commentary, "they just don't get it."Actually, the joke's on us. As it happens, the French do "get" it. To appreciate that, just do a simple thought-experiment. Suppose, for a moment, that BBC News started to use "Dyson" instead of "vacuum cleaner" in its reports of dust-mite infestations, or "Bollinger" instead of "champagne" in its coverage of the drinks industry. We'd be outraged. Yet that is effectively what we are thoughtlessly doing when it comes to dealing with phenomena like social networking: taking the dominant commercial brand and pretending that it's generic.What's going on, in other words, is that our media are treating Twitter and Facebook as if they were public utilities, like the open web. In fact it's even worse than that, as Dave Winer, one of the web's elder statesmen,pointed out last week.  "The Library of Congress," he writes, "which is part of the government, is subsidising Twitter by doing a complete archive of Twitter  before making a serious attempt at archiving the web. This helps cement Twitter as the medium of record, which is ridiculous. The market is just getting started. How can you justify the government taking sides over other equivalent (or better) ways to communicate, that are not owned by a company (like the web, for example). If this isn't against the law, to use taxpayer funds to help a company achieve dominance over competitors, it should be against the law."Spot on. The illusion that corporations like Facebook or Twitter are public utilities is not only naive, it's positively pernicious because it enables them to get away with the pretence that they are solely forces for good, rather than single-minded corporations whose loyalties are ultimately to their shareholders, no matter how soothing their bedside manners are.Naivety about social networking was much in evidence atthe excellent conference on "Power and Media"organised by Charlie Beckett and his colleagues at the London School of Economics on 10 June. There was a lot of heady talk about the role of social media in the Arab Spring. Nothing, we were given to understand by some speakers, would ever be the same again. But a question (from me) about the downside of having companies such as Facebook and Twitter exercising what amounts to political power was met with uncomprehending stares, and a charming and very articulate Egyptian blogger explained patiently to me how the people had taken over Twitter and bent it to their&nbsp;will.As it happens, we may see Facebook flexing its muscles sooner rather than later. There was some feverish speculation last week aboutwhether Zuckerberg's monster might have peaked. This was accompanied by stories about Facebook looking wistfully eastwards, where huge – and as yet untapped – markets beckon. If Zuckerberg and Co do indeed expand into, say, China, I'm sure they will prove endlessly accommodating to the powers that be. And then we'll have to admit that perhaps the French do get it.Sacrebleu!
In 1998, at arguably the height of its creative powers, Nintendo released a game that is commonly regarded as the finest ever made.The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timeis considered the pinnacle of game design; an action-adventure par excellence which has inspired countless other titles. Though Nintendo has rereleased the game several times, this 3D version, launched to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Zelda series, is the first time it hasn't appeared in its original form.The makeover, courtesy of little-known developer Grezzo Co, helps to breathe new visual life into a game whose looks had undeniably faded. Though emerging on to the vast plains of Hyrule Field can't possibly have the dazzling impact it had more than a decade ago, especially given the disparity between handheld and TV screens,Ocarina's world looks brighter and crisper than ever. Shops and towns throb with detail, just as graphical tweaks for the menagerie of monsters found in and outside the puzzle-ridden dungeons augment the still striking creature design.Nudging the console's 3D slider upwards completes the picture. The added depth makes navigation easier, while arresting effects abound – fairy helper Navi swoops in and out of the screen as she follows elfin hero Link, while fireflies appear to hover gently in the space just above your thumbs. Meanwhile, outdoor areas seem to stretch wider and farther than in the N64 original, with the moon rising and falling in the distance.Yet these cosmetic nips and tucks are not the only adjustments. The gyroscopic sensor in the 3DS hardware is put to good use, allowing you to aim from a first-person perspective by moving the console around; awkward when playing on public transport, perhaps, but a godsend when firing Link's slingshot at fast-moving foes. An elegant and entirely optional hint system is a welcome sop to newcomers, while a host of additional features adds extra value to what is already a substantial quest.These changes help to modernise a game now two generations old, but even without such revisions, Ocarina feels timeless. It is, simply, a rollicking good adventure: an exciting and epic fairy tale that satisfies the mind, the reflexes and the heart in equal measure. To venture into the world of Hyrule is to be enriched and enraptured by a game that remains, 13 years on, the one to beat.
Madness Returnsis the second dark and twisted video game interpretation of Lewis Carroll'sWonderland. Here, picking up from the original,American McGee's Alice, we find our grown-up and deeply troubled Alice tormented by the loss of her family, who were killed in a fire. Having been released from Rutledge's Insane Asylum to be cared for by her psychiatrist, the player's task is to lead Alice around a creepy Victorian London and a curious Wonderland to help her solve the mystery of her family's death – piecing together repressed memories from the recesses of her mind.The game's platform elements are brought to life by magnificent, but utterly disturbing, comic book-style, blood-soaked graphics, with exploding teapot bombs, machine gun pepper mills and Alice's trusty Vorpal blade to battle bizarre and chilling enemies. But it's lightened by diverting puzzle elements, too, such as working out baddies' weaknesses.Gamers familiar with the original will notice a big step forward in the fluidity of controls, with much improved melee strikes and weapon features and, while it may feel somewhat linear to those used to more&nbsp;expansive RPGs, this is a story that remains both surprisingly fun and often enjoyably scary.
Having passed through several different studios over its 15-year development, sci-fi comedyDuke Nukem Foreversets a new precedent for how too many cooks really can get busy with the spoilage. Sequel to 1996's bawdily brilliant first-person shooterDuke Nukem 3D,Foreveris a title that had an almost impossible amount of hype to live up to. Sadly, it fails.Ugly design work is made more unpleasant by visual fidelity years out of date. Gameplay-wise, it is stuck in the same time period as its predecessor, requiring only that you point yourself at waves of screeching alien enemies and keep your trigger finger compressed until they stop screeching. The series' touted interactivity is reduced to endless not very funny gag sequences that reach such impressive heights as playing with faeces and signing books called "Why I'm So Great by Duke Nukem".Glimmers of past glory are found in features like a smart, ego-based shield system that sees Duke boosting his defences by drinking beer, but such additions are few and far between. Against such excellent competition asBulletstormandPortal 2,Duke Nukem Foreverjust doesn't make the grade.
Price£16,995MPG47.9Top speed116mphWhen it comes to marital harmony, some issues cause more of  a ripple than others. Being unmasked as  a bigamist or gambling away the deeds to the family home will guarantee an awkward conversation over breakfast. But lower down the list there are still plenty of everyday grievances that crawl under the skin of civilised cohabitation – and many of these occur in the car. There's map reading, music choice, alleged "macho driving"… and, of course, the big one – parking. So it may come as a&nbsp;relief to you to learn that the latest Focus from Ford comes fitted with a marital aid that will take the heat out of a row quicker than you can say "superinjunction". It costs an extra £525 – a bargain I'd have thought – and is called the Park Pilot. It's a&nbsp;clever gizmo that turns that trickiest of manoeuvres – the reverse parallel park into a small space on a busy street while impatient road users make nasty faces at you – into a five-second pleasure trip.The Pilot uses a&nbsp;series of sensors buried in the bumpers and a&nbsp;sophisticated computer mapping system. All you do is pull alongside a space, stick the car in reverse and let go of the steering wheel. The Focus then magically manoeuvres itself into the space – the steering wheel spinning as if possessed by the god of parking.This technology has existed for a year or two, but not at this price in a middle-of-the-road, medium-sized vehicle. And it's not the only smart act in the Focus package. The new Ford bristles with technological innovations like a&nbsp;cheese-and-pineapple hedgehog. It will, for instance, recognise traffic signs and post the speed limit on the dashboard; it has a blind-spot information system; it dips the headlights when an oncoming car is detected; it sounds an alert if it thinks you are nodding off; it'll tell you what gear you should be in; whether your tyres are at the optimum pressure; and what the winning lottery numbers are… well, almost. It also  has an award-winning low-speed anti-collision system which automatically applies the brakes if  a crash is imminent, which spells the end for those maddening slow-motion city shunts – unless, of course, you happen to get hit from behind.Any new launch is important for the motor industry, but the launch of the Focus is arguably the most crucial of 2011. The Focus has been the bestselling car in the UK for 10 of the past 12 years, with more than 10m sold in 120 countries. The Focus matters. And this means there is simply no way Ford will get it wrong. Hundreds of hours have been spent developing the cockpit and seating position. It was test-driven the equivalent of 88 times around the world, in conditions ranging from -40C to 80C. The bonnet, doors and tailgate were opened and slammed shut 300,000 times.In all, the Focus is sporty, efficient, agile and technologically sophisticated – and it could just save your marriage.Email Martin atmartin.love@observer.co.ukor visitguardian.co.uk/profile/martinlovefor all his reviews in  one place
"The imperative to self-knowledge has always been at the heart of philosophical inquiry," wrote MIT professor Sherry Turkle in the seminal book about the web and the self,Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet. Published in 1995 as the second part of a trilogy that examined our relationships with technology, it looked at how we are who we are in online spaces. And what that means for us offline.The good news is that the results are positive: "Play has always been an important aspect of our individual efforts to build identity," she said, referencing developmental psychologist Erik Erikson, and nodding to the theories of psychoanalysts Freud, Lacan and Jung. "In terms of our views of the self," she wrote, "new images of multiplicity, heterogeneity, flexibility, and fragmentation dominate current thinking about human identity."In this postmodern world, anyone can be anything they'd like, even a lesbian Syrian blogger. Tom MacMaster, who was uncovered to much dismay as the author behind the fictional, Damascus-based "Amina Abdullah Arraf al-Omari", maintains that he was using the platform to express himself and to play around with self-presentation. He is the most recent high-profile case that demonstrates Turkle's description of the web as an identity laboratory.At the timeLife on the Screenwas released, the freaks and geeks populating the internet's tubes were a specialised bunch; most were college students and their professors from a remarkably small talent pool, and a surprisingly small geography. They were tech-savvy, and generically open-minded about the new fields of virtual exploration that lay within the networks of this nascent communication platform. They were, in other words, liberal, enlightened types who were more willing to embrace the unprecedented fluidity of self-expression that this new technology uniquely afforded than technophobes, who thought everyone online was either a freak or a geek.As a psychoanalyst and a web user herself, Turkle spent much of the book explaining why the articulation of multiple personalities wasn't pathological. Contrary to its Latin root, identity need not mean "the same", she argued. "No one aspect can be claimed as the absolute, true self", she wrote, maintaining that the web allowed us the opportunity to get to know our "inner diversity". In the great psychoanalytic tradition, she said that self-actualisation meant coming to terms with who we are, and integrating each aspect of it into a coherent and well-integrated us.Nowadays, almost everyone has experienced this kind of identity play. Even if you've never ventured into an online game or been a signed-up member of a web community, you've probably developed a profile for a social network, written a blog, styled a website, commented on an article or contributed to the ongoing tsunami of updates on Twitter. You've probably done more than one. Congratulations: you have experienced the postmodern experience of actively constructing your online identity.Just as Turkle described more than 15 years ago, the web is a medium in which action is absolutely essential to express ourselves. Unlike the rich space of offline life, where our identity cues are given away on sight, sound, smell, touch and taste, online we perform.Most of us present an idealised "me", fabricated specifically for our various, compartmentalised and implied audiences. Often that means putting our best foot forward in each of the media we use: we preen and pout for profile pics, we voice attitudes and opinions that we think will make us appeal to the people whom we most want to like us and we post and tweet information that we find interesting and which won't make us look rubbish. Most importantly, and for the most part, we think first.But things are different from the time when Turkle was writingLife on the Screen. Most communities were populated by strangers, and that anonymity afforded a frivolity with the self that was relatively consequence-free. Nowadays, our virtual social lives are increasingly integrated with our offline social lives. For example, Facebook demands account holders' real names and trades on a currency of real friendship. The freedom of expression is curtailed by the threat of offline consequences from online actions. Today, your reputation offline is far more closely tied to your reputation online than before.Contemporary online identity is also no longer in the sole control of the individual. On the modern web, we comprise the personal, idealised representations that we curate and the pictures of ourselves looking not so hot, taken by so-called "friends" at a party and uploaded on to a social network. The halcyon days of identity play Turkle described in 1995 are not available to most of today's web users; in fact, our experience of contemporary identity online is disarmingly similar to offline.Turkle's latest book,Alone Together, is published in the UK this week. It is an astonishing volte-face from her previous two books, which were much more utopian in tone. Her new approach to our relationship with technology is informed by 15 years of observing a mainstream consumer base co-construct itself with persistent access to the network. She believes this has taken its toll on who we are. "It&nbsp;used to be, 'I have a feeling, I want to make a call,'" she said at a recent debate at the British Library, "[and this has changed] to, 'I want to have a feeling, I&nbsp;need to send a text.'"I still subscribe to the old Turkle. Consequence-free online environments allow us to practise and play without fear of offline repercussion, and offer an extraordinary place to experience the fluidity of our selves. On the internet, I can be anyone, even a dog. As Tom MacMaster found, there still are places online where this is possible. He found his audience, as have I: I tweet, therefore I am.
The Burning HouseIf your home were on fire, what would you take with you if you had time to choose a handful of stuff? As well as being a way to help you declutter, answering this question reveals a great deal about your personality, priorities and interests. Here, a bunch of random contributors do so in a photographic format – their possessions laid out neatly and beautifully shot for posterity. Family photo albums (and memory cards) feature prominently in the resulting collection of things that really matter to people, as do favourite shirts, childhood toys and albums. The wrestle between practical and sentimental is common, but is resolved by one 60-year-old in a bag containing money and peanut butter.BurgeracBurgerac.

The Electronic Entertainment Expo, recently held in Los Angeles, is the videogame world's biggest annual event, acting as a kind of hype lightning conductor for the next couple of years' blockbuster games and new hardware. Below is a glimpse of what we'll be playing in the near future.The gamesAs ever, this year's E3 did a brisk trade in sequels.The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimpromises a role-playing experience even more vast than its immediate predecessor, but with more focus and less tendency to get lost in menus;Dust 514brings console gamers into massively multiplayer online space opera EVE, casting them as planet-locked mercenaries for hire; adventurousUncharted 3: Drake's Deceptionlooks beautiful, as befits a franchise that's rapidly becoming PS3's flagship;Halo 4is on its way, not that anyone doubted that for a second;Minecraft, the limitlessly popular, modification-friendly indie sandbox game is coming to Xbox;BioShock Infinite's move from sea bed to cloud city seems appropriately vertigo-inducing; whileBattlefield 3looks how you'd imagine real war might. And finally a killer application for 3D TV:Resistance 3will be capable of showing a separate full-screen image to different players on the same telly.MicrosoftKinect.E3 is huge, but within that the announcements made by the three big hardware manufacturers are its highlights. This year Microsoft had only one thing on its mind:Kinect. Controller-free play is now infesting everything fromMass Effect 3– awkwardly call out voice commands to cohorts in battle and choose conversational responses – toGhost Recon: Future Soldier, where you use Minority Report-looking gestures to upgrade guns, to head butting Romans inRyse. Kinect is fascinating technology, but so far, apart from the psychedelic Child Of Eden, hasn't added terribly much fun.SonyVita.Although lacking Microsoft's pathological obsession with motion control, Sony still appeared determined to shoehorn Move, its high-precision take on the Wii-mote paradigm, into just about everything. But there was also PlayStation Portable replacementVita(out later this year), which adds a large touchscreen, two serviceable analogue joysticks, cameras and a rear touch panel, the latter being easily the most intriguing facet of what could finally be a threat to Nintendo's handheld gaming hegemony. Games for the system were headlined by the luscious-lookingUncharted: Golden Abyssand an equally gorgeousLittleBigPlanet, both seemingly delivered without compromise on a portable.NintendoWii U.Its share price may have tanked for days afterwards, but Nintendo probably "won" this year's press conference face-off. AnnouncingWii U(out 2012) , a console that looks very much like a Wii, but with HD graphics and using controllers that are as much like an iPad as they are conventional joypads. With a 6.2in touchscreen, two analogue sticks and the usual tilt and accelerometer controls, Wii U also lets you use all the various remotes, guns, SNES-style pads and games that worked with Wii and which may already be cluttering up your living room. The announcement of the Nintendo eShop for 3DS was soon followed by its launch and it's a great deal more solid and reliable than its creaky DSi forebear was.Pokedex 3DandExcitebike 3Dare available as free downloads.
