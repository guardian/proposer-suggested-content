Millions of children are already playing Minecraft at home, whether on computers, consoles or mobile devices. Now the game’s parent company Microsoft wants to encourage more teachers to use it in the classroom.Microsoft, whichbought the game’s developer Mojang for $2.5bnin 2014, haslaunched a new site aimed at teachers, aiming to foster a community of educators swapping lesson plans and other tips based on Minecraft.The new site wasannouncedby Microsoft’s vice president of worldwide education Anthony Salcito, complete with a list of some of the ways schools are already incorporating Minecraft into their lessons.“Elementary students in Seattleare learning foundational math skills by calculating perimeter, area and volume in Minecraft during a Saturday math program.Middle school students in Los Angelesare learning about major world religions as part of their humanities class. They are visiting sacred sites in their city, researching international sites and then building them in Minecraft.Alfriston College students in New Zealandare partnering with Auckland War Memorial Museum to learn the history of the New Zealand people who served in the 1915 Gallipoli campaign by re-creating the landscape in Minecraft, block by block.Middle schoolersare learning the building blocks of computer science in an online Minecraft coding camp.Elementary students in Scotlandare learning about city planning and engineering by reimaging, redesigning and then building in Minecraft what they think Dundee waterfront should look like.”Mojang has sold more than 70m copies of Minecraft across all platforms since the game’s launch in 2009, with the game becoming a firm favourite among children as well as the adult gamers it was originally aimed at.Minecraft has also spawned a thriving network of YouTube channels, including one – run by British creator Joseph “Stampy” Garrett – that recentlylaunched an educational show called Wonder Questfilmed within the game.Other educational projects involving Minecraft includeMinecraftEdu, a separate version of Minecraft with features designed for schools, and its own community of educators swapping tips on how to use it.Related:Three ways to use Minecraft imaginatively in the classroomUS company ThoughtSTEM haslaunched an add-on for Minecraft called LearnToMod, which aims to teach children programming skills through making their own modifications (“mods”) for the game.In 2013, Google worked with MinecraftEdu and Caltech’s Institute for Quantum Information and Matterto launch a mod called qCraftthat used Minecraft to teach children about quantum computing. Meanwhile, a project announced in March 2015 will seeMinecraftEdu supplied to every secondary school in Northern Ireland.Microsoft’s launch of the Minecraft in Education site comes days before Minecon, Mojang’s annual conference for all things Minecraft.Microsoft will be one of the exhibitors at the two-day event in London, where several panel sessions will focus on Minecraft’s role in schools.
Social app Snapchat hopes its 100 million daily active users will give the thumbs up... to spending less time holding their thumbs on their smartphone screens to see photos and videos.The company’s latest app update introduces a new “tap to view” control, which replaces the “press and hold” user interface that’s been used since Snapchat’s launch in 2011.“Today marks a pretty big change for Snapchat — you no longer have to press and hold the screen to view a Snap or Story — instead, simply Tap to View,”explained Snapchat in a blog postannouncing the new user interface.“This means no more tired thumbs while watching a several-hundred-second Story… and a little getting used to for anyone who has been Snapchatting for a while.”When Snapchat was just for sending photos and short video clips to friends, holding your thumb on the screen for the duration of viewing was rarely complained about.As the app has expanded – particularly with its Discover section of video reports from partners like Vice, MTV and Cosmopolitan – so the video lengths have increased, leading to the controls change.Snapchat’s latest updates includes another new feature that’s arguably just as significant for its users: the introduction of two-factor authentication when logging in to use the app.“Once you enable it, bad guys will have a much harder time if they try to hack into your account,” claimed Snapchat, although some of the highest-profile security breaches in the company’s history have come from third-party apps that people use to log in to Snapchat, rather than the app itself.Finally, Snapchat has added the option to add a photo to the middle of users’ Snapcodes – the scannable codes that can be exchanged with friends to follow one another in the app.Related:Snapchat boss makes 'don't be creepy' pledgeThe update comes at a busy time for Snapchat, which wasreportedly valued at $16bnwhen raising up to $650m in new funding earlier in 2015.The company recentlyunveiled a new native-advertising agencyin partnership with the Daily Mail and advertising group WPP, while it is alsohiring journalists to cover the 2016 US presidential racewithin its app.Chief executive Evan Spiegel has also beentrying to explain himself to parents, with a YouTube video outlining his views on why their children are using Snapchat.“Pictures are being used for talking. So when you see your children taking a zillion photos of things that you would never take a picture of, it’s cos they’re using photographs to talk,” he said.Now, at least, all that talking won’t be tiring out their thumbs as much.
Videos uploaded directly to Facebook are watched more than 4bn times a day according to the social network. Now it wants their uploaders to be able to make money from those videos.The social network is testing a new “suggested videos” feature in its news feed, which will see videos from partner publishers and creators recommended to Facebook users, with advertisements running in between them.According to Variety,Facebook will keep 45% of the revenues, with partners taking the other 55%. Fox Sports, the NBA, Hearst, Funny or Die and Tastemade are among the first partners in the trial, which is currently restricted to Facebook’s iPhone app.“We’ve heard consistently from media companies and other video creators that if they were able to make money from their videos, they would publish more,” Facebook’s vice-president of partnerships Dan Rose told Variety.It’s a big step forwards for Facebook, which behind the scenes has been encouraging media companies, YouTube multi-channel networks (MCNs) and individual celebrities to upload more videos directly to the social network, rather than just post links to YouTube videos.While a number of these companies and creators have been experimenting with Facebook’s native video features, others have been cautious, on the grounds that they do not want to risk cannibalising their YouTube income until Facebook also has a way for them to make money directly from viewing.If Facebook’s initiative is a success, the range of partners is wide: from traditional TV companies through to YouTube stars and MCNs, sports leagues and perhaps even music companies.On the latter front, it seems unlikely to be a coincidence that as news broke of Facebook’s trial, The Verge was reporting thatthe social network is in “very early stages” of talks with major labelsabout expanding its music activities. Offering an ad-supported alternative to YouTube and Vevo for music videos would fit the bill.Some companies may need more than the promise of advertising revenues to start uploading more videos to Facebook.In early Junethe boss of MCN Fullscreen took Facebook to taskfor the regular appearance of his network’s videos on Facebook, uploaded by other parties without its permission.Related:Youtube could be 'eclipsed' if Facebook video tackles piracy - Fullscreen boss“I love FB video but getting very tired of seeing our videos ripped there with no way to monitor or monetize,” tweeted George Strompolos.“I now regularly see our videos with 50MM+ view counts that are stolen by individuals on FB... sometimes by other media cos... Frankly I’m shocked that a rights holder with deep pockets has not sued yet.”YouTube has a system called Content ID to help companies identify when their copyrighted content is being used in user-uploaded videos, and then choose to either leave those videos alone, block them, or leave them up but make money from the advertising around them.“YT’s content ID system is the right idea for FB, but it requires monetization (claiming) to keep content from being removed all the time,” wrote Strompolos.With Facebook now putting monetisation in place, it may face pressure to also develop a system for identifying ripped videos.
It’s Thursday everyone!
I work for a university and do quite a lot of travelling. I need reading glasses for small fonts, and consequently struggle with small laptop screens. I would like a large-screen laptop and wonder if you could recommend one. My priorities are a large good-quality screen and portability.GeorgeYou are correct in thinking that if you display the same image on a bigger screen, everything will look bigger, though it won’t be quite as sharp. (There will be fewer pixels per inch.) Unfortunately, the bigger the screen, the less portable the laptop.Happily, there are several ways to make Windows laptop screens more readable – see below. All of them can be used with screens of all sizes. Try them on laptops around your home or university to see if you really need a bigger screen. Do the experiments under new accounts, so your changes won’t affect anybody else. You can delete the test accounts when you have finished.Hardware choicesThe biggest normal laptops have 17.3in screens, and are not very portable. TheHP Pavilion 17-f254na(£449) andDell Inspiron 17 5000 Series(£514.80) are reasonably-priced options – both have 1600 x 900 pixel screens – but I’d go for theHP Envy 17-k251na(£799.95), which has a 1920 x 1080 screen. I’d still recommend against travelling with anything that big, unless it only has to be transported from the boot of a car to a desk.Fortunately, there are plenty of portable Windows laptops with screens from 13.3in to 15.6in. The 13.3in models are generally designed for mobile use while the 15.6in ones are not. I think a 14in screen could be an attractive compromise between size and portability. TheLenovo U330 Ultrabook(£599.95) might be a good option. The Lenovo Flex 2 (£349.99with 500GB or£379.85with 1TB) is a cheaper but less robust alternative. Both have 14in 1366 x 768 screens. There are lots of alternatives if you shop around.If you feel you need a bigger 15.6in laptop with a 1366 x 768 screen, the hundreds of options include theAsus X555LA(£469.11), and theAcer Aspire V3-572PG(£599.99). But theHP Envy 15-k250na(£649.95) might be worth a look, even though the screen resolution is 1920 x 1080.Nowadays, most PCs on sale run Windows 8.1, though Windows 7 may offer more control for users with poor vision and other disabilities. However, it should be worth upgrading to Windows 10.Screen resolution and scalingThe most common screen resolution on Windows laptops is 1366 x 768 pixels. In theory, you could buy a better (very high resolution) screen and set it to a lower resolution, but this doesn’t work well. LCDs work best at their “native” resolution. Other resolutions can result in fuzzier text, which is harder to read.Also, a higher-resolution screen should make everything look sharper. However, this depends on programs being able to stretch or “scale” to fit. Apple’s iPad does this better than anything else I know. But while things are improving, Windows and quite a few Windows programs still don’t scale that well.Either way, you can still make Windows’ elements bigger by using its built-in scaling. To do this, right click on the desktop background in Windows 7 and choose “Screen resolution” from the menu. Next, click on the text that says “Make text or other items larger or smaller”. This brings up a screen that lets you set scaling. Typical options are smaller - 100% (default); medium - 125%; and larger - 150%. Set the one you like best. In Windows 8.1, right-click and select “Personalise” and then “Display”.ZoomingAnother good way to make text larger or smaller is to use the Control key with the plus and minus keys – or hold down the CTRL key and use a mouse’s scroll wheel to get the same effect. This very useful feature is common in web browsers and some related programs. It’s not a standard feature in Windows.Microsoft Word and other programs also have their own zoom controls. You can type in a magnification factor, such as 127%, to make text look larger, or use a slide control. Optical zooming is easy if you don’t have to reflow the content to fit the screen.You can also zoom text using Windows’ built-in magnifier. Run it by hitting WinKey+ or by typing mag into Windows 7’s Start menu or the Windows 8.x Start screen. The Windows 7 Magnifier is more convenient as a rectangular magnifying glass that follows the cursor. You can also dock it to one of the four sides of your screen. The Windows 8.x Magnifier is different enough to confuse people: the whole screen becomes a magnified version of a much larger desktop. (In the default 200% Magnifier view, your Windows 8 screen becomes four times as big, but you can only see a quarter of it at once.)Of course, in Windows 8 you can use “pinch to zoom” with a touch screen, and you can add even more features withTouchZoomDesktop(which I have not tried myself).Many touchpads offer multi-touch zooming, too. You can enable or disable these features via the mouse or touchpad utility in the taskbar’s notification area, or in the control panel. You can find the settings by typing mouse into Windows 7’s start menu or the Windows 8.x start screen.If you get stuck, Windows has an Ease of Access Center, summoned by WinKey-U in both Windows 7 and 8. This provides Magnifier, Narrator (screen reader), on-screen keyboard and High Contrast controls. Microsoft also has a help page forAccessibility in Windows 7and aGuide for Individuals with Vision Impairmentsin Windows 8.Tougher problemsFor users with very poor vision, AiSquared offersZoomText, which is sold by a number ofEuropean dealers, includingSight &amp; Sound Technology. It costs £375. Dolphin offers the rivalSuperNova Magnifier, “from £295”.There are many other add-ons and utilities for people who are more than just a bit short-sighted, but in these cases, it’s best to get professional advice. For UK readers, theRNIBis the obvious place to start, and it has a helpline on 0303 123 9999.Have you got another question for Jack? Email it toAsk.Jack@theguardian.com
Facebook has almost doubled its number of black employees, but African Americans still represent less than 1.5% of the social networking company’s 5,479 US employees, according to a report released on Wednesday.Mark Zuckerberg’s company hired 36 black employees last year out of a total headcount increase of 1,216.Facebook released the figures in its confidential 2014 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) filing after it was heavily criticised followinga Guardian report that it hired just seven black peoplein 2013.Facebook diversityThe report shows that while the number of black staff increased from 45 to 81, the proportion of black employees barely changed: ticking up from 1.06% to 1.47%. It comes despite the company declaring that “diversity is essential to achieving our mission”.The filing shows that Facebook now has black employees among its most senior positions for the first time. However, there are just two black men and one black woman among the 238-strong executive and senior management team.Over the same period, Facebook hired an additional 603 white people (72% of whom were male). The overall proportion of white employees decreased slightly from 59% to 57%.The company hired 459 Asian people, which took up the proportion up from 33% to 34%. The proportion of Hispanic employees increased from 3.3% to 3.9%. Those from “two or more races” increased from 2.9% to 3%.Facebook also made little progress increasing the proportion of female employees, 68% of its global employees are male – a decrease of 1%. Among its employees working on its core technology 84% are male, down from 85% last year.Related:Twitter employs only 49 African Americans despite diversity pledgesWhen Facebook releasedits first diversity report,Maxine Williams, its global head of diversity, said: “At Facebook, diversity is essential to achieving our mission.“We need a team that understands and reflects many different communities, backgrounds and cultures. Research also shows that diverse teams are better at solving complex problems and enjoy more dynamic workplaces. So at Facebook we’re serious about building a workplace that reflects a broad range of experience, thought, geography, age, background, gender, sexual orientation, language, culture and many other characteristics.”Inthe latest diversity report, last week, Williams admitted that “it’s clear to all of us that we still aren’t where we want to be”.“There’s more work to do. We remain deeply committed to building a workplace that reflects a broad range of experience, thought, geography, age, background, gender, sexual orientation, language, culture and many other characteristics,” she said. It’s a big task, one that will take time to achieve, but our whole company continues to embrace this challenge.”In May,Zuckerberg said: “We have the same talent bar for everyone. But we want to find a disproportionate number of candidates who are women and minorities.”
In your article (Export bar imposed on John Logie Baird archive, 30 June), the culture minister, Ed Vaizey, is quoted as saying: “Britain led the world in the development of television technology in the 1920s, all due to the pioneering work of John Logie Baird and his colleagues.”While not wishing to diminish the contribution made by Logie Baird, I think it is unfortunate that Vaizey completely omits to mention the key role played in the development of television in this country by my grandfather,Sir Isaac Shoenberg. It was Shoenberg’s vision and leadership as director of research at EMI that guided his team of gifted electronic engineers in developing the high-definition television system, which was adopted in preference over Logie Baird’s system at Alexandra Palace in 1936 and which resulted later that year in the opening by the BBC of the world’s first public television service.Despite my grandfather’s shyness, which led him to shun publicity, his work was acknowledged during his lifetime, with the award of the Faraday medal in 1954 and of a knighthood in 1962. However, with the 125th anniversary this year of my grandfather’s birth and the 80th anniversary next year of the first television transmission from Alexandra Palace, I hope that his unique place in the history of television will finally receive the wider recognition it deserves.Jane Gatrell (née Shoenberg)Sale, Cheshire• I hope someone in the government listened to Cerys Matthews’interview of Mavis Staples on BBC6 Music on 29 June. She was grateful to the Glastonbury punters of course, but most of all she was grateful to the BBC. She kept on saying so. From a thinking American’s perspective, the BBC is an utterly glorious thing. The BBC is the only broad-spectrum public service broadcasting network in the world that is devoid of advertising. To change its funding model to something more appealing to commercial interests would be an act of vandalism of historic proportions. The only possible change would be to end the licence fee and fund it from general taxation: but the BBC’s funding would have to be ringfenced and inflation-proofed, and unfortunately the British have a habit of electing governments who renege on deals (Hundreds of jobs to go at ‘leaner and simpler’ BBC, 1 July).If anyone in government disagrees with any of the above I would be fascinated to hear from them.Tim BarnesSt Peter Port, Guernsey
Minecraft developer Mojang has published the schedule for this weekend’s Minecon conference in London: its gathering of more than 10,000 fans, partners and YouTube stars.Highlights include panels and live “let’s play” sessions featuring the creators of Minecraft-focused YouTube channels Stampy, The Diamond Minecart and Captain Sparklez, as well as sessions giving a glimpse at what’s next for Minecraft.The latter includes members of Mojang and fellow games developer Telltale Games teaming up for a talk about their plans forMinecraft: Story Mode- a new “narrative-driven” game set in the Minecraft universe.Mojang staff will also host a session talking about “upcoming features” in the main game, while YouTube will run one giving advice to players who want to find their own online-video stardom through Minecraft.The Minecon schedule, which can beviewed in full here, also includes opening and closing ceremonies; a live show on the Saturday evening; a costume competition for fans; and “speedrun” sessions where players will race to complete Minecraft as quickly as possible, in front of an audience.Related:YouTube backs digital star Stampy's new Minecraft show Wonder QuestMeanwhile, Mojang’s partners - from companies running online Minecraft servers to merchandise sellers, educational tool makers and publishers - will take part in Minecon’s exhibition zone, showing off their products.Lego, Egmont and Mattel are among the exhibitors, as well as a dedicated “indie zone” for developers of other games and children’s apps.The event takes place shortly afterMinecraft passed 70m total salesacross PC and Mac, consoles and mobile devices since its launch in “alpha” form in 2009.The 10k attendees paid £129 per ticket for the conference, which is the first Minecon to take place sinceMojang was acquired by Microsoft in 2014.The event is more a celebration of the Minecraft community than a platform for major announcements about the game’s future, but Microsoft is expected to have a presence at Minecon showing off new projects such asthe version of Minecraft for its upcoming Hololensaugmented-reality headset.
Google has apologized after its new photo app labelled two black people as “gorillas”.The photo service, launched in May, automatically tags uploaded pictures using its own artificial intelligence software.“Google Photos, y’all fucked up. My friend’s not a gorilla,” Jacky Alciné tweeted on Sunday after a photo of him and a friend was mislabelled as “gorillas” by the app.Google Photos, y&#39;all fucked up. My friend&#39;s not a gorilla.pic.twitter.com/SMkMCsNVX4&mdash; diri noir avec banan (@jackyalcine)June 29, 2015Shortly after, Alciné was contacted by Yonatan Zunger, the chief architect of social at Google.“Big thanks for helping us fix this: it makes a real difference,” Zunger tweeted to Alciné.He went on to say that problems in image recognition can be caused by obscured faces and “different contrast processing needed for different skin tones and lighting”.“We used to have a problem with people (of all races) being tagged as dogs, for similar reasons,”he said. “We’re also working on longer-term fixes around both linguistics (words to be careful about in photos of people) and image recognition itself (e.g., better recognition of dark-skinned faces). Lots of work being done and lots still to be done, but we’re very much on it.”Related:Google says sorry over racist Google Maps White House search resultsRacist tags have also been a problem in Google Maps. Earlier this year, searches for “nigger house” globally and searches for “nigger king” in Washington DC turned up results for the White House, the residence of the US president, Barack Obama. Both at that time and earlier this week, Google apologized and said that it was working to fix the issue.“We’re appalled and genuinely sorry that this happened,”a Google spokeswoman told the BBCon Wednesday. “We are taking immediate action to prevent this type of result from appearing. There is still clearly a lot of work to do with automatic image labelling, and we’re looking at how we can prevent these types of mistakes from happening in the future.”Google is not the only platform trying to work out bugs in its automatic image labelling.In May, Flickr’s auto-tagging system came under scrutiny after itlabelled images of black people with tags such as “ape” and “animal”. The system also tagged pictures of concentration camps with “sport” or “jungle gym”.“We are aware of issues with inaccurate auto-tags on Flickr and are working on a fix. While we are very proud of this advanced image-recognition technology, we’re the first to admit there will be mistakes and we are constantly working to improve the experience,” a Flickr spokesperson said at the time.“If you delete an incorrect tag, our algorithm learns from that mistake and will perform better in the future. The tagging process is completely automated – no human will ever view your photos to tag them.”
The original CSR Racing game was a big hit on mobile. After its release in 2012, it quicklysped to $12m of monthly revenues– a startling amount at the time, although less so now withCandy Crush Saga having made around $3.6m a day in 2014.Still, CSR Racing motored on to 130m downloads on iOS and Android, and was a big part of the reason why social games publisherZynga paid $527m to acquire its British developer NaturalMotionin January 2014.Now under Zynga’s wing, NaturalMotion is working on two tentpole titles that it hopes will spark an upturn in the fortunes of the publisher, which never quite managed to translate its FarmVille-fuelled dominance on Facebook into mobile success on the Candy Crush / Clash of Clans scale.Related:Zynga shoots for blockbuster hit with Dawn of Titans mobile gameDawn of Titans, unveiled earlier this year as an epic war-waging strategy game with mobile-friendly battle times and controls, is one of those. Now the other has been revealed too: CSR2, which is a sequel to CSR Racing.Which explains why the Guardian is sat with NaturalMotion boss Torsten Reil as he shows off his shiny LaFerrari supercar, playing on his iPhone but projecting the game onto a floor-to-ceiling cinema screen to show off its graphics. It’s fair to say he’s in confident mood.“This is not just the best-looking racing game on mobile, but the best-looking racing game full stop – including console. In some ways, we’re going beyond the quality of console,” he says.This may sound like empty boasting – “console-quality visuals” has been an overused phrase in mobile gaming since before the app store era – but NaturalMotion’s history developing animation technology used for console franchises including Grand Theft Auto, Reil has weight behind his comments.The studio hired the former racing studios boss from console publisher Codemasters to be general manager of the CSR2 team, which includes developers and designers who’ve worked on the likes of Need For Speed, Burnout, Forza and DiRT on console.“It’s a console pipeline and console technology, but obviously a mobile game in terms of the play patterns,” says Reil, who has previously talked about his “Starbucks-line” rule of mobile development: that you should be able to play a session while waiting in the queue for a coffee.Like its predecessor, CSR2 won’t be a free-roaming racing game, or even a traditional track-based one. Both focus on drag-style racing instead, with short, sharp races where slick gear changes are the key.We don’t actually spend much time racing during the preview, partly because NaturalMotion is still working on the race visuals, and partly because Reil wants to show off his cars.“CSR2 is about building a collection of supercars: it’s not about having just one car in your workshop and racing any more, it’s about having multiple cars in the garage,” he says. “And we’re not making any compromises in terms of detail: we even have one full-time guy who just does car paints: and his background is in real-world car paints.”Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, Pagani and other manufacturers are on board, with Reil lovingly showing off various vehicles’ exteriors and interiors, and noting that each is based on the manufacturers’ own CAD data for the cars.The risk is of whizzy visuals and petrolhead-level detail over playability. “We don’t just want this to be a graphics-fest for the sake of it. We’re using the visuals to be believable. We want you to feel that this is real,” says Reil, in response, while casually popping the bonnet open to show off an engine’s finer details.NaturalMotion is also very proud of its car configurator tool – “the best car configurator in the industry: not just the games industry, but the car industry” is Reil’s view – and the way new cars roll up to your garage rather than simply appearing out of thin air when you buy them.But what about the actual racing? Many of the details are being kept under wraps – Zynga and NaturalMotion’s media campaign for CSR2 is similar to a big-budget console title, which is another pointer to how they’re presenting it.From the couple of races the Guardian sees, the graphics are certainly a big step on from CSR Racing (which was hardly shirking on that front, for its time) while the gameplay remains focused on getting a good start then nailing your gear changes.“There will be new controls and mechanics, but we are not revealing them yet,” says Reil. “It’s still about drag racing, and it’s still an arcade game at the end of the day. The believability and authenticity is the car ownership thing, but the racing is where the fun comes in.”CSR2’s social features are also under wraps for now: “Social gameplay is really important to us, but it’s not about sending tweets and spamming people on Facebook,” says Reil. “How do you play together in a meaningful way? We have some ideas...”How will CSR2 make money? In-app purchases in the main, with Reil saying all the right things about NaturalMotion’s determination not to create a cynical cash-grabber – an accusation levelled against many freemium games by critics of the sector.“We try to make our games playable entirely without paying any money, not least because the majority of people who post reviews on the app stores are playing for free, and you want a really good rating,” he says.“A rating of 4.5 stars and above is an indication that you’ve got it right, because people complain when the pinch is too high. The way the market has developed, most free-to-play games don’t pinch in a way that’s noticeable very early on.“They wait for a while before even giving people the option to spend money. It needs to be about giving people the opportunity to spend, rather than trying to force them.”Related:Words With Friends mobile game gets revamped for its fifth birthdayWhat happens with the original CSR Racing, and will players be able to bring any of their data (or cars) across to the new version?This kind of migrationwent very wrong for Zynga with its Zynga Poker franchise, when a new version angered many players, and eventually forced the company to relaunch the old game as a “Classic” title. Avoiding such a fate with CSR Racing and CSR2 is surely high on the priorities list.“We expect that CSR 1 will still have a bunch of dedicated gamers playing it, and they will have a selection of cars that they have won and paid for in the multiplayer mode. But there is also a whole bunch of people who are now ready to play the next game,” says Reil.“That, initially, is going to be the bigger audience, we think. Will CSR 1 players be able to bring anything across? We’re not ready to talk about that either, but it makes sense for there to be some continuity.”CSR2 will soft-launch in a few countries in the coming weeks, before making its full debut on iOS and Android later in the year.
I’m having one of those days...
The BBC really doesn’t like theright to be forgotten. Director of editorial policy, David Jordan, hastermedit “unsearching – an ugly word for an ugly process”. Big data advisor, James Leaton Gray,saysit makes him nervous. And now Neil McIntosh, managing editor of BBC Online, hasrepublisheda list of 182 BBC links that have been partially obscured by Google over the past year, after Europe’s highest court commanded Google to start respecting European data protection law.Crucially, the BBC links are not removed from Google or the web, as McIntosh’s post misleadingly implied. Instead, as Googlecorrected, they are only delisted in a very selective way - from top search results on particular individuals’ names, where those individuals have made a solid case for obscurity.They are a modestcorrectionagainst failures in algorithmic prioritisation on the indelible web. Before the requests go to the BBC, individuals must prove to Google – which hasevery interestin rejecting their claim – that the links contain personal information that is inaccurate, irrelevant or out of date, and holds no public interest.Related:Google must be more open on 'right to be forgotten', academics warn in letterMcIntosh wrote that the decision to republish the links was “primarily as a contribution to public policy”, made out of concern for the “integrity of the archive”. It is an important move, from a weighty institution. But it needs to be viewed with considerable caution.Placed in its proper context, as representing a tiny proportion of right to be forgotten requests (182 out of more thanone million links), the BBC’s list – and the media’s response to it – only accentuates the demand for data protection rights. It mandates a much richer public debate, and deeper introspection from the media, than we’ve seen to date.The ‘man bites dog’ problemThe reaction to McIntosh’s post was predictable, inaccurate and devastating. The Timesled with“BBC lists stories on abusers and rapists hidden under ‘right to be forgotten’”, gratuitously highlighting two stories.The first was a 12-year-old story about a settlement between an alleged rape victim and the Catholic church, over incidents that occurred a half-century ago. The long-deceased abuser clearly couldn’t have filed the obscurity request with Google – leaving, rather less salaciously, the victim.The second case concerned a nanny jailed for child abuse. Even a cursory Google search coupled with the basics of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act would have told the journalist that an unspent conviction for such an offence clearly denied any reasonable claim to delisting. Caution raised, a bit more searching would have revealed the truth: that the conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal. That former nanny has been exculpated under the law of the land – but not by Google and not, it seems, by the press either.Other publications followed suit. Boing Boingdrew attentionto a rape story. Given it concerned a fairly recent conviction in 2012, clearly the sex offender has no entitlement to be delisted.Acquittals and people moving on with their lives are boring – they are not newsBut what about his friend who was also named in the article because he happened to be in the house where the attack took place? His Google page is now plastered with the incriminating word ‘rapist’, albeit in reference to his convicted friend. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on his part, does he not have a right to be forgotten in this context?These examples shine a light on the very problem that the right to be forgotten in part addresses, even if only imperfectly (other solutionscould have been, and should still be, explored). Journalistic logic is curiously asymmetrical. “Dog bites man” is not news; “man bites dog” most certainly is. Similarly, arrests are more newsworthy than exculpations.If the former nanny, or the rapist’s friend, are otherwise unremarkable, publication by a reputable press outlet will rocket to the top of their results, and effectively stay forever. Acquittals, and people moving on with their lives, are boring – they are not news, and they are rarely reported with the same intensity as crimes, arrests and convictions. And court records are often not online or readily searchable.Related:How Google determined our right to be forgottenSo what’s the result, in the imperfect mirror of reality that is the web? Next time you search for these people – or a potential employer or possible date does, as we all do – these results come up.Compounding damage in an age of public shamingThe BBC is not the first publication to republish links, hazarding collateral damage, and undermining data subject’s rights. Wikipedia is maintaining a public list, and the Daily Mail and Telegraph have consistently republished requests – even going so far as to rewrite new stories about them, directly undermining and compounding the challenge of complainants and other parties, often in an entirely unfair manner.This is not some inherent or natural consequence of the web - theStreisand effectbeloved of cyber-libertarians. It is deliberate journalistic choice that causes public shame, and has not meaningfully contributed in any way to better policy making. It looks petulant, not constructive. And in some cases, it deceptively withholds crucial details, like certain Telegraph stories that have been republished, without also identifying that the original story has been modified simultaneously to remove the complainant’s name. So much for transparency.Post-Leveson, the British press has a potent vitriol for anything it deems a limitation or restriction on its freedomHere, it is worth noting that the British press is an outlier in Europe. No other countries have been republishing requests. Post-Leveson, the British press has a new, potent vitriol for anything it deems a limitation or restriction on its freedom. There is also a strong tinge of Euroscepticism about rights emerging from the cultural sensibilities of continental Europe.But some healthy British humility wouldn’t go astray here. In many countries, the press only publishes partial names on stories concerning accused criminals. In others, archives and official bulletins are delisted from Google as a rule, to prevent situations like those that are traced in the quiet pathos of those dull BBC links.What a more constructive press approach looks likeBurrowing further into the BBC’s own policies reveals considerably more sensitivity to the issues at stake, and suggest that the organisation’s petulance is a result of being disempowered in Google’s delisting process, rather than a more fundamental objection to individual interests.The BBC’s detailed guidelines include a willingness to consider small modifications, such as the pseudonymisation of an abuse victim’s name, which, ultimately, is all that a lot of people are requesting.However, the idea expressed by the BBC that the entire archive should be completely and timelesslyaccessible through search interfaces (as opposed to available, through the BBC front page, which it most certainly should be, and will continue to be), shows an unwillingness to engage with the required nuance regarding the dangers of the internet’s perpetual present, and removal for lesser reasons than harm. No one here is burning archives.The BBC is unwilling to engage with the required nuance regarding the dangers of the internet’s perpetual presentA salutary contrast with the BBC here is the British Library’s measuredresponseafter the European ruling, clearly rejecting the inapt book-cutting, or library-burning,analogieserected by opponents of the right to be forgotten, and stating, simply, that it is unlikely to affect the Library’s practices, but they are keeping a watching brief.At present, press outlets like the BBC have lavished praise on Google for notifying it of delisted articles. This is partially because of a perceived threat to the ongoing availability of notifications, given that the chief body of European regulators have advised that this should be a selective practice only, rather than routine.What regulators are concerned about is precisely what the BBC has done - republication, and ready reidentification, of complainants in a way that directly undermines their demand for practical obscurity, not notoriety, on old or irrelevant personal information. But the regulators’ solution of dramatically reducing notification is clearly inadequate. Far better is to make earlier, more robust, more informed, productive and considerate contact between Google and the press.As a litmus test of the societal response to how we deal with the digital traces of our lives, the story of the right to be forgotten over the last year has been a rather sorry tale. The BBC, in republishing this list and misjudging even the most basic details, does little to assure that the debate has advanced. It would do better to agitate for a robust and confidential pre-decision procedure with Google to assure that good decisions are made in the public interest.And if the BBC is really interested in public policy, then let’s have a deep debate about the public interest itself, about the role of archives, and about information retrieval and sedimentation that is appropriate to our digital present.Dear Google: open letter from 80 academics on ‘right to be forgotten’
Politicians aren’t particularly renowned for a strong game on social media. Whether it’sfalling for parody accounts,tweeting their own names, or, er,offering free owls for all, it’s not often they get it right.Enter the Greeks. Never before has a government embroiled in one of the biggest global economic crises been so good at tweeting. We hearPresident Coolidge, for instance, was always screwing up his mentions.Not so with Greek prime ministerAlexis Tsiprasand his finance ministerYanis Varoufakis.There is no better place to follow the ebb and flow (and by which I mean the never-endingsnafu) ofSyriza’s colossal fight with its creditors than the feeds of the key Greek players.

Both he and Varoufakis are keen #hashtaggers, occasionally favouriting their own praise or sass directed at their creditors.Or, in Varoufakis’ case, a 2011tweetwhich reads simply “Here we go”, posted by an account with an avatar featuring Brad Pitt in Fight Club.Even Varoufakis’ responses carry a sense of drama.@SeresserynoserA question pregnant with contempt for democracy...&mdash; Yanis Varoufakis (@yanisvaroufakis)June 26, 2015Rather brilliantly, however, noticing the traction the Greek side is gaining on social media – and we fully imagine Tsipras at the negotiating table, chair pushed back, checking his mentions – troika members have hit back.In particular, European Commission presidentJean-Claude Junckerhas been tweeting frequently.

Twitter employs just 49 black people out of a total US workforce of 2,910. The tiny number of African American staff – 35 men and 14 women – represents just 1.7% of Twitter’s US staff.The Rev Jesse Jackson, president of the Rainbow/Push Coalition, who has long campaigned for tech companies to be more transparent about their lack of minority employees, told the Guardian that black people are “becoming intolerant” of Facebook and other Silicon Valley companies’ lack of progress in making their offices more diverse.The stark lack of black employees comes despite the company’s repeated pledges to make its staff better reflect the diversity of its 302 million users – and as Twitter actively exploits its large number of minority users to bring in more advertising revenue.Twitter demographicsAfrican Americans account for 13.6% of the US population, according to the 2010 US census, and Pew Center Research shows that black people use Twitter disproportionately more than white people.Announcing aplan to “build a Twitter we can be proud of” last year, Twitter’s vice-president of diversity and inclusion, Janet Van Huysse, said: “We are committed to making inclusiveness a cornerstone of our culture.”At the time, Twitter released brief statistics about its employees’ ethnicity. The company has subsequently quietly released its Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) report, a legally mandated filing with theUS Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that shows the exact numbers of people of different ethnicities across all ranks of the company.The 2014 report, the latest filed, showed that 93.8% of employees were white or Asian, with just 180 people out of a total workforce of 2,910 being drawn from other minorities. There were just 49 black members of staff, 68 Hispanics or Latino workers, 47 of “two or more races”, 13 native Hawaiians or other Pacific islanders, and three American Indian or Alaskan natives.Twitter’s lack of minority employees contrasts starkly with the rainbow nature of its users. Data fromthe Pew Research Centershows that 27% of black adults and 25% of Hispanics use Twitter, compared to just 21% of white people.“I am very disappointed,” Jackson said. “Black people are greater users of the product and capable of doing the jobs, but there has not been an adequate commitment to hire, train and maintain [black people].“Some people call it ‘Black Twitter’ because we over-index so much, but they still don’t hire more black people. We are becoming intolerant with these numbers, there’s a big gap between their talk and their implementation.”Jackson said Twitter “should set a timetable to make their workforce look like the market place, and a commitment to make the board of directors more diverse”.He said that at the moment, Twitter is benefitting from black people’s love of its medium – which often leads to black issues trending worldwide – without paying enough back to the community. “They hire people they know, they trust and like,” Jackson said. “We’re not in that the circle.”Arisha Hatch, managing director at Color of Change, a group campaigning for a more equal society, said Twitter and other tech companies had “really failed” in their attempts to make their workforces better reflect their customers. “It is really troubling that Twitter has so few black people, especially black women,” she said.“It appears that the tech companies seem to treat it as a public relations issue rather than addressing the actual problem. African Americans use social media more than others, the corporations continue to build and profit from that, so it is especially problematic that they do not have an employee base that in any way reflects its users. They have really failed on this.”Despite appearing to do little to increase the diversity of its employees, Twitter is actively exploiting its large number of minority users to secure more advertising dollars. The company has appointed a “multicultural strategist”, Nuria Santamaria, tasked with helping advertisers directly target Twitter’s minority groups.In acolumn for marketing website The Drumlast week, Santamaria said: “These are changing demographics that our advertisers are aware of – just facts that they can’t ignore. They need to be able to focus on these consumer groups to be successful today and to be relevant in the future. That’s an important focus for advertisers, and by default it has to become an important focus for Twitter as well.”“Advertisers know that multicultural consumers are over-indexing on mobile use and digital video consumption as well, so the combination of those two things is very powerful,” she added.A spokeswoman for the company said: “Twitter has a very vibrant and demographic user base and as a company, we help advertisers connect with their target market, whether it be moms, millennials, teens, the multicultural population, or any other demographic.”Twitter’s ethnic make-up is likely to have changed since the 2014 filing. A fresh EEO report will be filed some time this year.Twitter has set up six employee groups to promote diversity:Blackbirds(African diaspora),Alas(Latino and Latin American descent),Swat(Super Women at Twitter),WomEng(women in engineering),TwitterOpen(LGBTQA) andWomenUX(women in design).The Blackbirds Twitter account, which says its goal is to “empower employees of color at Twitter and advocate for community enrichment”, has just 2,766 followers and last posted a tweet on 7 May. The Alas account has even fewer followers: 659.As well as lacking in ethnic minorities, Twitter also lacks gender diversity, with its workforce being 70% male. Among its core technology employees, 90% are male and just eight out 37 (or 21%) of executives and senior leaders are female. Of that top leadership team, 21 out of 37 (or 57%) are white men.Gender and racial diversity is weak across Silicon Valley tech firms, withFacebook found to have hired an additional seven black people(including just one black woman) out of an overall headcount increase of 1,231 in 2013. Just 2% of Facebook’s staff are black, 4% hispanic, 3% of “two or more races”. Fifty-five per cent are white and 36% Asian.Google has only 2% black and 3% Hispanic employees, with 60% being white and 31% Asian. Seven out of 10 Googlers are male.
I’ve always loved music. I used to spend hours making cassette compilations so I could play my CD singles in the car. Yes, this was another time (and indeed another place). Tapes were replaced by MiniDiscs (stop laughing please), then I joined the iPod generation.But I never really became a committed iTunes buyer, so when Spotify came along it was something of a revelation. Read about a new artist or a new album from a band I already know, go to Spotify and listen to it, all for no additional cost above the £9.99 a month I already pay. Repeat ad nauseam. Finding the time to listen to everything I’d like to is the real problem.Related:Apple Music launches to take on Spotify – and traditional radioSo after three happy years as a Spotify user on my iPhone, I am most definitely a streaming convert. Aware that downloads from its iTunes store are starting to sink, Apple is also angling for a bite of the streaming market. So how does Apple Music compare with Spotify?After downloading the iOS update on Tuesday afternoon, the initial setup process for Apple Music is reasonably straightforward. The red Music icon on my iPhone is now white, with a hint of colour, and beyond that users are asked to select a few genres they like. I select dance, pop and electronic – and then a few artists (Hot Chip, Depeche Mode, Basement Jaxx, Robyn – you get the idea).Those selections drive the suggestions served up inFor You– one of the five options in the app. As well as albums (Roisin Murphy, Daft Punk, Jamie xx are among those offered up), there are also curated playlists such as Waking Up Gently, Electronica For Non-Electronica Fans and Girls Aloud: Deep Cuts.Girls Aloud on Apple Music.Photograph: GuardianWhile I am not ashamed to say I am something of a Girls Aloud fan, frankly even I’m surprised someone at Apple bothered to pull together a list of B sides and obscure album tracks.Neither will I be putting Cheers to the Freakin’ Weekend playlist on heavy rotation, given that it includes Macklemore, Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F) by Katy Perry and a NSYNC track I’ve never heard of.An Apple Music playlist based on a Rihanna track.The next button isNew: unsurprisingly the top offering is Freedom, the new track from Pharrell Williams that is an Apple Music exclusive; other panels include new music, hot tracks; recent releases; new artist spotlight; top songs and – quite a nice touch - music videos. Yes, I would quite like to watch the video for Shine by Years and Years, thank you very much.The section is more attractively presented and considerably more comprehensive than the Browse area of Spotify, which has charts, new releases, discover, and dozens of playlists under “genres &amp; moods” such as party, workout and dinner.The radio button takes users toBeats 1, and other “stations” – mostly automated feeds but also some real broadcasters such as the BBC World Service.The fourth button,Connect, takes users to an Instagram-esque feed where the artists they follow can post snaps and comments – such as this peach from Giorgio Moroder.Giorgio Moroder gets playful on Apple Music.So finally, the section of the app users are likely to tap the most isMy Music. It’s been a bit of a trip down memory lane given that the few songs I have bought on iTunes over the years are there, along with some I know I have not. Must be something to do with iTunes Match I assume – all slightly confusing.Like Spotify, it’s possible to listen to tracks offline, which will appeal not just to Tube users in London but anyone who doesn’t have masses of mobile data to use up, or can’t get a decent internet connection while driving or in the gym.I chose Taylor Swift’s 1989 album as the first to listen to offline, given that it’s not on Spotify. The only niggle is that there is no icon to tell me it’s available offline, whereas Spotify uses a green arrow next to do so.Apple Music also decided to stop playback when I regained a mobile signal after emerging from the Tube last night and again this morning. But I’m being picky, I know.If I did not already have dozens of playlists in Spotify I would probably cancel my subscription and switch to Apple Music. Spotify isn’t perfect and its user interface has some annoying quirks, but I’m used to them now. Will I stay tuned to Spotify? Probably, but I’ll use both during my three free months with Apple Music and then decide.Given that there is no free tier on Apple Music, unlike Spotify, it will be interesting to see how many keep paying after the three-month trial ends.
Besides virtual reality, laser-toting satellites and artificial intelligence, what other futuristic technologies is Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg interested in? Oh, you know, telepathy.“One day, I believe we’ll be able to send full rich thoughts to each other directly using technology. You’ll just be able to think of something and your friends will immediately be able to experience it too if you’d like,” wrote Zuckerberg during hislatest online “townhall Q&amp;A”.For some people, Facebook’s interest in telepathy will be part of a bold new world for digital communications.Related:Facebook successfully tests laser drones in UK skiesFor others, it’ll be the latest spur to build an ark and fill it with tin-foil hats ready for the endtimes: if the social network ever does work on this technology, it will face important questions about how it handles the resulting data, from protecting it from surveillance agencies to ring-fencing it from advertisers.Zuckerberg proved unafraid to tackle questions about Facebook’s long-term ambitions during the Q&amp;A, including the company’s interest in artificial intelligence.“Most of our AI research is focused on understanding the meaning of what people share,” wrote Zuckerberg, citing examples including detecting when a photo has a certain friend in it and making sure they see it, or using people’s photos and posts to connect them with likeminded Facebook users.“In order to do this really well, our goal is to build AI systems that are better than humans at our primary senses: vision, listening, etc.For vision, we’re building systems that can recognise everything that’s in an image or a video. This includes people, objects, scenes, etc. These systems need to understand the context of the images and videos as well as whatever is in them.For listening and language, we’re focusing on translating speech to text, text between any languages, and also being able to answer any natural language question you ask.”Zuckerberg expanded on his thoughts on artificial intelligence in a later answer about how Facebook sees itself in a decade’s time.“We’re working on AI because we think more intelligent services will be much more useful for you to use. For example, if we had computers that could understand the meaning of the posts in News Feed and show you more things you’re interested in, that would be pretty amazing,” he wrote.“Similarly, if we could build computers that could understand what’s in an image and could tell a blind person who otherwise couldn’t see that image, that would be pretty amazing as well. This is all within our reach and I hope we can deliver it in the next 10 years.”Zuckerberg also talked about Facebook’s investment in virtual reality, via its $2bn acquisition of startup Oculus VR, which will launchits headset in early 2016.“We’re working on VR because I think it’s the next major computing and communication platform after phones,” wrote Zuckerberg.“In the future we’ll probably still carry phones in our pockets, but I think we’ll also have glasses on our faces that can help us out throughout the day and give us the ability to share our experiences with those we love in completely immersive and new ways that aren’t possible today.”VR is one way Zuckerberg would like to see news organisations delivering “more immersive content” beyond text, photos and 2D videos.With Facebook emerging as a new gatekeeper for news – most recently with the launch of its Instant Articles program – he was questioned by Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington about Facebook’s role.“Making sure news organisations are delivering increasingly rich content is important and it’s what people want,” he wrote.“On speed/frequency, traditional news is thoroughly vetted but this model has a hard time keeping us with important things happening constantly. There’s an important place for news organizations that can deliver smaller bits of news faster and more frequently in pieces. This won’t replace the longer and more researched work, and I’m not sure anyone has fully nailed this yet.”Responding to a similar question from journalism professor Jeff Jarvis, Zuckerberg outlined how he sees Facebook’s role.“When news is as fast as everything else on Facebook, people will naturally read a lot more news. That will be good for helping people be more informed about the world, and it will be good for the news ecosystem because it will deliver more traffic,” he wrote.‘Real names make users safer’Zuckerberg also fielded a question about Facebook’s policy on making people use their real names rather than pseudonyms – something highlighted recently whenjournalist Laurie Penny was banned from the social networkfor using a pseudonym to avoid being trolled with rape and death threats.Facebook’s chief executive defended the company’s policy, with a claim that real names keep users safer:“There are plenty of cases – for example, a woman leaving an abusive relationship and trying to avoid her violent ex-husband – where preventing the ex-husband from creating profiles with fake names and harassing her is important. As long as he’s using his real name, she can easily block him.”Related:Seven things we learned from Facebook's latest financial resultsThe flipside of this, of course, is whether the woman leaving an abusive relationship and being harassed by an ex-husband might want to use a pseudonym, but Zuckerberg did not address this aspect. He did stress that Facebook does not want to force people to use their legal names.“Real name does not mean your legal name. Your real name is whatever you go by and what your friends call you. If your friends all call you by a nickname and you want to use that name on Facebook, you should be able to do that,” he wrote.Zuckerberg added that the company is working with the transgender community – which includes other prominent critics of the real-name policy – on refining its policies.
First-person shooters are rarely ever about the person. We may view the ceaseless slaughter through the eyes of the lead protagonist but we rarely get a sense of them as a physical presence in the game world. They are a visual consciousness attached to a gun and a health gauge.Mirror’s Edge was different. Built by Swedish studio EA Dice between the second and third generations of its multimillion-selling Battlefield titles, it made the body and experiences of lead character Faith Connors central to the action. Set in a stylised futuristic dystopia, the game mixed parkour exploration with the narrative of a paranoid chase movie, turning the city into a tense gymnastic playground, its soaring white towers a mere backdrop to the physicality of the avatar. While running, we could see Faith’s arms and legs on screen, the camera jogged as she sprinted and leapt. It was a strange and thrilling simulation of embodiment. It was flawed but beautiful.The original Mirror’s Edge had a striking aesthetic and lots of great ideas, but some poor collision detection and a sketchy narrative held it backPhotograph: Electronic ArtsSeven years after that game’s release, EA Dice is preparing a follow-up, cryptically entitled Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. “It’s more of a reboot than anything else,” explains EA Dice general manager, Patrick Bach. “We call it the origin story. We keep what the first game was all about, but we’ve allowed ourselves to remaster it from the core out. Some of the promises weren’t realised; we wanted to build a game that felt truly free and open.”In Catalyst, then, you’re once again inhabiting an architecturally beautiful fascist state, where citizens are sublimated into a machine like system of computerised surveillance. Fitted with augmented reality contact lens computers that overlay their vision with scrolling propaganda messages, inhabitants are told that “personal freedom comes at a price”.Released from jail, Faith quickly re-joins the Runners, an underground network of cat burglars and couriers, who traverse freely across the city’s skyline. Here she discovers a growing struggle against the city’s powerful regime and its ruler, the mysterious Gabrielle Kruger – of which she will become a key part. Meanwhile, a rebel group known as Black November, branded as terrorists by Kruger is growing in stature and influence.Faith finds herself becoming the ‘catalyst’ in a growing rebellion against the fascistic Conglomerate, a Big Brother-like corporate dictatorshipPhotograph: Electronic ArtsThat’s about all we know so far on the main narrative – which means it’s unclear whether we’ll see a re-run of the original plot with Faith’s sister Kate framed for murder. According to Bach, EA Dice knows that narrative was sketchily constructed, but says he wants Catalyst to be more about the world itself this time round. “The story was good but it wasn’t great,” he says. “The things you could do were too limited – we wanted to provide a feeling of what the Runners do in the world.”With this in mind, the semi-linear framework and the loading screens are gone. Players now get complete freedom to run and jump over rooftops, through service ducts and down ramps and stairways – with no loading screens. The city has opened up, while retaining the minimalist design of its predecessor, and the markers once used to signal specific piece of interactive architecture, now provide more adaptable guides, hinting at possible routes.Once again, the game is all about momentum. Players need to skilfully string together sprints, vaults and rolls to effectively traverse the city, and again, moves are contextual, with the left bumper controller upward movements like jumps and climbs and the left trigger handling downward moves like sliding under obstacles or dropping down. Straight away it feels much more seamless, and much less didactic, than the 2008 system. While traversing between buildings, potential routes are varied, but always seem clear, and there’s a nice feeling of fluidity, while you’re timing button presses correctly. It’s like playing your memory of Mirror’s Edge, or the idea of Mirror’s Edge that Dice shot for in 2008, but fell short of.This seems to have been the philosophy behind the reboot – and the reason it took so long. “Dice was proud of Mirror’s Edge, but going ahead from the first game was a bit of a struggle,” says Bach. “We’ve been working on the concept ever since the first game, but it’s only been in the last couple of years that we’ve known what we wanted it to be. I talk a lot about cleansing the concept, getting to the core of what Mirror’s Edge is. Both the technology, and the idea of what games are, are now different than what they were in 2008.“I don’t think we could have built this game on the previous generation of consoles – it takes a lot of computing power to build these worlds. We’ve been longing for the console transition to happen so we could realise this project.”Alongside key story missions, the game will also provide a range of side-quests. We played three of these at E3: a timed race to reach a specific destination (in the finished game these “dash” quests will reveal the best times achieved by your friends); an environmental puzzle where you have to hack a giant billboard so it displays a runner message, and a delivery mission with lots of combat. On that subject, there are no gun fights at all now. Instead, Faith relies on a series of acrobatic hand-to-hand moves that can be segued into the traversal system. “We wanted to stay true to the core of the game - it’s not a gimmick,” says Bach. “Picking up a gun doesn’t fit with who Faith is. It would have been easier for us to add weapons - we’re pretty good at gun play. But I don’t think that’s what Mirror’s Edge stands for.”One other intriguing element is the inclusion of asynchronous multiplayer elements. Like, say, Dark Souls, Mirror’s Edge is a primarily a single player game, but it seems there will be ways to at least communicate between participants. For example, when you hack a billboard, your replacement image may show up in the worlds of other players. Bach says EA Dice will be revealing more details later.Catalyst looks to be the project we all foolishly dreamed about when the rumours of a return first surfaced all those months ago. It is beautiful to look at, but it seems Dice has retained the original’s artsy, blank-slate look. And Faith remains a compelling physical presence, her kinetic energy translated into clever visual cues. For Bach, this is more than just a revisitation, he wants it to be the start of something much bigger.“I hope this is just the beginning,” he says. “We try not to look too far into the future because things change, and it depends on the success of this game, but of course we have ideas on how this will continue. You never know until you’re done where a game will lead you.”
The idea of access is something we think a lot about at Twitter and have since the company began. The founders thought about access in terms of a group of friends being able to instantly know what the others were up to. Whether that was moving into a new apartment in San Francisco or drinking a glass of wine in Napa Valley. For them, access was defined by immediacy and personal contact with people they knew offline.As Twitter developed and became a product of the world, access took on a more ambitious, more significant meaning. It started to represent the democratic ideal of access for all. It applied to people who didn’t necessarily know each other, who might not be in the same country, same political spectrum, or same socioeconomic condition.Thanks to the increasing pervasiveness of the internet and the growth of platforms like Twitter, access has become available at a larger scale than ever before. The United Nations’ Declaration of Human Rights states that “everyone has the freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and share information regardless of frontiers”.This may seem like an obvious statement, but throughout history there have been countless civilizations where the opposite was true. In fact, the withholding of information, the lack of access, was exactly how those in power maintained their control.Dictators decided what people should and shouldn’t know. They used propaganda to influence the population - withholding facts or selectively sharing an altered version of events. In this way, they ensured their power was not questioned, and they could keep their country isolated from the rest of the world, limiting the introduction of other opinions and beliefs.Today, people can access information from its original source, instantly. This makes it much more difficult to use information as a tool for wielding power because information is equally, immediately available. It means there are more perspectives on a news story - from mainstream media, eyewitnesses or the newsmakers themselves. It means the record can be set straight when something is reported inaccurately. And that what constitutes a news story is not just decided by a select few, but by individuals all over the world.It means that a country can hold its government to account and that it’s harder to cover up the true version of events. It won’t end the use of propaganda, of course, but giving people direct access to information, and the ability to share and discuss it openly, provides a very strong counter balance. Today, information flows freely between geographic borders, between socioeconomic groups, and among people of different belief systems.Because of the free flow of information, the people that we have access to has changed as well. If you rewind even a few years, only an elite group had direct access to world leaders or subject matter experts. The knowledge they had was shared almost exclusively with those in their immediate circles or students in their classrooms.Today, I can hear directly from people like the Prime Minister of India, most of the astronauts currently in space, or literary legends like Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood. These are people who have become the best in their fields and we now have direct access to them.People now also have increasing access to institutions. For governments and businesses this can be a scary proposition, but we see time and time again that those who embrace the idea of open access ultimately win over those who try to lock down the flow of information. A town in Southern Spain called Jun has taken this idea of open access to its furthest reaches.Following the leadership of a forward-thinking mayor, the town has integrated Twitter into every part of how the government is run. The police have Twitter handles on their uniforms and cars. The mayor answers dozens of questions each day on Twitter. Citizens link their offline identity to their Twitter account and can connect directly to City Hall and report crimes or even broken street lamps with a Tweet. Jun Mayor José Antonio Rodríguez speaks passionately about this concept of public governance and how it has removed bureaucracy and increased the accountability and effectiveness of his government.For most of history we have lived in a world with artificial barriers. Barriers to communication and the flow of information. Barriers based on status - political, racial, socioeconomic status. These artificial walls built between people limited our ability to truly see each other. They made it hard to have compassion for people living lives very different to our own. But these barriers are coming down. Access - to information, to people, to institutions - is becoming a reality for more and more people around the world.So it is critically important that we work to make this access reach even further - to more people in more parts of the world. Our commitment is that we as a company will continue to navigate an increasingly complicated political landscape. We will deal with issues at the intersection of ethics, content and technology that have not been confronted before. We will make difficult decisions every day to ensure that as many people as possible have access, and that the smallest voices in the world can be heard.And what we ask of you is that you use this access responsibly and with empathy. Use it to to shine a light on what’s good in the world and what needs to be changed, to champion the underserved, to embrace people’s differences, and amplify the best of humanity.Dick Costolo has been CEO of Twitter since October 2010. He stands down on 1 July.
“All right man, we’ve gotta kick this whole thing off at some point.”Uttered just after 5pm UK time on the world’s first global, 24/7 radio station, Zane Lowe’s characteristically conversational opening bon mot might have found itself committed to history books, had listeners who tuned in early not heard 45 minutes of Brian Eno’s Music For Airports punctuated by Lowe and his producer wrestling with the studio equipment. Instead, the first words the Guardian hears on Beats 1 are: “Check! Check! Check!”Lowe’s former Radio 1 listeners will not have been surprised by what followed: by the end of the first song – Spring King’s City – the ebullient broadcaster was singing along. That wasn’t the only familiar sound: Lowe’s former ”hottest record” slot is now called “the world record”. The first was an exclusive from Pharrell Williams, which Lowe claimed Williams supplied “out of the kindness of his heart” (Pharrell Williams also has a show on Beats 1).Lowe played that Pharrell track twice in a row, a likeable gimmick he employed with select tunes on his old radio show, but it was strange to hear him explain to an international audience that “this is what I do”. It was rather endearing to this familiar, expert broadcaster also tell new listeners “I come from Auckland, New Zealand”, like a kid on his first day at big school.In musical terms, the first hour of Lowe’s show was almost identical to his old slot, so there were few concessions to the less clued-in listeners who routinely put more commercial music at the top of Apple’s iTunes chart. Nashville band Bully’s single Trying was introduced as being ideal “if you love Wolf Alice” – Wolf Alice being a band who only released their debut album last week, and remain below the radar of most iTunes users.Related:Apple Music streaming service and Beats 1 radio launch day – as it happenedSo while Radio 1, whose controllers pride themselves on their specialist output, might feel slightly wary of Beats 1, there seems little on the schedule to worry a mainstream station such as Capital FM for now, at least. The first listeners Lowe welcomed to the show were “the early adopters”. Beats 1 is itself experimental: if it proves a success, Apple will roll out further stations.“We’re Beats 1, we’re worldwide and, from now on, we’re always on,” Zane promised at the top of the show; Beat 1’s first hour on air, he added, was “not about fanfare – it’s about quality and consistency”.Nevertheless, it felt celebratory and, apart from minor streaming glitches, like real radio. For listeners in Honolulu, the sound of Lowe hollering about Royal Blood might well have been a bit much for 6am, but on a sunny late afternoon in the UK Beats 1 made a lot of sense.
7.20pmBSTOkay, while Apple Music continues to inspire or irritate you, we’re going to sign off. You can still tweet us your thoughts but I think we all need some time to crawl into a dark room and think about what’s happened here today. Thanks for the comments.7.19pmBSTHere are a few verdicts on Apple Music and Beats 1 Radio from tech commentators.The Verge’sDieter Bohnwrites:Our first impressions are that although there are some unavoidable places where you can get lost, Apple Music has pulled off the basics of what you’d expect from a streaming music service. You can find the music you want (including, yes,Taylor Swift), and if you just want Apple’s curators to help you stop being An Old who only listens to Built to Spill because he stopped paying attention to music 10 years ago, you can do that, too. I’m looking forward to finding more.Wiredpoint out that Lowe is continuing his Radio 1 habit of double-playing, and focuses on the celebrity line-up of forthcoming Beats 1 shows.The first actual exclusive Beats 1 played was Freedom from Pharrell Williams. Lowe liked the song so much he played it twice -- something he had a habit of doing over on Radio One. Williams will be hosting his own show on Beats1 called Other Tone, which will be co-hosted by Cara Delevingne. Justin Timberlake is set to be the first Other Tone guest.The most annoying things about Beats 1 are the incessant stings at the beginning, middle and end of every song that do not let you forget that you are listening to Beats 1. There were also two very noticeable glitches in the first hour that caused the audio to jump back ten seconds or so and play over. Let’s hope Apple irons out whatever caused them, as that could get annoying very quickly.The best thing about Beats 1’s first hour was the fact that Lowe played Bully’s ‘Feels Like’.Over atMashable, Christina Warren has given her verdict.Much of the Apple Music experience really is Beats Music. And this is a good thing. I always thought Beats had the best discovery mechanism of the streaming services. With live radio, human curated playlists and access to your iTunes purchase history, I’m really liking Apple Music.Will it replace Spotify for diehard subscribers? That’s a more complicated question – for now, however, the For Me section alone has made me excited about music for the first time in a long time. And that’s a good thing.Meanwhile, follow all of the Guardian’s Apple Music coverage at:theguardian.com/technology/apple-music.7.18pmBSTZane Lowe’s show is over.Thank you all for listening to our first broadcast on@AppleMusic- Now, over to@beats1live from New York City.&mdash; Zane Lowe (@zanelowe)June 30, 2015New York based British DJ Julie Adenuga has now taken over.Business Insiderhas some information for those who are unfamiliar with the DJ:In 2010, Adenuga joined London underground radio station Rinse FM. She didn’t have any prior radio experience,and freely admitted that she and her co-host Sian Anderson“didn’t have a clue what we were doing.” But this didn’t deter the duo: They would “just stop and start tunes. We had no DJ experience, but we just played the music and were talking rubbish. It worked. Luckily.”After sharing the lunchtime slot with Anderson for about a year, Adenuga took a short break,Fader reports— before returning in 2012 for the 4-7pm drivetime slot.Here’s a video of Adenuga explaining how she got started:Adenuga is one of London’s “most vital tastemakers”, according to Apple.7.12pmBSTBlink 182’s Mark Hoppus isn’t too happy about having to follow himself.apple music automatically has me following blink-182 like what the hell is this garbage smdh&mdash; Mark Hoppus (@markhoppus)June 30, 20157.04pmBSTOh.LOL!

Spotify :-/Updatedat 6.22pm BST6.18pmBSTMy colleague Stuart Dredge has written about what the launch of Apple Music means for the music industry:The Apple Music launch represents a major upheaval for Apple’s digital music business, which until now has focused on selling music downloads through the company’s iTunes Store.The store remains open, but Apple is beginning the process of migrating digital music buyers to paying a monthly subscription for access to its entire catalogue of music.The base for Apple Music was Beats Music, the streaming service bought by Apple as part of its$3bn acquisition of Dre and Iovine’s Beats Electronics companyin 2014. They, as well as Beats Music chief executive, Ian Rogers, and chief creative officer, Trent Reznor, have been prime movers in Apple Music along with longtime iTunes boss Eddy Cue.The new service’s roots go further back than that, however. In 2009, Apple bought a streaming music startup called Lala, and used its technology for the launch in 2011 of its iTunes Match cloud locker for storing music and accessing it from multiple devices.That service continues as a part of Apple Music, although its maximum storage limit will increase from 25k songs to 100k songs later in the year, as part of Apple’s iOS 9 software update.Meanwhile, Apple’s non-live radio stations made their debut in its iTunes Radio service, whichlaunched in the US in 2013, but never expanded overseas. By contrast, Apple Music will launch in more than 100 countries.Apple faces considerable competition in the streaming market which,according to industry body the IFPI, had more than 41 million paying subscribers in 2014, and a further 100 million accessing free tiers of streaming services like Spotify.That company is the largest player in the market, having recently announced that it has 75 million active users, with 20 million of them paying for its service.“We don’t really do anything else other than selling music, so we’re the most aligned with the music industry,” Spotify chief executive Daniel Ekrecently told the Guardian.Deezer claims 16 million users including 6 million subscribers, while paid-only service Rhapsody reached 2.5m subscribers early in 2015.All these companies will be trying to crack the biggest challenge in the streaming world: convincing musicians and songwriters that their model can more than make up for the decline in sales of their music both in physical and download form – with a number of artists having complained about paltry streaming royalty cheques.The streaming services’ efforts to bring them round are complicated by the fact that they do not pay artists directly, but rather the labels that represent them, and whose contracts with those creators dictate the percentage of streaming income that finds its way to them.6.09pmBSTSome of you are reporting the software update is still not available on desktops.Look, Apple.

Here is a little segment from his review:Apple has built a handsome, robust app and service that goes well beyond just offering a huge catalog of music by providing many ways to discover and group music for a very wide range of tastes and moods.But it’s also uncharacteristically complicated by Apple standards, with everything from a global terrestrial radio station to numerous suggested playlists for different purposes in different places. And the company offers very little guidance on how to navigate its many features. It will take time to learn it. And that’s not something you’re going to want to do if all you’re looking for is to lean back and listen.The service has three big strengths, in my view. First, it smoothly integrates the existing library of iTunes songs you own with the much larger catalog of music you are merely, in effect, renting. For instance, you can create mixed playlists of songs you bought from iTunes or ripped from CDs with streaming music. And you can make them all playable offline, even though they live in the cloud.Second, while the service does use some algorithms, it suggests numerous playlists, albums and songs curated by 300 human editors, based on your tastes. These curators include editors employed by Apple, and such well-known music publications as Rolling Stone, Downbeat and Pitchfork. This was a key feature of theBeats Musicservice Apple acquired last year.Third, while Apple’s $10 monthly fee per user is both standard — and for some, pricey — the company is offering a family plan that cuts the price dramatically. For $15 a month, up to six people can be subscribers, each with his or her own individual experience. There’s also a three-month free trial.4.18pmBSTA familiar screen for millions right now …The dreaded iOS downloading screen …Photograph: Mark Smith4.08pmBSTWhile we wait, here are some promotional videos from Apple for Beats 1.

That’s the same price as a Spotify premium membership - but the difference with Spotify is that you’ll be able to listen to new tracks by Pharrell Williams (whose upcoming song Freedom will be available exclusively on Apple) and anything by Taylor Swift, who famously pulled all her music from Spotify earlier this year.In fact, it was an open letter from Swift - one of the biggest selling artists on the planet - to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook a couple of weeks ago that led to the company doing a U-turn and agreeing to pay artists royalties for songs streamed during the first three months of Apple Music. (After Swift’s post, it took only hours for Apple’s head of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue to announce on Twitter: “Apple Music will pay artist [sic] for streaming, even during customer’s free trial period... We hear you [Taylor Swift] and indie artists. Love, Apple.”)After the events of this week, I&#39;ve decided to put 1989 on Apple Music...and happily so.&mdash; Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13)June 25, 2015Apple is offering a “family plan” for up to six accounts for £15/$15 a month. Spotify has something similar, but each additional user costs £4.99 a month for up to four extra users.Apple Music will also include Beats 1, a global radio station broadcast from studios in London, New York and Los Angeles. It will feature presenters including Zane Lowe and shows from the likes of Drake, Elton John, St Vincent, Disclosure and Dr Dre - who co-founded the Beats headphones business with Jimmy Iovine before the pair sold it to Apple last year. The station will be available without an Apple Music subscription.IOS users can use Siri to add new songs and albums to their Apple Music library. Owners of an Apple Watch can also sync music to it and play it – regardless of whether a paired iPhone is nearby.Apple Music is promising to help users discover new music by offering “suggestions from our experts who know and love music”. There will also be playlists on offer from Apple Music editors, as well as writers from Rolling Stone, Q, Pitchfork, Mojo, DJ magazine and Shazam.In addition, the service will offer iTunes Connect, which allows artists to set up profile pages where they can share tracks, videos and other content with their fans. The reason for this? “When musicians are free to express themselves directly to their fans, it’s a powerful thing,” Apple says.Updatedat 4.01pm BST3.48pmBSTGood afternoon, and welcome to the Guardian’s liveblog of the launch of Apple Music -the new music streaming service from Apple.The service, which launches at 4pm BST today, offers access to tens of millions of songs on demand over the internet on iOS devices - iPhones, iPads, Macs and PCs (with Apple TV and Android devices following this year).Stay with me as I try and keep you up to date with all the latest news and analysis from the first few hours of the launch.

The outgoing chief executive of Twitter has said he underestimated the pressures that going public would place on the company and warned that his successor would nevertheless have to manage an increasingly complex set of geopolitical challenges as well as the demands of Wall Street.Speaking to the Guardian before his last day at the company on Tuesday, Dick Costolo said that while Twitter had grown revenue by 97% year on year to $1.7bn (£1.1bn), the pressure placed on the company obscured its other achievements in bringing 302 million monthly active users on to the service.“When we took the company public, I had an expectation that the market would evaluate us based on our financial metrics first and foremost,” he said. “I probably would frame the way we were thinking about the future of the company differently, understanding how we were in retrospect evaluated.”Costolo said the pressures of meeting Wall Street expectations on a quarterly basis meant the company had to battle against a current of incrementalism and short-term thinking. “You always want to keep focused on the long-term vision, yet when you go public you’re on a 90-day cadence and there’s a very public voting machine of the stock price that accelerates that short-term thinking.”But he argued that Twitter had stuck to a “cohesive long-term strategy” and said there were plans to make the service more accessible during live events, whether sporting finals or breaking news.He referenced Lightning, a new set of features intended to enable better curation and promotion of live content on Twitter. “People have been asking why I didn’t do that four years ago,” he said. “Four years ago, the site didn’t even stay up. We were the only big site on the internet whose 404 [error message] was its own brand – the fail whale.”In Costolo’s five years as chief executive, Twitter has transformed from a private company with 300 staff valued at $3.7bn to a public company with 3,900 employees valued at $23.5bn.When he announced he was stepping down, he was believed to have succumbed to pressure from investors concerned about slow growth and a perception of disappointing revenues.Asked why he was leaving, Costolo said he had put together a strong team that was now being recognised outside the company. “It is the right time,” he said. “Great leaders and great CEOs are both resilient and self-aware.”He dismissed suggestions that he had set expectations too high by prioritising rapid growth in user numbers. “I have never paid attention to people externally who are saying I should do this or that.”Costolo gave the interview after a rare speech in Granada, Spain, in which he argued that Twitter had become a “product of the world” that had taken on “a more ambitious and symbolic meaning – the idea of democratic access for all.”Referring to article 19 of the United Nations’ human rights declaration, which asserts the right of the individual to “seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media”, Costolo said that throughout history withholding information had been a method of retaining power. “With billions now online, that right of access to information is a reality and Twitter allows that information from the source.”What constitutes a news story was no longer determined just by the media, he said, and while Twitter would not end propaganda, he argued that governments now found it harder to cover up the true version of events.Costolo said the job of Twitter CEO had come to involve resolving complex geopolitical issues, citing for example Iran, where authorities use the site to communicate while blocking citizens’ access.“The challenge is we can’t be excessively parochial and have an American perspective on the way things should be. We have to abide by the rule of law in the countries in which we operate, while pushing to make sure that these voices can be heard despite whoever is in power at the time.”It is an example of the non-financial measures by which Costolo argued Twitter should be judged. “As a company, we will continue to navigate this intersection of ethics and technology that has not been confronted before, and make difficult decisions every day to ensure the smallest voices in the world can be heard.”Twitter under Costolo’s leadership has been criticised for failing to crack down effectively on threatening and abusive messages, and faced pressure to block activity by terrorists trying to recruit.Costolo said efforts to discourage abusive language included tripling the size of its abuse reporting team, allowing third parties to report abuse of others and making it harder for blocked users to reopen accounts. “You have to make the cost equation less expensive for the person who feels they are being abused,” he said.He said regulation, particularly in Europe, was not an answer to the challenge, and it was not appropriate to act as if Twitter and its competitors were a type of communications utility that needed the sort of oversight imposed on broadcasters and telecoms carriers.“I will say directly that I think regulation is a threat to free speech,” he said. “I can’t think of an example where regulation didn’t have unintended consequences and I’m unable to conceive of a regulatory body that will be swift enough to deal with the constantly evolving issues of ethics, communication and technology. I just don’t think it’s possible.”Costolo’s successor has yet to be named – the company will be led on an interim basis by Jack Dorsey, the co-founder. Whoever takes on the job would have to contend with a far broader set of challenges, Costolo said. “When I took on the role of CEO I thought of myself as a technologist, but I’ve had to become more and more concerned with the geopolitical landscape, as have all my counterparts in tech.“Dealing with that landscape will be the big challenge , the different ways in which countries think about the value of open exchanges of information. I have only seen that get more complex.”
Apple has launched its Apple Music streaming service, kicking off a three-month free trial with hopes of competing with entities as varied as Spotify, broadcast radio and Facebook.Apple Music was launched for iOS devices as part of the company’s iOS 8.4 software update, which was due to go live at 4pm BST.The service will also be available for PC and Mac computers through Apple’s iTunes software, with Android to follow later in 2015.Related:Apple Music interview: 'Algorithms can't do it alone – you need a human touch'The launch represents a major upheaval for Apple’s digital music business, which until now has focused on selling music downloads through the company’s iTunes Store.The store remains open, but Apple is beginning the process of migrating digital music buyers to paying a monthly subscription for access to its entire catalogue of music.While some elements of Apple Music will be free, full access will cost £9.99 a month once the three-month trial ends, with a £14.99 option for families of up to six people.Apple’s plans not to pay royalties to labels and music publishers during that period had sparked controversy, beforeinterventions by independent labels and Taylor Swift triggered a u-turn.Apple Music has three distinct components, with the first being on-demand access to a catalogue of more than 30m songs, with paying subscribers able to store songs for offline listening.This is the direct competitor to streaming services such as Spotify, Deezer, Rhapsody, Google Play, Tidal and Rdio. Subscribers will be able to create their own playlists to share with friends via Facebook, Twitter and Apple’s messaging app, as well as listening to those created by Apple’s team.The second component is “radio”, which includes live radio station Beats 1, and will broadcast round the clock – albeit over the internet rather than the airwaves – from studios in Los Angeles, New York and London.DJs Zane Lowe – poached from the BBC’s Radio 1 earlier in 2015 – Julie Adenuga and Ebro Darden will bejoined by an array of guest DJsincluding fellow Apple employee Dr Dre, Elton John, Disclosure, St. Vincent, Pharrell Williams and Drake.Apple’s definition of radio includes streaming “stations” created by DJs based around specific genres and themes – a feature that’s already prominent on rival services, including being the core for Spotify’s recently-introduced “Now” homescreen.Despite advance speculation suggesting Apple would be making its streaming service paid-only after criticism of Spotify’s free tier, people will be able to listen to Apple’s radio for free too – although they will have restrictions on how often they can skip tracks, which will be lifted for paying subscribers.The third component of Apple Music is Apple Connect, which blends elements of SoundCloud, YouTube and Facebook. Accredited artists will be able to upload songs, videos and photos for fans who follow their profiles, as well as posting status updates and playlists.“We wanted to give artists a place where there’s a rhyme and a reason: where there’s an ecosystem where it feeds off each other. Where there’s a payoff,” veteran music executive Jimmy Iovine, who has been working on Apple Music,recently told the Guardian.The base for Apple Music was Beats Music, the streaming service bought by Apple as part of its$3bn acquisition of Dre and Iovine’s Beats Electronics companyin 2014. They, as well as Beats Music chief executive, Ian Rogers, and chief creative officer, Trent Reznor, have been prime movers in Apple Music along with longtime iTunes boss Eddy Cue.The new service’s roots go further back than that, however. In 2009, Apple bought a streaming music startup called Lala, and used its technology for the launch in 2011 of its iTunes Match cloud locker for storing music and accessing it from multiple devices.That service continues as a part of Apple Music, although its maximum storage limit will increase from 25k songs to 100k songs later in the year, as part of Apple’s iOS 9 software update.Meanwhile, Apple’s non-live radio stations made their debut in its iTunes Radio service, whichlaunched in the US in 2013, but never expanded overseas. By contrast, Apple Music will launch in more than 100 countries.Apple faces considerable competition in the streaming market which,according to industry body the IFPI, had more than 41 million paying subscribers in 2014, and a further 100 million accessing free tiers of streaming services like Spotify.That company is the largest player in the market, having recently announced that it has 75 million active users, with 20 million of them paying for its service.“We don’t really do anything else other than selling music, so we’re the most aligned with the music industry,” Spotify chief executive Daniel Ekrecently told the Guardian.Deezer claims 16 million users including 6 million subscribers, while paid-only service Rhapsody reached 2.5m subscribers early in 2015.Related:Daniel Ek: Spotify and free music will save the industry, not kill itApple Music’s launch will intensify competition in the market, including a battle to secure exclusives on big albums or artist back catalogues.Pharrell Williams is debuting his new single on Apple Musicfor launch, whileSwift is making her latest album 1989 available to streamfor the first time on it.Other artists are supporting the full range of streaming services.AC/DC made its back catalogue available to stream for the first timeon Spotify, Deezer, Rdio and other services earlier on Tuesday, and was expected to do the same for Apple Music.All these companies will be trying to crack the biggest challenge in the streaming world: convincing musicians and songwriters that their model can more than make up for the decline in sales of their music both in physical and download form – with a number of artists having complained about paltry streaming royalty cheques.The streaming services’ efforts to bring them round are complicated by the fact that they do not pay artists directly, but rather the labels that represent them, and whose contracts with those creators dictate the percentage of streaming income that finds its way to them.
Battlefield is one of the most respected military shooters of the decade, and Star Wars is a reasonably well-known science fiction film. So when the developer of the former set out to make a game based on the latter it was always going to be controversial.Ever since its official unveiling at the Star Wars Experience event in April, gamers and movie fans have worried about Star Wars Battlefront, the multiplayer shooter based on the original trilogy. EA Dice has largely weathered that storm, producing a convincing E3 demo, based around the Hoth and Tatooine levels, but we put several lingering doubts to the studio’s general manager Patrick Bach. Here’s what he had to say.Battlefront has none of Battlefield’s deeper features such as squads, classes and highly customisable load-outs.“We have a strong legacy with Battlefield, but we did not want this to be a battlefield game – we wanted it to have a heart and soul of its own. We came at it from a very different angle. We know that the core audience of a game like this is different to the Battlefield audience. There’s a crossover, but Star Wars fans expect a Star Wars game, not a Battlefield game. We looked at what Star Wars stands for, rather than asking how can we tweak Battlefield to be something else.“And, actually, we’ve received criticism both for not being enough like Battlefield and for being too much like Battlefield. We’ve had to accept the fact that people will be upset with us until they get to play it. And when people did play it at E3 almost all the negativity went away. We stayed true to what we believed in, and when people saw it, they got it, they agreed that this is a game on its own, it is not Battlefield, and they liked it.”If the single-player component is just a series of co-op and multiplayer maps filled with AI opponents, isn’t it going to lack depth and longevity?I don’t want to say, you just have to trust us, we need to prove it of course, but we’re using all the knowledge about depth and longevity that we’ve accumulated over years of making the Battlefield games. Also the missions we have in the game have more longevity than most single-player campaigns. They tend to have a length of between 6-10 hours and that’s it – most people don’t replay them, most don’t go through the secondary objectives, they run through the story and they’re done.In Battlefront, it’s very different, it has more to do with replayability than most narrative-driven single-player experiences. It gives you something else, something you may not be used to seeing. We have done a lot with this game that keeps it attractive for a longer period of time. There’s a lot of persistence work going into it – how you unlock things, how you explore new ways of playing, how you collect things and rank up, and also how you compare yourself with your friends. There are a lot of different ways to play the game. There’s a lot of variation.Why the focus on the original Star Wars trilogy only?The game is being developed and refined in collaboration with Lucasfilm, both parties agreed quite early that we wanted to create something that’s true to the Star Wars universe rather than just mixing and matching everything. So staying with episodes four, five and six felt like a reasonable approach – they’re in the same time era, so you can mix characters, vehicles and maps in almost any way without completely breaking the logic of the universe, whereas if you added the prequel era... well, you could argue it would be fun, but it wouldn’t be authentic. There are pros and cons to both approaches, but we had to stick with one, so we went deep into the classic battles of the four, five and six era.Also, there’s a movie coming out, which is episode seven, so it felt more natural to show you the things that happened just before that, rather than going back even further or mixing and matching, which wouldn’t make sense with the film.The AT-ATs aren’t pilotable and there are no space battles. Is the game going to be able to capture the epic feel of Star Wars battles?Living up to the Star Wars IP is a huge challenge – there’s an argument that you can only fail – because it’s Star Wars, right? Everyone has a keen eye on what you’re doing and they spot every mis-step. We’ve never really built [on] someone else’s IP before - and this is one of the biggest IPs in the industry. The biggest challenge has been staying true to what makes Star Wars Star Wars. The problem other Star Wars games have had is that they’ve tried to copy the output of Star Wars rather than understanding the core of what makes the movies. The Battlefront development team has tried to find the soul of Star Wars. There’s more behind it than just copying.Are there ideas that the team has kept on hold for future titles or DLC? Will dedicated space battles simply turn up later?There’s a lot of stuff we didn’t have time for, but we’ve picked the coolest moments, the ones that made most sense for multiple people playing together. One design philosophy we always have is that we want different people to play together – we want flying vehicles with ground-based troops, we want to mix and match different types of gameplay on the same map – that’s what makes a multiplayer game fun. One thing that gives a game a long tail is the ability to change your play style within the same game.
The days of big surprises from Apple are mostly in the past. As the scale of the company has grown, it has become unable to prevent leaks somewhere along its chain.That’s doubly true when dealing with the notoriously gossipy music industry, so it shouldn’t be a surprise that nearly everything about Apple Music, the company’s new Spotify competitor, was known long in advance of the service’s announcement.But there’s one big musical elephant hiding in the corner of the room: Beats 1, Apple’s new youth-oriented radio station, which starts broadcasting at 5pm BST Tuesday. There’s been no public betas for this, and so the first we’ll hear of it is when the mics are turned on – which leaves some questions unanswered.Apple Beats Music iTunes Connect 1 – what?Apple musicStrictly speaking, Apple is launching three separate music services on Tuesday, although all come under the rubric of “Apple Music”. Apple Music itself is the company’s £9.99/$9.99/€9.99 streaming music platform, intended to compete with services like Spotify and Deezer by offering an all-you-can-play choice of tracks.It’s the big-ticket item, and it’s free for the first three months – a fact that nearly got the company in hot water, since it attempted to get out of paying artists royalties for their music over that period. One intervention from Taylor Swift, however, and the firm relented.iTunes ConnectSecondly, iTunes Connect is (Apple hopes) the streaming music service’s secret weapon. It lets artists set up profile pages where they can share tracks, videos and other content with their fans. Unlike the company’s earlier foray into social networking, fans can’t (yet) use iTunes connect to talk with each other, and so a lot of the success or failure of the service will depend on whether or not artists genuinely aid music discovery, or simply use the service for self-promotion. Following Pharrell Williams to find out his favourite tracks is one thing; following him to see a playlist of his last few singles is rather less exciting.Beats 1Thirdly, though, is Beats 1. This marks the company entering new territory: a youth-oriented radio station, broadcasting from California, New York and London, and featuring a host of stars behind the mic, led by former Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe.The brainchild of Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Raznor, and staffed by a whole host of other employees poached from the BBC’s flagship music radio channel both on- and off-mic, Beats 1 is the only aspect of Apple Music that hasn’t been available to anyone willing to download the beta version of iOS 8.4.Music, interviews and chartsBut the companyhas given Rolling Stone magazine a sneak peekof the pre-recorded content for the station, which suggests an eclectic mix of programming to fill the 24-hours-a-day of broadcasting. The station will launch with shows such as Zane Lowe’s The World Record, which features one song a day the DJ will focus on, an interview-based show called Gratitude which sees an artist talk about other musicians who influenced them, and a chart show counting down the top songs of the week.Overnight, content will switch to artist-led shows, hour-long features such as St Vincent’s Mixtape Deliver Service and Dr Dre’s The Pharmacy, where the musician gets control of the decks for a period. Despite the pre-recorded nature of at least some of those, the radio really will be broadcasting as-live, and there will be no catch-up service for people who miss the broadcast.The big unknownsBut until the full channel starts broadcasting, there remain a host of unanswered questions about Beats 1. Will it remain free and ad free forever, acting as a loss-leader for the company’s music service, or will adverts sneak in to the free version once the three-month trial ends?How much of the content will be pre-recorded versus live or as-live? How will Apple adapt the style of a geographically-centred radio station such as Radio 1 into a worldwide service? Will there be audience interaction, for which Zane Lowe is known, or will it be a strictly one-way affair?And, perhaps most interestingly: how exactly will notoriously censorious Apple deal with being in charge of a youth-oriented radio station? What happens the first time an interviewee swears, says something controversial, or – horror of horrors – slates Apple itself? The channel’s due to kick off withLowe interviewing rapper Eminem, so we could find out the answer to that very soon indeed.
Amazon is launching a one-hour delivery service,Prime Now, in London, offering high speed delivery on selected items to customers in east and central London.Customers, who must be Amazon Prime subscribers, can order goods to their home or office for delivery in the next hour for £6.99.A second, free, same-day delivery option is also available, for a two-hour window later in the day. Testing by the Guardian found that deliveries were made less than an hour after the delivery was placed.London is the fifth city to get the one-hour delivery service, and the first outside the US.Over the course of its expansion, Prime Now has also broadened its scope, from an “essentials” service largely focused on grocery delivery, to one offering a substantial portion of Amazon’s catalogue.Users can pick up a copy of Taylor Swift’s 1989 album, a blender, or a Bluetooth speaker, alongside the booze, food and toiletries that had previously made up the bulk of the service.Deliveries appear to come from Amazon’s east London fulfilment centre near Abbey Mills in Tower Hamlets, and serves four east London postcodes as well as most of central London.North, South and West London are not yet included in the service, however.Same-day delivery is more than just a perk for Amazon Prime customers. It represents a growing battleground where the company is fighting against traditional retailers that are starting to use their physical stores as collection points for online orders.John Lewis’s website, for instance, offers next-day delivery to any branch of Waitrose or John Lewis, free of charge.Argos offers a same-day delivery service from more than 300 stores, with costs depending on distance and the size and weight of the goods.• Amazon trials two-hour delivery in Manhattan
“Regression to the mean” is one of the subtlest concepts in statistical literacy – and yet it’s terribly simple. In plain English, “regression to the mean” is the idea that normally, things are pretty normal. That is, if you observe something abnormal – a high fever, a high share price, a long, unseasonable stretch of sunny or rainy days – then chances are that all will soon fall back within normal range. If you’re sick, you’ll probably get better (this is why so many quack cold remedies “work” – they take your mind off the passage of time while you wait for regression to the mean to assert itself).Regression to the mean applies to commerce. An advertising technique that works very well today will probably work less well over time, as repetition and competition eat away at its novelty. Look at those “ghost ads” on the sides of faded Victorian buildings: apparently, it was once profitable to advertise soap with a slogan like “It makes you clean.”Remember when Xynga’s “social games” like Farmville seemed to colonise the limbic systems of everyone you knew, stealing away their hours with a fiendishly addictive game-mechanic? In short order, most of Xynga’s players grew inured to the game’s temptations, leaving behind a rump of especially susceptible players who were not enough to sustain the game, nor its makers’ high-flying share price.Likewise, the “surveillance business model” of building up detailed electronic dossiers on internet users in order to predict what they want to buy and how to sell it to them produced some genuinely impressive results in its early years. The serendipity of seeing an ad for something you had been thinking about proved very powerful in the early days of Facebook and the first generation of “retargeting” services.But a look at Facebook’s ad-card rates shows that the novelty of this technique wears off fast. Facebook was founded on the premise that it could use its mounting dossier on your behavior to figure out how to sell you things faster than your natural defenses would repel its pitches. If that ideology was borne out, you’d expect to see the company’s cost-per-thousand ad rates climbing into the stratosphere. Instead, they’re damned close to the rate you’ll pay for regular, minimally targeted display advertising elsewhere.The quarterly Facebook investor calls tell the story: Facebook’s growth area for revenue aren’t from predictive, targeted ads. Instead, the company is making good money from venture-backed games firms that pay “per acquisition” – from users actually installing their games. As Facebook doesn’t have to pay itself to advertise on its own service, it can simply wash its service in ads for games until the acquisitions take place. The cost per acquisition on Facebook is substantially in excess of what any game company could hope to earn from an average player, suggesting that this line of business is due for a crash.The other profitable line for Facebook is sneakier, and possibly longer-lived. The company can easily see which of the commercial/brand/business pages on its service are growing fastest. These correspond to the businesses that are exerting the most energy to get their customers to follow them on Facebook and making Facebook most integral to their daily business.When Facebook’s algorithms predict that a business is well and truly reliant upon Facebook to reach its customers, it simply switches off the business’s ability to reach those customers, so that new updates only go to a small fraction of the company’s followers. Thereafter, a Facebook salesperson gives the business a call and offer to turn the tap back on – for a price. That’s not the surveillance business-model. It’s a much older one: the drug-dealer business-model, where the first taste is free.The Big Data success stories for predicting human behavior over long terms don’t bear scrutiny. It’s not a triumph of big data to predict that someone searching for “used cars” might respond to an ad for used cars. Neither is it sorcery to predict that a woman who buys folic acid is pregnant. It’s not big data to get paid when someone clicks on a loan application or installs a game.Markets don’t solve all our problems, but they do not have much patience for an irrational, ideological commitment to techniques that don’t deliver. Facebook doubtless has internal fiefdoms that will be threatened by the company backing off its surveillance commitment, but it is also growing non-surveillance-oriented tendrils as fast as it can.Unfortunately, spy agencies aren’t subject to this kind of discipline. The fact that the billions spent spying on everyone, always, has spectacularly failed to catch any terrorists is taken as proof that they’re not doing enough surveillance – not that untargeted, mass surveillance without particularised suspicion is a waste of money.Of course, it helps that there are so many contractors and suppliers who lobby for spies to buy more of their gear and services.Every technology is overhyped at its birth.The Gartner Hype Cycle has Big Data slidinginto the long, deep “trough of disillusionment.” As the cycle astute observes, overpromising doesn’t mean there’s no there there. As big data techniques stabilise into a few applications where it works well and long, more of the surveillance business model will blow away.
They’ve been around for decades, have sold hundreds of millions of albums, but until now had not been available on streaming services.No, not The Beatles. AC/DC.After years ofrefusing to let their music be streamed, the Australian rockers have decided to make their catalogue available to existing services , including Spotify and Rdio, as well as Apple Music.AC/DC were late to the digital music party and did not put their catalogue on iTunes until late 2012.Related:Apple Music: everything you need to knowLast year’s Rock or Bust was the group’s first new album to be sold digitally. The strategy may have helped it become one of 2014’s best-sellers, shifting 2.7m copies globally.The band has sold more than 200m records in a career that has spanned more than four decades, with 1980’s Back in Black accounting for about a quarter of the total.AC/DC’s back catalogue is now on Spotify.Rock or Bust was the first AC/DC release since 2008’s Black Ice, which went straight into the album charts at No 1 in 31 countries, and has sold more than 8m copies worldwide.The group’s 17th album was the first not to feature founding guitarist Malcolm Young, 61, who is suffering from dementia.AC/DC’s move reduces the number of major acts that continue to hold out against the streaming tide.The Beatles music remains unavailable on streaming platforms, for reasons best known to the surviving members.Other refusniks include US country star Garth Brooks, and Taylor Swift. Radiohead frontman, Thom Yorke – who once called Spotify “the last desperate fart of a dying corpse” – has refused to put his solo albums on the streaming service.Taylor Swift performs in Philadelphia on her 1989 world tour.Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty ImagesSwift pulled her back catalogue from Spotify last year, objecting to the fact that not all users pay for the service. Artists are paid less for streams on the free tier.“I’m not willing to contribute my life’s work to an experiment that I don’t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music,” she said at the time.However, Swift is allowing her albums to be streamed on Apple Music, which will only be available to paying customers after the initial three-month free trial ends.
For a whole host of reasons, the start of secondary school marked a pause in my love of video games.I’d spent my childhood playing grungy classics like Crazy Taxi and Tony Hawk’s Underground. But on the cusp of puberty and thrust into a group of new personalities - most of which were much bigger and louder than mine - I did what most kids do at that difficult age and adjusted my interests according to my friend group.Had Splatoon, Nintendo’s raucous day-glo shooter, been around back then, it probably would’ve been a different story.I’d always been a tomboy. My mum’s frustration at me for refusing to wear dresses was a regular occurrence on our shopping trips, but heading into high school, I realised that the genderless oasis of childhood was coming to an end.From the cringeworthy sex education classes that warned I’d be a woman soon to the vicious rejection of girls who didn’t fit a certain mould, I knew I had to start acting differently in order to make friends. Games weren’t cool, especially for girls, and they were the first in a long line of interests I had to drop from my life for the following five years.If you were a teenager in noughties you were probably slotted into one of two dismissive stereotypes; the “emo” or the “chav”. You either listened to Linkin Park or R Kelly; you wore Converse or Nikes; you drank snakebites or WKDs.Naturally, I followed my black heart to the sound of Green Day, and stepped out daily in worn pink Cons, black skinny jeans and a black and white striped hoodie. I swiped thick black liner over my eyes and heavily backcombed my blonde-streaked hair in the vain hope that I’d look like Kiki Kannibal.Years later, Splatoon takes the MySpace scene kid aesthetic and perfects it. The core colour combination of black and neon, the slightly feminine,Pete Wentz-esque lookto Inkling Boy and the brooding back alley dealer who resembles the older brother everyone knew, who charged a pound per cigarette and a fiver per booze run.Splatoon – or, more specifically, Inkling Girl – is everything I wanted to be, and probably thought I was, as a teen; punky, offbeat and effortlessly cool (ignoring, of course, the CITV-style references to “fresh”).The sense of style in Splatoon, and the importance placed on it, takes the precious ideal of image that teens hold and makes it an integral part of the game. Being able to walk past an Inkling, spot their unusual hat and “steal” it by ordering it through the back alley dealer, evokes that strange combination of jealousy and awe that defined most of my teenage interactions.But specifically, the fashion itself strikes that delicate early millennial balance between all out goth and wasted skater dudes with muted blacks and greys highlighted by bright purples, greens and pinks.Splatoon’s ability to repurpose the entire identity of my teenage years in a way that makes sense in its strange little universe is what makes me so sure that it would’ve retained my interest in games.With its pop-punk soundtrack, it brings to mind all the bands I used to listen to from Sum-41 to Blink-182, while the industrial environments perfectly mirror the skateparks where I’d slouch about drinking warm Smirnoff Ice.Everything about Splatoon screams of the skater/punk crossover that defined that era and it’s this recognition and mirroring of my identity that would’ve made Splatoon the perfect game for my moody teenage self.In the same way as my friends and I gossiped about Big Brother and other terrible TV shows, I can see us having poured over the new content in Splatoon. We could have been discussing our favourite maps in the same way we actually discussed our favourite contestants. We should have been playfully arguing over the best weapons. The Carbon Roller or the Custom Dual Squelcher? Bluefin Depot or Kelp Dome? Bread or Rice?Games, like music, can help define who we are – it’s just that sometimes the absolutely perfect expression of ourselves arrives too soon. Or worse, too late. Splatoon may not have been a lasting game for me; it might have been as much of a fad as all those “undiscovered” MySpace bands. But it is undoubtedly a game that would’ve been considered cool.Its sense of fashion, and even the ability to share limited messages in game and stumble across the occasionalweird masterpiece,all tie into the key values that defined the post-grunge era and its emerging laboratory of social media.For all that, I would have truly treasured it.

Smartwatches are the hottest thing in technology right now. The little wrist-based screens are dragging timepieces into the 21st century and shifting the buzzing, binging and bonging of modern life away from our phones.The choice is staggering: from the high end luxury of the Apple Watch to Google’s growing army of Android Wear to the elegantly simplicity of the Pebble. But which one should you choose if you fancy joining the shift to wearables?Sony Smartwatch 3Sony’s latest Smartwatch 3 finally brings acceptable battery life to Android Wear with a comfortable, waterproof and future-proofed design.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianPrice:£130The Sony Smartwatch 3 is a square Android Wear watch with a difference. It uses a transflective LCD screen, which means it is easy to see in direct sunlight and can be read without the need for a backlight.It has a backlight though, for reading in the dark, but as it’s not needed all the time it saves power meaning the Smartwatch 3 lasts up to three days per charge even when connected to smartphone via Bluetooth.It lacks a heart rate monitor but has GPS for tracking runs without a smartphone, and is waterproof to IP68 standards – 1m of water for 30 minutes.It can connect remotely to an Android smartphone via Wi-Fi with the latest software update, is charged via a standard microUSB cable and has a choice of several custom straps including a metal one. A touchscreen makes navigation easy, and you can talk to it to ask questions of Google and dictate replies.Verdict:decent battery life, easy to read screen, but plain stylingSony Smartwatch 3 review: great design, good screen and decent batteryLG Watch UrbaneThe LG G Watch Urbane is the latest Android Wear smartwatch and the one that looks most like a regular watch yet, which is both good and bad.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianPrice:£260The latest of Google’s Android Wear watches is big, round, shiny and is the most watch-like smartwatch to date. Its waterproof, stainless steel body comes in silver or rose gold with a brushed bezel around the screen and watch faces to match.The 1.3in circular OLED screen can stay on all the time, but does not adjust its brightness to the ambient light. The watch is one of the largest available and as such its bulky body will likely only fit well on larger wrists.It runs the latest version of Android Wear and can connect to an Android smartphone via Bluetooth or remotely via Wi-Fi. Users can reply to messages using voice dictation or by drawing out an emoji on screen using a finger.It has a heart rate sensor, but no GPS, requiring a smartphone to track runs. The battery lasts for a day and a half between charges, which happens using a magnetic dock. The leather strap is a standard size, meaning it can be swapped for a regular watch strap.Verdict:big, bold and chunky won’t suit everyoneLG Watch Urbane review: big, bold and a bit gaudy in goldApple WatchApple’s first smartwatch is exquisitely made, but has a confusing, inconsistent user interface that tries to do too much all at once.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianPrice:£300The Apple Watch was the most anticipated wearable of the last couple of years. It’s also the most expensive smartwatch going, available in two sizes starting at £300 for the smallest and rising to £13,500 if you want it in gold.The premium iPhone-only smartwatch has similar capabilities to Android Wear watches, with a heart rate sensor and third-party apps, but it’s software is confusing and marks it out as very much a first-generation product.New for the Apple Watch are the “taptic engine”, which taps you on the wrist rather than just vibrating, and “force touch”, which can detect how hard you press on the screen - acting like a right-click for more options.The screen only turns on when you lift your wrist or press a button – it is just black most of the time – and the battery only lasts one day, charged via a magnetic charging cable. Siri works well for voice dictation or barking out commands, while calls can be taken directly on the wrist using the built-in speaker.Verdict:exquisitely made, but expensive and confused at timesApple Watch review: beautiful hardware spoiled by complicated softwarePebble TimeThe Pebble Time smartwatch is simple, effective and long-lasting.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianPrice:£130The Pebble Time is the newest kid on the block and concentrates on doing a few things right, rather than many poorly.Notifications and showing the time are its primary features, connecting to either an iPhone or Android phone via Bluetooth making it the only watch here that works with both platforms. A microphone enables voice dictation and access to Google searches on Android.The Pebble Time has the longest battery life of any smartwatch currently available lasting between five and seven days per charge using a magnetic charging cable.It uses an e-paper screen, which like a Kindle’s screen is constantly on and can be read easily in direct sunlight. The screen isn’t touch-sensitive, instead the Time has four buttons for navigating the user interface.The Time is thin and light, waterproof to 30m, comes in three colours with a stainless steel bezel and takes regular watch straps.Verdict:the Casio of smartwatches - simple, unfussy and easy to live withPebble Time review: the simple but effective answer to Apple WatchPebble Time review: better on Android than iPhoneMotorola Moto 360The Moto 360 has a large screen that takes up the whole face of the watch.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianPrice:£170The Moto 360 is arguably the best-looking Android Wear smartwatch. Its 1.6in round LCD screen is encased in stainless steel, but has virtually no bezel making it look less chunky than others.It switches on a low-power black and white screen when moved, then lights up fully when lifted to read the time, rather than staying on constantly. It comes in gold, steel and black with a choice of metal and leather straps, and has a good collection of watch faces pre-loaded with more available to download.The 360 has a heart rate monitor on the back, but no GPS for tracking runs, relying on a connected phone instead.A microphone allows voice control and dictation through Google Now, but not calls. Like all other Android Wear watches it connects locally to a smartphone via Bluetooth for access to the internet and to receive notifications. It will also connect to an Android smartphone remotely over Wi-Fi when updated to the latest software version.The battery lasts only one day with general use and is charged using a wireless charging dock in around an hour, which acts as a handy bed-side clock.Verdict:the most attractive smartwatch is let down by weak battery lifeMotorola Moto 360 review: beautiful smartwatch spoiled by poor battery lifeOther reviews•Six of the best noise-cancelling headphones to silence the commute•Android Wear 5.1 review: simple, useful and the best – for now•Asus ZenWatch review: a sophisticated-looking Android smartwatch•Samsung Gear S review: can a smartwatch with a phone built-in replace a smartphone?
How can “sharing economy” enterprises, like taxi-finding scheme Uber, be “a throwback to … when villages used to share” based on personal trust, yet also generate Luddite protests of a similar pre-industrial mindset (Uber bears brunt of sharing economy backlash, 27 June)? Perhaps it’s because Uber et al are not unleashing “new sources of economic activity” at all. Isn’t it simply another corporate finance initiative (with a pre-flotation estimate of $17bn) to transfer income streams away from regulated trades and occupations to big business on the basis of more precarious, casual work?Bryn JonesUniversity of Bath
Users are being urged to update to the latest version of Flash after a security flaw fixed less than a week ago was discovered being exploited in the wild.The bug, which affects how Flash Player plays video files, lets an attacker use a carefully made video file to seize control of a user’s computer. It wasmade public last week by security research firm Fireeye, who discovered the flaw and reported it to Adobe.The publisher has now made a patch available, which can be downloaded using the auto-updater included with Flash.By the time the vulnerability was publicly reported, it was already being used by a Chinese hacking group known as “APT3 [Advanced Persistent Threat 3]”. The group was sending phishing emails aimed at organisations in the aerospace, defence, construction, engineering, high tech, telecommunications and transportation industries, according to Fireeye, which ultimately caused a backdoor to be placed on the victim’s computers.“This group is one of the more sophisticated threat groups that FireEye Threat Intelligence tracks, and they have a history of introducing new browser-based zero-day exploits (eg Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Adobe Flash Player),” the researchers write. A zero-day exploit is one which has never been used before; thus, the firm involved has “zero days” to fix it.Whereas before, the exploit had only been used by APT3, on Saturday, a further warning was put out after it made its way intoa popular exploit kit called Magnitude. Kits such as Magnitude let would-be malware authors put together their software without having to write the exploits, and this has already been used to try and install ransomware on victim’s computers.Installing the latest version of Adobe Flash will leave the system secure once again.
The world is watching with bated breath as the Greek people consider how to vote in the country’s upcoming referendum. A yes vote on Sunday will see Greece accept the terms of the troika’s bailout, and commit itself to further austerity; a no vote will see the country taking the first step towards exiting the Euro entirely.But not everyone is afraid of the prospect of “Grexit”. For proponents of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency, a shaky Mediterranean economy implementing capital controls amid the prospect of full-blown exit from the euro recalls halcyon days gone by.In theory, when the conventional financial system is experiencing turbulence, alternative currencies such as bitcoin should have their time to shine. The decentralised nature of the currency means that it’s impossible for any central bank to impose controls on it, while the pseudonymity at its core could make it the perfect vehicle to get money into and out of the country while avoiding legal reprisals.As a result, Tony Gallippi,the co-founder of bitcoin payment processor Bitpay,tweeted on Sunday nightthat he expected the price of bitcoin to rise to between $610 and $1,250 if Greece exits the Euro. The currency is currently worth $250. On Reddit’s bitcoin subforum,users are sharing tips on how to buy bitcoin in the country, andcommenting on reports of bank runs in the capital: “Should’ve bought bitcoins”.Part of the reason why the crisis is so tempting for proponents of the cryptocurrency is the echoes of a previous crisis in the Eurozone: the banking collapse in Cyprus in 2013, which saw that nation also impose capital controls to prevent massive outflows of currency from the panicking country.That collapse came at the same time as the first major boom in the price of bitcoin, which began the year at less than $20 and peaked at ten times that by early April – before it all came crashing down.At the time, many credited the price rise to interest in the currency sparked by the banking crisis, but Nathaniel Popper, author of the bookDigital Gold: the Untold Story of Bitcoin, says that they are labouring under a misapprehension.Speaking on the Guardian’s Tech Weekly podcast, Popper explained that the rise was more likely caused by an influx of money from Silicon Valley. In those days, “if someone buys $1m of bitcoin in one go … that will make the price rise”, he said.For now, the price of bitcoin has steadily risen as the Greek crisis has intensified, from $240 on Wednesday to $250 over the weekend. It remains a long way off its 2014 highs of $1,000 per coin, but what happens after Sunday’s vote is anybody’s guess.
Elaine suffers from depression and anxiety. A psychiatric nurse suggested that she learn how to use a computer to keep in contact with her family so that she didn’t feel so isolated. So Elaine decided to attend one-to-one tutorials at Cambridge Online. “I’m in my 50s. We didn’t have computers when I was at school, so it was quite a job to teach me. I didn’t even know how to use a keyboard and was afraid if I hit a wrong button, I would break it.”Since then she has learned how to type, use a search engine, send emails, save photos and make birthday cards by following the Tinder Foundation’s Learn My Way courses. “My family lives in Scotland, but because of the computer I was able to see my nephew’s fourth birthday pictures the next day. It’s opened up a whole new life for me. If I go online I can lose myself for quite a while and it stops my mind wandering and thinking about myself.”For 20 years, Cambridge Online has offered free courses to disabled and disadvantaged adults. Every year 300 new learners are referred to their centre where they deliver 4,000 one-to-one tutorials annually. “Most of the people who come here have never touched a computer before. Confidence that the whole thing’s not going to blow up when they touch it is what people struggle with in the beginning,” says Andrew Entecott.There are 10 computers at the centre with adaptive hardware, touch screens, alternative keyboards and mice, and magnification and screen-reading software. “We try to sell the benefits of going online by explaining that learning how to use a mouse and keyboard can reduce the amount of time you spend on the phone speaking to the council.”The ONS found that 27% of disabled adults had never used the internet, compared to 11% of non-disabled adultsHowever using a computer is still something many disabled people struggle with. According to the Office for National Statistics, in May 2015, 27% of disabled adults had never used the internet, compared to 11% of non-disabled adults. In 2013, Ofcom said that factors beyond age and income, possibly related to the individual’s disability, contribute to limited internet access.The Extra Costs Commission, launched by the disability charity Scope, did a year-long enquiry exploring the extra costs faced by disabled people, estimated to be on average £550 more a month. In the report released in June 2015 they cite that disabled people could save money by learning how to use the internet, for example by using cost comparison websites, yet disabled people were not online because of a lack of training, cost of equipment and the accessibility of web content.Web accessibility is something that Ian Macrae struggles with every day. As someone with a visual impairment he uses VoiceOver software. He doesn’t often recommend people simulate a visual impairment, but recommends that if you have a Mac, to turn on VoiceOver using the Command+F5 keys. “Don’t cheat and look, but try navigating a website. I use Amazon every day to find Kindle Daily Deals. To do that I have to go through every heading before I reach what I want, then I have to go through each element within that heading to get to the list of books. The whole process of navigating a website is a long and complicated process,” he says.However Macrae still recommends that people with a visual impairment learn how to use the internet, saying that it can be a “liberating experience”, giving the example of doing a weekly shop online instead of the hassle of walking around a shop. He would also advise web designers to create websites that are accessible for everyone, for instance by labeling all buttons and refraining from using too much multimedia, such as Flash. “I’m not saying people shouldn’t use Flash, but they shouldn’t make their website reliant on it because if it is, the website is completely inaccessible to a [visually impaired] person.”Some disabled adults will never see the benefits of being online. Jack lives in sheltered accommodation at Steve Woolley Court in Peterborough. He suffers from Parkinson’s disease and has no interest in the internet. “I thought it would be easy when I first heard about it, but I just get confused. I’m just so fed up with it all. Get yourself a television if you’re lonely,” he says. “If I was told the information I needed about my pension was online, I don’t know what I’d do. I’d have to get my scheme manager to do it for me.”Related:Online dating is hard enough. Try doing it with a disability | Timothy SykesHis scheme manager, Sean Siggee, disagrees with Jack when he says he’s not interested. “Jack is interested in the internet. He’s trying to get into it, but he just needs guidance.” Of the 34 residents living at the sheltered accommodation, 20 use a computer. “Jack doesn’t like to ask for help. He feels like he’s a burden and doesn’t want to bother me. It’s the same with everyone. They’re afraid to keep asking, but they need to because everything is going online.”The Extra Costs Commission suggest that web accessibility for disabled people isn’t an area theGovernment’s Digital Inclusion Strategyhas addressed directly, nor does it offer clear accountability for improving digital accessibility. They’re calling for a review of the impact of the Equality Act in improving web accessibility and taking action when service providers fail to meet their obligations.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “We’ve put accessibility at the heart of our award-winninggov.ukwebsite, which is compatible with a variety of accessibility tools. But we recognise that not everyone is online. That’s why we’ll always provide assisted digital support for people accessing government services. We’re also working with the private and voluntary sectors to ensure that everyone in the UK has the basic digital skills needed to benefit from being online.”One of these partners isGo On UK. The charity was set-up in 2012 by Baroness Martha Lane Fox. Their goal is to help people realise the benefits of being online. Its Chief Executive Rachel Neaman said: “It is the combined responsibility of government, the public, private and not-for-profit sectors to help close the digital divide. 10.5 million adults, 1.2m small businesses, and over half of all charities in the UK lack the basic digital skills they need to succeed in today’s digital society.”Neaman says this represents “tens of billions of pounds in losses to the economy; billions more in efficiency savings for government and businesses; and the loss of countless benefits for individuals”.
The new music streaming service from Apple – yep, it’s called Apple Music – goes live on Tuesday. Here’s everything you need to know.What is Apple Music?Quite similar to Spotify. It will offer access to tens of millions of songs on demand over the internet on iOS devices - iPhones, iPads, Macs and PCs initially, with Apple TV and Android devices following this year.Can I get it for free like Spotify?No. There is a three-month free trial, after which you’ll have to stump up £9.99 a month in the UK or $9.99 in the US (Australian prices yet to be announced). That’s the same as Spotify - but you will be able to listen to Taylor Swift. After pulling her music from Spotify last year, she is letting Apple stream her songs. It’s also the only place to hear Pharrell Williams’ new song, Freedom - artist exclusives will be a key part of Apple’s strategy.Pharrell Williams performs at Glastonbury.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesApple is offering a rather attractive “family plan” for up to six accounts for £15/$15 a month. Spotify has something similar, but each additional user costs £4.99 a month for up to four extra users.What else is different?Well, there’s Beats 1, a global radio station broadcast from studios in London, New York and Los Angeles. It will feature presenters including Zane Lowe and shows from the likes of Drake, Elton John, St Vincent, Disclosure and Dr Dre - who co-founded the Beats headphones business with Jimmy Iovine before the pair sold it to Apple last year. Cheapskates will be pleased to know that Beats 1 will be available without an Apple Music subscription.Annie Clark - aka St Vincent - at the Roundhouse in London in October 2014.Photograph: Nick Pickles/WireImageGive me some gimmicks...Siri is on board, which means iOS users can tell her to “add the new Florence and the Machine album to my library”.Florence Welch gets close to the Glastonbury crowd.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesAnd if you’re the lucky owner of an Apple Watch you can sync music to it and play it – even if your paired iPhone is not nearby. I hope that’s clear.Even more music …Just in case you weren’t aware of the existence of social media, Apple Music will let artists share comments, pictures, videos and the like – and respond directly to users’ thoughts. Why? “When musicians are free to express themselves directly to their fans, it’s a powerful thing,” says Apple sagely.Apple Music also promises to help users discover more music they like – by offering “suggestions from our experts who know and love music”. Just how good its algorithms are remains to be seen.There will also be playlists on offer from Apple Music editors, as well as writers for Rolling Stone, Q, Pitchfork, Mojo, DJ magazine and Shazam.Will it be better than Spotify?Good question. As a happy Spotify subscriber you’re likely to have dozens of playlists on the app and like the way it works, so may be inclined to stick with it for a while yet. But for the millions who have never used a streaming service, Apple Music is likely to prove very popular indeed.Will Apple Music be a hit?Yes. For the price of two (central London) pints, the ability to listen to any song or album anywhere you have an internet connection is a no brainer. Once they have it, most music fans will never be able to give it up. Millions are used to paying for Sky or Netflix to watch telly – and if anyone can make the subscription model work for music, it is Apple.
If you’ve been a gamer for at least 10 years, the chances are, your under-stairs cupboard is a shantytown of plastic guitars, dusty half-size drum kits and unsolvable tangles of wire.Once upon a time, Guitar Hero and its many copycats ruled gaming, playing to arena-sized crowds of excited fans – but then they exited the business with unusual haste. The genre, in which players strap on plastic guitars and strum along in time with an eclectic soundtrack, was so dominant it even lured in The Beatles, that notoriously vigilant guarder of legacy. But it came at a cost. Viacom spent $20m (£12.7m) on advertising alone for The Beatles: Rock Band, a figure that illustrates both the belief in the genre at the time, and the depth of its subsequent fall. By 2010, wearied players had hung up their instruments en mass, and the flood of music games slowed to a drip.Six years on and Guitar Hero, the game that took the genre mainstream, is set for a comeback in the form of Guitar Hero Live, designed by British developer FreeStyle Games (creator of the superb DJ Hero series). The theory is unchanged: notes move towards you down a stave and, when they pass an on-screen marker, you must hold down the corresponding button on your toy guitar (which now has a six-button configuration: three buttons toward the top of the guitar neck, and three toward the bottom, in parallel) and strum. Correctly match the timing and the guitar note will play out. Miss and there’ll be an awkward splang in the soundtrack. You’re scored on your timing, and, unbroken strings of correct notes will earn you multipliers that contribute to a high score.But while the action remains untouched, the aesthetic has been overhauled. Gone are the gangly 3D characters that posed and grimaced on stage behind the musical stave in the late 2000s. They’ve been replaced by filmed footage of adoring crowds and other band members, with whom you pretend to perform as you play through the soundtrack. There are no virtual characters or stages to be seen anywhere in the game.Related:Guitar Hero Live – music game returns with new guitar and fresh lookPerhaps the most interesting element of nouveau Guitar Hero is not the switch from 3D models to filmed actors, but rather Guitar Hero TV, an always-on music television-style channel that enables you to play along via a slew of music videos, both vintage and contemporary. The results are visually closer to SingStar, Sony’s elegant karaoke series, with clean lines and an uncluttered heads-up display (HUD). Put the guitar down at any point, and the screen will clear, so you can watch the music video uninterrupted. Play along and you can alter the song’s difficulty on the fly. In contrast to earlier titles in the series, the game won’t kick you out if you miss to many notes.The channels (of which there will be two at launch, themed around different musical styles) run to a programming schedule, just like MTV of yesteryear – although, if you have a particular song you’re into, you can play it immediately by spending a ‘play’ token, which are earned through playing the game. You can change channels at any time mid-song (there is an all new GHTV button on the new guitar peripheral itself) and at launch there will hundreds of tracks, all available for free, ready to look at and play whenever you want. If you want to own a particular song forever and not use play tokens, you can buy it for a small real money fee, or you can buy a “party pass” which unlocks every song in the game for an evening – ideal for when you have friends over and want to play together.As well as classic and contemporary music videos, GHTV will offer so-called premium shows, based on live recordings (in the demo, Activision showed off a live DVD, which could be watched and played along with, by the Black Veil Brides). These shows can be purchased for play or you can complete challenges to earn the right to play. The game might require you to score three stars or more on a trio of tracks in order to unlock the premium show – although, if you go the challenge route, you’ll have to attempt three new challenges to play if for a second time, and so on. The premium shows offer premium rewards, such as themed fretboards – theres a steampunk version, decorated with spinning cogs and whizzing sound effects – or an upturned skateboard deck.Activision plans to add swathes of new songs to GHTV during the year, a generous model that seeks to solve one of the issues that arguably led to the genre’s downfall: the need for players to constantly add buy new add-on packs in order to expand their song library. It’s also an inventive way to bring the art of the music visual back into the living room – a video game to save the radio star.
The arrival of a Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition on Playstation 4 and Xbox One is welcome, though somewhat perplexing.Sure, Capcom’s slick hack-n-slasher was favourably received when it first arrived on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2008. This is a much-loved franchise, characterised by its frenetic, stylised gameplay, which is both satisfying to play and exciting to watch – not least because lead protagonist Dante remains one of gaming’s most suave and compelling characters. This enhanced edition of the fourth title in the series keeps the excellent combo-based and enthrallingly deep gameplay intact whilst updating the visuals to make it truly the best version of any of the original games.On the other hand, however, the franchise has already been successfully rebooted for modern playersvia Ninja Theory’s 2013 brawlerDmC: Devil May Cry,which itself has been re-released with a Definitive Edition earlier this year on current-gen platforms. Compared to that sharp, highly focused thrill ride, Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition can seem a little bloated and overwhelming.The story follows the exploits of Nero, a knight who serves in the mysterious Order of the Sword whose leader is murdered by the protagonist of the previous three games, Dante. To further complicate matters the Order of the Sword worship Sparda, Dante’s father. Nero is forced to question his beliefs as the game progresses, with a series of events that see you take control of Dante part way through the adventure.It’s at this point that the flaws become apparent. In a game that is built around the concept of repetition in order to test player skill and allow the attainment of higher combo scores, variation in environments and enemy types are crucial components to avoid stagnation. But as Dante, you’re forced to retrace the steps of Nero and visit previously explored locations with a character that only has a slight variation in combat mechanics. Add to this a frankly rather dull puzzle section towards the end of the game and you’re left with an experience that looked slightly dated seven years ago and now seems positively prehistoric.Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition does, however, provide a fair amount of content that makes revisiting the game worthwhile for fans of the series or for those who enjoy a good, masochistic challenge. The ultra-hard Legendary Dark Knight mode is, for example, seemingly designed only for those who felt that the likes of Dark Souls 2 and Boodborne were going easy on them.Yet surprisingly the biggest draw here is the inclusion of three new characters: Trish, Lady and Virgil. Where Nero and Dante feel somewhat similar to play, the three newcomers are refreshingly differentiated. These aren’t mere reskins – they represent very different ways to play the game and are perhaps the single best reason to purchase this edition. The fluid freedom of motion that embodies Trish’s style juxtaposes perfectly with the slower but powerful moves of Lady , while Virgil’s more calculated yet vicious attacks sit somewhere between the two. The ability to readjust the moveset of each character at any given time, a feature introduced in DmC: Devil May Cry,is also very welcome addition.For the uninitiated, the inclusion of these characters probably won’t have enormous significance. There is little reference to the fact that Virgil is Dante’s brother and that the third game revolved entirely around their conflict. While some effort has been made to incorporate the three new ensemble additions into the plot, their presence often feels shoehorned in and it can be quite jarring at times.Typically, remasters of this sort are great for those coming fresh to a series but don’t tend to offer enough for fans who have already seen them through to conclusion. Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition is the opposite, providing very credible reasons to play through two, three or even four times for those who have real affection for the franchise.In many ways, the excellent reboot offers the better initiation into the business of hyper-stylised demon slaying. However, this special edition costs just twenty pounds and offers the sort of traditional brawler mechanics we just don’t see anymore. Indeed, players able to look past the flaws will find one of the most pure, visceral action games available on current machines.Capcom; PS4 (version tested)/Xbox One/PC via Steam; £19.99; Pegi rating: 16+
It’s Monday everyone!
It takes a bold developer to tackle long-distance cycling as a subject matter. Arduous uphill climbs and hours in the peloton simply aren’t obvious elements for enthralling gameplay. But despite the challenges, Cyanide has crafted a surprisingly captivating game withTour de France 2015, by offering a winning blend of strategy and racing.Asking the player to take teams through the titular contest’s stages, the experience swings between flashes of intensity akin to those in the most sincere and realistic motor racing titles and peculiarly meditative, protracted stretches of drifting through rural France.The cycling itself is action-oriented and accessible, where a focus on energy management over hogging first place offers a really distinct racing experience. Strategy and depth, meanwhile, are introduced through an intuitive system for commanding team-mates and hopping between riders.Unlikely to convert non-cyclists,Tour de France 2015is admittedly unadventurous in presentation and staid in character, but it proves understated gameplay need not come at the expense of immersion.
An anarchic injection of bonus content makes this team-based shooter a fun social experience for the, well, shall we say, morally flexible. As the masked Payday Gang, a group of violent crooks for hire, you blow chunks out of Washington DC for fun and profit. Most missions are riffs on “fend off the cops while getting away with filthy lucre”. This Xbox One and PS4 port gives you more – more guns, more missions, more crooks – including DLC crossovers withHotline MiamiandJohn Wick, while the ability to plan raids with a team makes a huge difference.You can dabble in different play styles, going in sneaky or guns blazing, but unfortunately some cracks haven’t really been papered over – certain parts still look last-gen, connections can be finicky and the bot AI is barely there. However, when it all comes together, with a full team that works well, there are many blasts to be had (and made).
In the hands of developer Natsume, the labyrinthine history ofHarvest Moontakes a fresh turn. After 2013’sA New Beginningreboot,Harvest Moon: The Lost Valleydevelops things beyond a simple farm simulation to the rather grander story of placating the Harvest Goddess and restoring peace to the village.Nonetheless, planting, watering and tending crops, along with caring for animals, are still central; they result in goods to trade with townsfolk, which in turn develops relationships and uncovers specific tasks. Do well at these and a life partner can be won, as well as the prospect of having children. There’s also a nod to theMinecraftset, withThe Lost Valleygranting terrain sculpting for the first time. Shovel and hoe, flatten or raise farmland to create custom landscapes and more space to grow.However, these innovations rarely cohere into a whole. The lack of a central village loses the freeform feel of past games. Features that have been aimed at younger players are often too unwieldy to be effective and new abilities feel more like a chore than a joy. While there’s great ambition, the simple charms ofHarvest Moonhave been lost in its complexity.
Google’s self-driving cars are having a rough time on the streets of Mountain View, California. But a look at the evidence suggests it’s human error and not robots that are to blame.In recent months, Google’s fleet of experimental self-driving cars have suffered five minor accidents while driving 200,000 miles around this sleepy Silicon Valley suburb. That is nearly ten times the national average for ‘property only’ fender benders, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Using a public records act request, the Guardian has obtained a report of the most recent incident, filed by Google in early June with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. In the report, Google notes that a self-driving Lexus was struck from behind 17 seconds after stopping at a traffic light. The other vehicle, a Honda Accord, simply drove into the back of it.Since April, Google’s Lexus SUVs have also been rear-ended by a BMW S3, a Toyota Camry and a Ford Expedition. In each case, the Google vehicle was either stationary or travelling at less than five miles per hour, giving its robotic driver no chance to avoid an impact. In fact, when robot cars meet in unfavourable circumstances, it seemsthey don’t collide.Last week it was reported that a self-driving Audi owned by Delphi Automotive took “appropriate action” to avoid one of Google’s self-driving Lexus cars after the Google car cut the Audi off on a Californian road.But if Google’s self-driving algorithms are not to blame, why are its cars experiencing so many accidents?One explanation could be the spinning laser scanners on their roofs, says Raj Rajkumar, designer of several autonomous cars at Carnegie Mellon University, including the winner of a 2007 self-driving vehicle competition run by Darpa, a US military research agency. “It is a distraction, and when people get distracted, I can imagine behaviours changing,” he says.“Another reason could be that Google cars have the Google logo splashed on them, saying they are self-driving cars. People looking at that could be distracted from their normal mode of operations,” he adds. Rajkumar is now CEO of Ottomatika, a company that helped develop technology for the first vehicle to complete a transcontinental self-driving road trip, from San Francisco to New York, in March. He noticed that passing drivers would often whip out a phone to take photos or videos of his car.Of course, the promise of self-driving cars is that they will reduce – or even eliminate – road traffic fatalities. “About 33,000 people die on America’s roads every year. That’s why so much of the enthusiasm for self-driving cars has focused on their potential to reduce accident rates,” says Chris Urmson, director of Google’s self-driving car program. He also points out that minor fender-benders like the ones in Mountain View often go unreported.The few dozen experimental self-driving cars currently operating on public streets are packed with laser, radar, sonar and video sensors. This gives them a 360-degree view of the road ahead (and behind) that a human driver could never match. After travelling over 1.8 million miles in California, they have managed to avoid any serious accidents – and may have even prevented some from happening.However, there has been virtually no research on how human motorists respond to robotic vehicles, says Anuj Pradhan, a behavioural scientist at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI). “We do not fully understand the human reaction where self-driving cars are involved,” he says. “It’s an important question that we haven’t started looking at yet.”Two of his colleagues at UMTRI, Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle, believe that driving is far more of a human interaction than you might expect. They found that in several types of car crashes, male-to-male accidents are underrepresented and female-to-female crashes are overrepresented, suggesting that our perceptions of fellow motorists are critical. “Furthermore, in many situations, drivers make eye contact and proceed according to the feedback received from other drivers,” they say. “Such feedback would be absent in interactions with self-driving vehicles.”When self-driving cars do become available to buy, they will be sharing the road with humans for decades to come. “Self-driving cars may have a ‘better’ driving style but it may not be a human driving style,” says Pradhan, “And that could affect how we predict or react to them.” He says that many self-driving car companies are now actively trying to humanise their algorithms to match the way people drive, slowing right down for curves, for instance, or hesitating at traffic lights.One phenomenon that may help to reduce accidents in the short term: the distinctive and potentially distracting lidar sensors on top of vehicles are disappearing. In Google’s latest generation of self-driving cars, which received their permits to operate on California’s roads last week, the laser scanner has shrunk to a barely noticeable dome. Many other autonomous vehicles, including a Cadillac SRX built by Raj Rajkumar, hide them altogether. “We specifically made sure there was nothing on the car that makes it stand out,” he says.Anuj Pradhan thinks a better approach might be to identify autonomous vehicles so that motorists can give them leeway. “Should self-driving cars have a special marking so we can react accordingly?” he wonders. “If I see a learner driver, I give it a little more following distance. Perhaps that’s how regular drivers would react to a self-driving car.”Ultimately, say Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoette, we should be realistic about just how safe self-driving cars will make our highways. “It is not a foregone conclusion that a self-driving vehicle would ever perform more safely than an experienced, middle-aged driver,” they say. “And during the transition period when conventional and self-driving vehicles share the road, safety might actually worsen, at least for conventional vehicles.”Google’s rash of rear-ends might just be a coincidence, then, but we shouldn’t expect people to stop driving into robots anytime soon.
Nobody wants to confront the idea of their own obsolescence. Still, sitting across a desk from Kris Hammond, in his office overlooking the lake shore in Chicago, it is hard not to at least have a sense of the inevitable.Hammond is the co-founder and chief scientistof a company calledNarrative Science, which, among other things, has worked out a way of teaching machines how to write journalism. At the moment, the computers’ output is limited to basic sports reports and business news. But Hammond is convinced this is only the beginning. It probably won’t be that long, he half-suggests, before they can bash out 2,500 word stories on innovations in machine learning for theObserver New Review. Worse, he is irrepressibly cheerful about the prospect.“Look!” he says, “we are humanising the machine and giving it the ability not only to look at data but, based on general ideas of what is important and a close understanding of who the audience is, we are giving it the tools to know how to tell us stories.”Terrific, I think.Narrative Science is one of a number of companies that have married huge advances in pattern recognition software with the revolution in natural language generation to create algorithms that resemble a writer (minus the soul-searching and the procrastination and the deadline anxiety). They are at the stage where the machine can, given the statistics of a baseball game, do this, for example:Related:Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak says humans will be robots' pets“Tuesday was a great day for W Roberts, as the junior pitcher threw a perfect game to carry Virginia to a 2-0 victory over George Washington at Davenport Field.“Twenty-seven Colonials came to the plate and the Virginia pitcher vanquished them all, pitching a perfect game. He struck out 10 batters while recording his momentous feat.“Tom Gately came up short on the rubber for the Colonials, recording a loss. He went three innings, walked two, struck out one and allowed two runs. The Cavaliers went up for good in the fourth, scoring two runs on a fielder’s choice and a balk.”Or, without any “journalistic” intervention, this (by one of Narrative Science’s competitors,Automated Insights) for the newswire AP:“Apple Inc (AAPL) on Tuesday reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $18.02bn.“The Cupertino, California-based company said it had profit of $3.06 per share.“The results surpassed Wall Street expectations. The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products posted revenue of $74.6bn in the period, also exceeding Street forecasts. Analysts expected $67.38bn…”It’s not deathless prose – at least not yet; the machines are still “learning” day by day how to write effectively – but it’s already good enough to replace the jobs once done by wire reporters. Narrative Science’s computers provide daily market reports forForbesas well sports reports for the Big Ten sports network. Automated Insights does all the data-based stock reports for AP.Have readers noticed? Last year, a Swedish media professor,Christer Clerwall, conducted the first proper blind study into how sports reports written by computers and by humans compared. Readers taking part in the study suggested, on the whole, that the reports written by human sports journalists were slightly more accessible and enjoyable, but that those written by computer seemed a little more informative and trustworthy.“Perhaps the most interesting result in the study is that there are [almost] no… significant differences in how the two texts are perceived,” Clerwall concluded. “An optimistic view would be that automated content will… allow reporters to focus on more qualified assignments, leaving the descriptive ‘recaps’ to the software.”Kris Hammond at Narrative Science shares that optimism (although he also suggests, with an edge of mischief, that a computer will win a Pulitzer prize within five years, and that 90% of journalism will be written by computer by 2030). He sees the stories generated by Narrative Science’s programme, Quill, as a way of augmenting and personalising news, of making it relevant to individual needs.Kris Hammond, Larry Birnbaum and Stuart Frankel of Narrative Science.Photograph: Peter Wynn Thompson/NYTSitting in his office, in which about 30 programmers and designers work to perfect Quill’s growing, irrepressible output, I have a copy of theChicago Tribuneon the desk in front of me, a paper produced only a few blocks away in one of those grand, art deco, American newspaper buildings like that of Clark Kent’sDaily Planet. TheTribune’s lead story is about a tornado that the previous day had ripped through towns in northern Illinois.Could Quill have put that together?Given access to social media sites and weather reports, it probably could have told the story, Hammond suggests, though this is not something they are interested in attempting right now. “The tornado is one story. We can do that. But we would rather use the technology to tell this story a million different ways that nails what is important about it to a particular group or even an individual. A natural disaster story might result, instead, in a report sent out to 10,000 companies showing how their supply chain is impacted, or, say, directly to people who the data suggests have relatives out there. That will not come very soon, but that is what news will become.”How close are they to the first inklings of that kind of service?“By the end of this year,” Hammond says, “I think you will be able to say to the machine: I want to tell this kind of story. It’s about, say, the budget numbers of this city department. I want to compare these numbers with other similar city departments and I want to analyse them retrospectively for anomalies, and you will point it in the direction of the data and off it will go. All the analysis and reasoning will be in there. The language will have a human feel to it. A traditional journalist might go to the phones and find a story. We will go to the data.”In this sense, Hammond believes we are at the beginning of a new relationship with the digital world. The great mass of data that is being gathered second by second, collected by our cars, our homes, our search histories, our businesses, our governments, remains for the most part “raw”, unanalysed. In order to get what we need from it we have to build a query or work out how to do analytics. And then we have to know how to look at spreadsheets and dashboards and make some sense of them.Related:Computer says no: Amazon uses AI to combat fake reviews“Imagine as the CEO of a major company you go off and spend £100m on gathering data,” Hammond says. “In theory, you can get an idea of what is going on in every single aspect of your company. But when you have got it, what do you do? You ask a guy who knows about spreadsheets and powerpoints and tell him to make sense of it. It’s like: did you forget you spent all this money? We are that guy. We have built a system that looks at the data, figures out where the story lies in it, pulls that data out, analyses it in the right way and converts it into language the CEO will understand.”Hammond fully intends to live to see the day when people look at spreadsheets and data sets as being as antiquated as computer punch cards.What is the most sophisticated thing the machine can do in this respect now? “We can do an eight-page exegesis of one number,” Hammond says, “for example on how likely it is a company is going to default on its debt. The eight pages will be written in plain English, supported where appropriate by graphs and tables. It will show you how it got to its conclusion. It is fine to read. The most important bits of analysis are shoved to the top.”Can it do that in different tones of voice, as it were? Can it do quirky?“It probably could, but I resist it. We can inject some randomness. But I like to have a trail that says, this is why this is here. We will have quirky and we have had sarcastic. But it has to be the result of a decision; at some point in the system, it has to be as a result, dare I say it, of conscious reasoning. At every point there has to be – here’s why I said this.”Like many human journalists, Quill began life by writing ad-hoc film reviews. About six years ago, working in the artificial intelligence labs at Northwestern University, Hammond and some students built a system calledNews at Seven, with the aim of presenting the results of a standard computer search query as a narrative argument. In this way, for example, it would build a conversational kind of film review, which was structured using conflicting observations from movie data sites –IMDBandRotten Tomatoesand the rest. The conclusions of the review would reflect the consensus of opinion.The News at Seven project also resulted in Hammond’s team collaborating with the augustMedill School of Journalismat Northwestern, which has been training reporters for nearly a century. That was the beginning of Narrative Science, which, with the help of budding sports journalists who created its lexicon of natural baseball language, turned its attention to data-driven sports reporting. A year or so in, they gave a presentation to sports news organisations. A reporter from ESPN was “angry and appalled,” Hammond suggests, “but not because, he said, I am looking at a story and it seems to have been written by a machine, but because I am looking at a story and it appears to have been written by a human being and I have a real sense of this person’s voice.”Quill quickly learned to frame stories to suit its audience. If the readers were the supporters of a particular baseball team, it gave the match report from that team’s vantage. Likewise, if it is creating two company reports based on the same data, the machine can produce a positive emphasis for clients and a must-try-harder tone for employees. It has learned the art of spin.‘Like any decent hack, the machine is coming to learn that there are only five or six compelling tales .’Photograph: iLexx/Getty Images/VettaMuch of that comes from analysis of narrative arcs, of basic plotlines. Like any decent hack, the machine is coming to learn that there are only five or six compelling tales available: back from the brink, outrageous fortune, sudden catastrophe and so on. The machine is not about to write nuanced profiles or wisecracking think pieces. But within its data-rich limits, Hammond and his team are finding many of the same patterns of story. “Performance review – measuring against benchmarks – is 70% of what we do. The big question most people have about anything – sports, business, politics – is: how is it doing?”Thinking about this, imagining measuring my performance as a writer against a machine’s infinite capacity for number crunching, I wonder how much human intuition about where stories lie, about what will move or interest or excite readers, can be replicated. Having done this for 20 years or so, I suggest that as soon as an idea for a story is presented now, I have a pretty clear idea of how it will go, where it will likely begin and end. Can such things be taught to a computer?“In the longer run, I believe that machines will be as smart and eventually smarter than we are about everything,” Hammond says.But will it ever be able to replicate great storytelling that, like a piece of music, takes us on an emotional journey? Or through an argument that unfolds in surprising ways?Related:You won’t believe what the smarter robot is reading these days…“When I think about that I always remember an interview I once heard with Bob Dylan,” Hammond says. “He didn’t know a lot about a lot of things, but he knew better than almost anybody how to craft a song so that it would produce particular effects. When a great writer tells a story, he or she knows how to craft it to make readers believe something, through argument, a set of emotional dramas or a particular structure. You can make someone sad without being sad yourself. Or you can make someone angry and be completely calm and distanced from that anger. That is what journalism does. It is a craft. It is not that the machine will have its own emotional states but it will know that it is doing enough to produce that reaction. At the moment, we can probably make someone happy or sad about how something has turned out at a very coarse-grained level; that will become more subtle.”Does he imagine that there will be a resistance to the idea that the interaction between writer and reader has been deconstructed and manipulated in that way?“I don’t think it will take anything away from that interaction,” he says. “Storytelling is one of the great gifts we have. When you go home, what is the question your wife or husband asks? ‘How did your day go?’ That’s not going to stop. But what the machine will be able to do is to communicate with us about a lot of the other stuff that goes on in the world and explain how it relates to us. What would you rather have? A device that has control and access to an enormous amount of information, which you have to struggle to get to? Or would you rather the machine just told you in clear language what you wanted to know?”That sounds like a question that is loaded in favour of the future, though it is already beginning to describe the present. It also instinctively fails the first test of journalism: it sounds way too good to be true.
There has never been a better time to buy a small car. The current crop of compact, ingenious, well-designed and super-economic vehicles are the best there has ever been. Manufacturers know that emerging electric and hybrid technology will dramatically change the cars we drive in the future, but this Class of 2015 proves that, until then, the dinky car can be frisky, frugal and a lot of fun to drive.Mazda 2: £11,995; MPG 60.1; Top speed 106mphLoaded with gadgets, gizmos and driver aids, the Mazda 2 has the swagger of a motor that means business. Keyless entry, cruise control, media connectivity and brilliant performance… Someone at Mazda HQ has clearly got their sums horribly wrong as it seems too cheap. More and more drivers are downsizing to more usable cars and the Mazda 2 proves that driving small doesn’t mean you have to think small.Ford Fiesta: £10,145; MPG 65.7; Top speed 112mphFord Fiesta: Britain’s best-selling car.Britain’s bestselling car will be 40 next year and you don’t need to spend long in its company to realise why it’s stayed at the top for so long. It’s neat and well equipped, and its handling is as sharp as it looks. The only drawbacks are the fiddly stereo and a fairly duff dashboard.Suzuki Swift: £8,999; MPG 44.1; Top speed 121mphSuzuki: Swift by name, swift by nature.Few cars in this class are as fun to drive. It’s not as refined as some others and its economy could be better, but its handling is go-kart brilliant. The boot is poky and too long in the backseat will soon have you in a neck brace. Up front the nominated driver will be having a blast.Peugeot 208: £11,695; MPG 62.8; Top speed 109mphPeugeot 208: the lion roars again!It’s 25 years since Peugeot ruled the roost with its 205. It was fun, fast and sexy. Now, after a quarter of a century, Peugeot has finally refound that French flair. The 208 is its bestselling car. It feels poised, pimped and posh. It’s loaded with gadgets and is clearly aimed at today’s ‘yoots’!Hyundai i20: £10,695; MPG 65.7; Top speed 99mphHyundai i20: all-round reliable performer.This new model from South Korea won’t set your pulse racing – and falling just short of the 100mph mark seems a bit sad – but the i20 exudes can-do ability. It copes with anything you throw at it – from rat runs to motorways – and comes with a confidence-boosting five-year warranty.Fiat Panda: £9,275; MPG 67.3; Top speed 110mphFiat Panda: short and upright but amazingly roomy.A mainstay of entry-level holiday rentals, the Panda is often seen as no more than a car for fun in the sun. But why? Its unorthodox shape makes it incredibly roomy and its funky interior is robust, well-conceived and easy to live with. It’s also a very comfortable drive.Honda Jazz: £11,695; MPG 50.5; Top speed 113mphJazz hands: the Honda has many firm friends, but deserves more.Jeremy Clarkson bought one for his mother – and we know bully boys love their mums. The Jazz is adored by OAPs, but deserves a much younger audience. It is individual, ingenious and packed with clever little details. Just don’t get one in pale purple – it looks like a blue rinse.Email Martin atmartin.love@observer.co.ukor follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166
For the past five years, one company has dominated the handheld games market. Sure, its major competitor fights a good fight, but there’s no doubting who’s boss.I’m not talking about Sony and Nintendo, by the way. No: the real fight is between Apple and Google.Gaming revenue on Apple’s app store in the fourth quarter of 2014 was twice that of the entire market of dedicated handheld consoles (which is dominated by Nintendo’s 3DS console). Two-thirds of the top hundred grossing apps on the app store, and nine of the top 10, are games. Apple has opened up gaming to a whole new audience, and is in charge of the biggest video-game platform the world has ever seen.So why is it so embarrassed by games?The company’s sneering attitude to the field it dominates was expressed again on Thursday, whenit removed a group of war games from the App Storefor what it described as “offensive or mean-spirited” use of the Confederate flag. The games, which are largely dry military re-enactments, use the Confederate flag to represent the southern armies, and the Stars and Stripes to represent the northern.Some have arguedthat the removal was “an understandable, if clunky, reaction to a symbol that has specific connotations”,othersthat it’s “an ultra-rare case of political correctness actually genuinely gone mad”.But regardless of whether Apple, which did not respond to a request for comment for this article, was oversensitive or not, what stands out is how games, uniquely, were censored. The company still sells all seven seasons of Dukes of Hazzard, with its confederate flag-decked General Lee. It also sells the albums Give Out But Don’t Give Up by Primal Scream and Legend by Lynyrd Skynyrd, both of which prominently display the flag as part of their cover art. If the flag should go, it should surely go everywhere.Apple, however, disagrees. To the company’s credit, it’s uncharacteristically verbose about its feelings:the review guidelines for its app store open with the admissionthat “we view Apps different than books or songs”.“If you want to criticise a religion, write a book,” the company instructs would-be developers. “If you want to describe sex, write a book or a song, or create a medical App.”Of course, when there’s money to be made, Apple is happy to pretend that it agrees with the bulk of gamers who view the medium as a flourishing artform, capable of greatness equal to – if necessarily different from – books or music. In May, the company ran a promotion on the app store highlighting visually stunning games with the tagline “games are art. Here is the proof”.Thankfully, none of those games decided to be art in the wayRonald Maxwell’s Gettysburgis, or they would have been removed as part of the sweep of the app store as well.The problem with Apple’s attitude to games isn’t just that it treats them differently to books and music, though. After all, there are undeniable differences between them: no book can hack your device, no song can download pirated content, and no movie can abuse in-app payments.All of those factors necessitate some sort of review process above and beyond what legacy media needs. And once that hurdle is introduced, maybe Apple could even argue for a stricter control on content. After all, it’s their store, and they can sell what they want (although that logic falls down somewhatwhen that store controls access to a significant proportion of the market single-handedly).But even within games, the company has made clear that it holds the market with a fair degree of contempt.This week, it removed “Kill the plumber” from the app store, for including “content or features that resemble a well-known third-party material, Super Mario Bros”. The game, which lets you play as a series of monsters attempting to kill a, yes, blue-and-red garbed plumber, is a deliberate parody of the Mario formula. But even if the entire theme was redesigned, Apple still wouldn’t be happy: the company required an overhaul of the functionality of the game, to boot.And yet, when it comes to home-grown games, the company couldn’t care less about barefaced ripoffs. A search for “Threes Free” – a bestselling critically acclaimed hit from 2014 – puts the real game in second place behinda copy with the same gameplay and name. And that’s not even taking into accountthe success of Threes clone 2048.The list goes on. Migration gamePapers, Pleasewas forced to remove scenes in a full body scanner over “pornographic content”.Syria: Endgame, which looks at the civil war in that country, was removed for its political content. In A Permanent Save State, which attacks Apple over worker suicides at its manufacturing company Foxconn,was removed for– well, take a guess.But the oddest thing is that someone in Apple clearly does care. Way back in 2010, the company announced Game Center, its take on Xbox Live and other services that let gamers co-ordinate and play together, before letting it languish with barely any further support. Then, in 2014, it launched Metal, a graphics API squarely aimed at making high-fidelity games on iOS. That’s been front and centre at multiple Apple keynotes, and is getting ported on to OS X in September. There are games demoed at nearly every product launch, and, of course, there’s the money the company makes.Perhaps all the company needs is an executive visibly appointed as head of games, to steer the way and turn the sleeping giant of the games world into an active player. Or maybe the company will continue to tell people interested in games as an artform to “write a book”, all while carrying its bags of money to the bank.
When the Bird family give up technology on Sunday for the country’s first annual “National Unplugging Day”, 15-year-old James will be most worried about how his sister Charlotte, 13, will cope.“My sister will struggle more than anyone,” he said. “She relies on her phone so much. She’s always checking it – when we’re on the trampoline together, when we’re talking. She can’t go five minutes without it.”Debbie Bird says her children are fairly typical when it comes to using technology. She and her husband put restrictions on their children’s screen time, but both teenagers own laptops, iPhones and iPads, have multiple social media accounts and are “fixated” – Charlotte with her phone and James with his PlayStation 4.“My teenagers are fairly typical teenagers who would prefer to be on their phones or watching YouTube on their iPads than coming out walking with me and the dog,” said Debbie.Despite this, the Birds are determined to put down the phones and step away from the computer screens for 24 hours and will instead go camping, spending the day walking, swimming and doing archery.National Unplugging Day, a nationwide initiative by the website My Family Club, encourages families to go on a digital detox for a day and reconnect with each other offline. My Family Club’s founder and chief executive, Gemma Johnson, said she decided to launch the initiative last year after she was contacted by parents looking for advice on how to manage their children’s screen time and digital burnout.After a successful trial with 1,000 participants in 2014, this year National Unplugging Day has been registered as an official national day and been heavily promoted, primarily – and ironically – online. So far, more than 7,000 people have registered and pledged to go tech-free.Among them are Gemma Chase, her husband and two daughters, aged six and nine, from Buckinghamshire.“I think it’s such a brilliant initiative for families like ours who have two impressionable young children about to start the scary world of getting their own phones in a couple of years,” she said.She said the day is as much about getting parents off their devices and engaging with their kids as it is about loosening the children’s grip on the iPad.“I’m just really conscious we need to be setting our own example. We’re trying to establish ground rules with the kids now, but in a few years they’ll turn around to us and say ‘Hang on, you’re on Facebook at 7 o’clock, why can’t I be?’”Chase is so won over by the idea that she thinks she will make unplugging a weekly event. “My husband might struggle, but definitely for me and the children, if we can, we’ll do it every Sunday.”Debbie Bird says her children are ‘fairly typical teenagers who would prefer to be on their phones or watching YouTube on their iPads than walking with me and the dog’.Photograph: Paul RogersDr Richard Graham, consultant psychiatrist specialising in technology addiction at the Nightingale hospital in London says that as the research piles up regarding the mental, social, emotional and physical costs of spending so much time in front of screens, initiatives such as National Unplugging Day are valuable for allowing people to step back and examine their digital habits.“You don’t really understand the motivations for your connection to devices and the internet until you step away. We need in our culture, through policy or etiquette, to have spaces where you are given permission not to have to stay connected.“I used to see this with adolescents years ago when [messaging app] BBM was in ascendancy, that they would feel relieved to go on holiday somewhere without a signal – that way it’s not them choosing not to respond to people, it gives them permission to step away.“In a funny way we need rituals to manage the seductions and responsibilities of technology,” said Graham.National Unplugging Day is modelled on a US project, theNational Day of Unplugging, which was started in 2010 by Reboot, a Jewish cultural group, and encourages people to take a “technology Sabbath”. Both initiatives are part of a larger movement of shutting down and switching off, which has seenrestaurants ban mobile phonesand national parks offertechnology creches, so people can lock up their gadgets and enjoy the surroundings out from behind a screen.Last month, 1,500 people gathered for the first largescale screen-free music festival. AtInnocent Unplugged, held in a forest in Kent, there were no phones, no Wi-Fi and all electricity was solar-powered or kinetic, produced by festival-goers on bicylces and see-saws.“People loved it. It taps into an ever-increasing lethargy into being plugged in all the time. Everyone wanted to watch good bands without 79 screens in front of them or worrying about what filter on Instagram to use,” said Clemmie Nettlefold, PR manager at Innocent.Dr Graham says a day without technology can be extremely helpful as a step toward developing healthy technology habits.“The place we need to get to is one where we can move between offline and digital worlds and we’re in control, rather than bobbing on the ocean of messages and updates that sweep us this way and that.”
Everything’s easy once you’re used to it, so I try not to mention how long I normally spend figuring out the touch screen in cars, even though that accounts for roughly a third of my life. The Golf GTE (Gran Turismo Electricity) is brilliantly intuitive. Its technology is remarkable and it has five operating modes: pure electric, electric plus, battery hold, battery charge and auto hybrid. If they hadn’t managed to mask all that and make it easy to use, I would still be sitting in the car right now, waiting to move.The battery life display is a bit boastful and unrealistic, constantly claiming 16 miles and going six, though obviously that doesn’t matter in a hybrid that you can just switch to battery charge (unlike next week: a little electric-car cliffhanger for you there). This exaggeration – the claimed combined cycle is a preposterous 166mpg, which I didn’t get anywhere near – is softened by ridiculous riders telling you that you make your own bed with your “driving style, speed, use of additional electrical consuming equipment, outside temperature, number of people in the car, driving style selection and topology”. What they really mean to say is, “There must be a way to guesstimate hybrid range, but we don’t yet know it.”The electric acceleration has slightly more bounce in it than I’m used to: in parking manoeuvres, I often went maybe 20cm further than I was expecting. If I’m honest, I enjoyed the petrol drive fractionally more than the pure electric or the electric plus. It was simultaneously more predictable yet more exciting, genuinely sporty and curve-hugging, and it made the proper amount of noise. The car overall has a solid enough build that it’s quite quiet, but I still find the silence of electric-only eerie.And yet it darts elegantly, nippy and controlled. It is the first hybrid I’ve met with a cute plug hole. I must also be the first dolt on Earth who mentions this before getting to the awe-inspiring emissions: 39g/km, or roughly what you’d emit if you walked down the road smoking a cigar made of coal.The cockpit is self-explanatory, especially to the VW faithful, but with enough glamour to make you feel as though you’ve departed from your safe old Sharan. The sound system is brilliant (eight speakers!), the blue stitching fancy and the instrument cluster futuristic, especially when it glows. The exterior is really something, especially in white: youthful but not childish, and it looks ready for anything. It’s a car to be proud of, across a whole range of events (imagine, for brevity, a club night for environmentalists under the age of 25). The only thing is that it’s pricey – it’s hard to imagine the person who could afford it who wasn’t so grown up that they’d already grown out of having fun and bought a Prius. So now we’re looking for an environmentalist under 25, who is an entrepreneur or extremely spoilt.

“Got chased by a mob of taxi drivers who threw rocks,”tweeted the singer Courtney Lovefrom Charles de Gaulle airport. She was caught up in what is becoming a global trend: thebacklash against Uber. French taxi drivers were protesting on Thursday at vehicles operated by drivers working for the Californian business, which functions like a taxi-hire company, but via smartphones and without directly employing its drivers.Related:Uber expansion meets global revolt and crackdownThe taxi drivers were protesting at seeing their livelihoods threatened: it costs more than €100,000 (£71,000) for a taxi licence in Paris. Uber drivers, though, pay nothing, using their own cars and just paying a proportion of their takings to the company for the rides they pick up. There has been similar anger, though not riots, in New York where taxi licences, called “medallions”, can cost a million dollars. And regulators, courts and police have been raising concerns around the world, too.It’s been a tough week for Uber. The protests in France, where UberPop (as it is called locally) has been declared illegal yet still operates, came just a week afterCalifornia’s Labor Commissiondecided that Uber drivers there were employees, not contractors – a distinction that could impose significant costs and responsibilities. Uber had not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing.Uber’s troubles signal a troubled birth for a 21st-century concept: the sharing economy. In this brave new world, untapped capacity – such as idle cars and rooms – is made available for hire, increases efficiency and lowers the price of those goods and services.It is not just Uber that is facing resistance over the sharing phenomenon. Paris is also the scene of another collision between a company from the sharing economy and the authorities: about 2% of all apartment units in the city are available for rent throughAirBnB, which connects apartment owners and short-term renters. With 40,000 listings at the start of April, it’s the company’s largest market in Europe, ahead of London with just under 25,000 and Barcelona with 16,600.Investigators from Paris city hall have been trawling the city and can impose fines of €25,000 for any unlicensed short-term rental; in 2014, 20 owners of 56 leased properties were fined a total of €560,000. The fines come despite a deal made in March, whereby AirBnB would collect and pay tourist taxes for out-of-town visitors to apartments. Hotels, too, are angry at seeing their revenues eroded by the upstart.AirBnB has met resistance elsewhere too, usually from local governments concerned they are missing out on taxes. Barcelona and Berlin have both brought in tough regulations that will stifle AirBnB’s growth. But London, by contrast, relaxed old laws following a2014 government reviewof what might hold “sharing economy” companies back.Forecasts suggest such businesses will be huge: PriceWaterhouse Coopersforecast last yearthat total revenues for the five largest sharing economy businesses could be £9bn in the UK by 2025, and $335bn globally. If the taxi drivers of Paris and labor commission of California will let them, of course.“In some ways, the sharing economy is a throwback to the pre-industrial age, when village communities had to share resources to survive,” said John Hawksworth, PwC’s chief economist. “They built up trust through repeated interactions with people they had known all their lives.” Digital systems mean trust can work globally, and with people we’ve never met, he argued.But as Love discovered, the sharing economy can create significant tensions. Some view the taxi drivers’ anger as a repeat of the Luddite protests of 1811, when textile workers protested and smashed up labour-saving looms and frames, and just as doomed to fail.“These new services are more than just a cheaper alternative to traditional providers,”wrote the Los Angeles Times. “They’re a breakthrough for people who have something to offer the public but no way to do so effectively on their own.”By providing a platform for drivers, or part-time workers, or spare room owners, it argued, the new companies unleash new sources of economic activity that was previously suppressed.The deeper question though is whether such peer-to-peer systems erode wages and worker rights even while they create jobs. Uber claims drivers can earn significant amounts of money, but studies and undercover experiences by journalists have demonstrated that requires huge, or even impossible amounts of time.One writer discoveredthat to earn Uber’s promised median $90,000 a year after expenses in New York, she would have to work 365 days – each of 27 hours.Meanwhile, in Paris the biggest threat is that the taxi drivers will withdraw their labour – or sue their “employers” out of existence. With California having struck the first blow, there may be trouble ahead.A spokesman said: “Uber works very hard to provide a safe, reliable service. We are very focused on the safety of both riders and drivers so the violence is troubling and cannot be condoned. We understand the concerns and clearly need to do more to explain how new technology creates new job opportunities, which thousands of people throughout France are already using to earn a better living.“A million users of Uber in France already love the service. There are legal questions which the French Constitutional Court will answer and, while all recent decisions have been in favour of uberPOP, we will wait for that ruling. We are always happy to answer any questions authorities may have and we remain keen to sit and talk with the government to find a solution.”
The rapid global expansion of Uber has sparked interventions from taxi drivers and authorities around the world. “A city that welcomes Uber will be a better city,” said Uber chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Some cities and jurisdictions, disagree.Related:Uber backlash: taxi drivers' protests in Paris part of global revoltParisIn some of the most violent protests against Uber, 3,000 taxi drivers this week blocked main roads in Paris, including routes to airports, and burnt tyres. Taxi drivers also protested in Marseilles and other French cities. Bernard Cazenueve, France’s interior minister, declared Uber illegal andsaid Uber’s refusal to stop operating was cynical and arrogant. He said: “We are in a state of law and the law will rule.”In March, police raided Uber’s Paris offices to seize 1,200 mobile phones, computers and documents as part of an investigation into the UberPop service, which connects private drivers with passengers, and its use of customer data.LondonUp to 5,000 black-cab drivers blockaded London’s city centre in a protest against Uber last year. They argue that Transport for London lacks a clear policy on taxi-booking apps, and point out that that Uber’s drivers lack “the knowledge” – the gruelling test on London’s streets taken by aspiring cabbies. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, was abused by a cab driver over Uber operating in the city this month.Johnsonsaid this week it was not fair that black-cab drivers had to spend four years acquiring the knowledge and suggested Uber drivers could be made to pass language and geography tests.DelhiThe Indian capital banned Uber in December after awomansaid she was raped by one of the company’s drivers. The incident provoked outrage at Uber’s failure to check whether the driver had a clean police record. Uber claims that it has tightened the ways it carries out background checks on drivers and improved safety measures. Delhi’s transport department complained earlier this year that Uber was still operating, despite the ban. This month, police started enforcing the ban more rigorously by hailing cars from Uber and confronting them when they arrived. About 300 drivers from Uber and other banned services protested that the ban threatened their livelihoods.San FranciscoThe family of a six-year-old girl, struck and killed by one of its drivers in the company’s home city of San Francisco,is suing Uber and calling for a jury trialon charges including wrongful death and negligence. Uber deactivated the driver’s account after the crash and said he was not making a trip on the Uber system at the time. The family’s lawyer said: “Uber, though touting itself as the future of transportation, endangers public safety and has thrown transportation back into the wild-west era.” The company said it sympathised with the girl’s family but “did not cause this tragic accident”.Uber shut down its service inKansasafter state lawmakers voted through legislation that would force the company to carry out background checks on its drivers and carry additional car insurance.Members of a Chicago taxi drivers’ union circled City Hall for four hours in February, but refused to pick up passengers in protest against Uber, which they said siphoned 2m rides a month away from traditional cabs. Chicago has licensed Uber after it agreed to security measures for passengers, but established cab drivers said the rules favoured Uber.HangzhouAfter a confrontation between Uber drivers and local cab drivers in the regional capital, Uber instructed its drivers not to get involved in disputes and said it would monitor them electronically and fire those who disobeyed.Taxi drivers across China have protested against what they say is unfair competition from Uber. Following raids in Guangzhou, Chinese police last monthvisited Uber offices in Chengduin a widening investigation into the company’s operations inChina, where authorities have banned drivers of private cars from offering services through ride-hailing apps.AmsterdamUber drivers have been blocked by taxi drivers and one reported having his tyres slashed. A Dutch court banned UberPop in December and some unlicensed drivers have since been fined.MadridAfter the Madrid taxi association complained about Uber, a judge ordered the company to stop operating in Spain because drivers were unauthorised and taking part in unfair competition.BrusselsUber is illegal in Brussels and some of its drivers claim their cars have been vandalised. Brussels has announced plans to legalise Uber next year, but under strict regulation.MontrealThe Canadian province of Quebec regards Uber’s service as illegal and the city’s taxi bureau has cracked down, seizing cars from drivers.SydneyUber made itself unpopular when it increased fares during the Sydney hostage crisis last year. The New South Wales government declared Uber’s service illegal.• This article was amended on 3 July 2015. An earlier version said that black-cab drivers in London “argue that Uber is an unlicensed tax service”; Uber is a licensed private-hire operator in London.
All around there is chaos. Through the trenches dug into Hoth’s icy surface, rebel soldiers sprint toward uplink computers, as imperial snow troopers swarm around them. Blaster fire echoes across the desolate landscape, and the unmistakable swell of John Williams’s score builds to its familiar crescendo. You look up and there are two snow speeders zooming overhead tailing a TIE-fighter, their engines screaming. Your eyes follow the flightpath of these battling craft towards two hulking canine shapes in the distance.These are the AT-ATs, their hangdog heads scoping left and right looking for targets. The only way to stop them is to get the uplink stations working, temporarily shutting down the shields protecting these monstrous armoured transports. Then the rebels can call in a Y-Wing bomb attack to fell them, or order a lone pilot to shoot cables around their legs. But the snow troopers keep coming and no one can hold onto anything for very long.This is the Hoth attack map from Star Wars Battlefront, EA Dice’s take on the classic Star Wars shooter series, originally developed by Pandemic Studios for the PC and PlayStation 2. Best known for its Battlefield titles, Dice knows how to design compelling large-scale multiplayer conflict. But the studio came into this project facing three fan bases all ready to take offence: its own Battlefield fans, the Star Wars community and the veteran gamers who recall the original Battlefront titles with nostalgic reverence. There was a lot to get wrong.Then details of the game were revealed at the Star Wars Experience event in april, and controversy erupted. There would be no space battles, no characters or environments from the three prequel movies; there would be no Battlefield-style squads or customisable classes. There would be no single-player campaign, just a selection of themed maps with AI enemies.Star Wars Battlefront is a multiplayer and co-op focused game. But it is not Battlefield. And it is certainly not like the original Battlefront or its ambitious sequel, which mixed ground and space combat missions to thrilling effect. Cue pages of anger on the games forums.It’s nothing that Dice wasn’t expecting.“We knew it would be a cumbersome process – to create what we wanted to create,” says Patrick Bach, Dice’s general manager. “When we were asked to do this we were really scared. We thought, no, this is too intimidating. And we had enough in our pipeline to be able to say no. But on the other hand, your heart is screaming yes! Because of course you want to make a Star Wars game. We just thought, okay, we’ll figure it out as we go.”On the E3 showfloor, gamers queued for hours to get a 20-minute demo of Battlefront, which included a co-op mission and a large-scale multiplayer map. And yes, it was impressive. It was ... Star Wars.Related:Star Wars Battlefront – the quest to capture fan nostalgiaIn the co-op mission, entitled Survival on Tattooine, you and another player crash land on the planet’s craggy, inhospitable surface and have to survive six waves of increasingly aggressive, well-armed imperial soldiers (the final game features 15 waves). There are no classes to select from, no perks or items. In the demo you choose from four weapons that roughly correlate to first-person shooter arcehtypes. The A280C blaster is your basic all-round assault rifle, while the DH-17 pistol is more of a submachine gun, and the DLT-19 blaster rifle is the light machine gun.On top of this players get to chose two special abilities, one for each hand. There’s a jump pack that provides brief boosts into the air, a barrage of three grenades, a personal defence shield and an ion torpedo – essentially a vehicle-targeting homing missile. Then you’re out amid the desolate valleys and hilltops of the desert planet, waiting for the stormtroopers to arrive.The first wave is just a bunch of basic grunts, blasting in from the edges of the map, but then come the heavy gunners, and finally At-St walkers, stamping towards you. Even though this is basicHorde modestuff, it is ridiculously thrilling. Dice has captured everything from the reddish hue of the planet, to the shape and sounds of the weapons (those Ben Burtt noises perfectly recaptured) and the pulsating score. Stormtroopers move just like they do in the movies, and when they’re hit, they fall in the right way too. The map is large enough for you to race about looking for cover or cunning vantage points; but it’s small enough to ensure the action is frantic and demanding.A scout walker is attacked by two X-wing fighters, emphasising the game’s mix of air and ground combat.Photograph: Electronic ArtsAs well as surviving the attack waves, players also have a secondary job – to find and secure two escape pods that have landed nearby. This adds some tactical intrigue and focus to the action, encouraging players to work together, covering each other’s backs. There are also intermittent weapon drops, which may line you up with something devastating like a thermal imploder. These side elements are perhaps the main similarities to the complexity of Battlefield, but otherwise, Battlefront feels very different – almost retrospective in its avoidance of modern military FPS features.Really, the immediate joy is in just being there, in Star Wars, on Tatooine. “We looked at what Star Wars is,” says Bach. “Everything from the focus on the epic, to the technology, the weapons and gadgets, the worlds, the characters and how they behave. Then we added a level of game design that had the same spirit. Star Wars is a broad franchise, kids love it too. Battlefield is more mature, more hardcore. So the lighter theme in Star Wars is something we drew from. That doesn’t remove the depth or longevity, but it changes the way you look at how to get into the game and how to play it. That was very refreshing for us, to go through that process.”As for the full multiplayer experience – limited to 40 players, 20 on each side (rebels vs Empire, obviously) – it’s fascinating, but there are plenty of questions. The Hoth map, which has the rebels running down trenches trying to activate those terminals, while stormtroopers protect their AT-ATs, is thrilling and confusing in equal measure. The open landscape means you get a great sense of epic scale; looking out from any elevated point you can see skirmishes going on all over the place as the loping transports move in. However, spawn points can get clogged pretty quickly, and they’re easy to camp, making for lots of respawn slaughter.The rocket pack is super useful here, letting you blast out of hot zones very quickly, and making you feel like Boba Fett. And of course, the ability to pick up tokens that give you access to snow speeders or TIE-fighters, or let you become hero characters like Luke and Darth Vader (which you can control for a single spawn, making you feel uber powerful for a while like mini-killstreaks), changes the pace. But it will be interesting to see how these epic face-offs evolve as players become more adept. With no classes or squads to deploy, will there be enough strategic variety? Players can level up and gain access to new equipment, but without the regimentation of Battlefield, will it be a hot mess of differently skilled solo warriors?The other question of course is about size and scope. Battlefront will ship with 12 multiplayer maps and an as-yet unannounced range of co-op maps. There is a free DLC pack to follow, but there will certainly be paid instalments after that. Are we getting enough of a game in that first £50 offering? Bach certainly thinks so.“We’ve been building Battlefield games with a multiplayer focus for a very long time,” he says. “I would argue that we’ve never failed to provide longevity in those games. I’m guessing that we will not completely fail in doing that for Battlefront.”
