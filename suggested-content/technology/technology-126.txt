And so the Dark Knight returns once more. Rocksteady Studios, the London studio responsible for the critically acclaimed Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City adventures has announced its third and final title in a series that has redefined the super hero video game. Due out later this year Batman: Arkham Knight will be on the PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One only.And once again he’s up against a veritable army of super villains. This time Scarecrow is the lynchpin, assembling a diabolical collective that also includes Two-Face, Harley Quinn and Penguin, all determined to destroy Batman forever. In what publisher Warner Bros is referring to as the end of the trilogy, the scale has been ratcheted up with a fully explorable Gotham City, available to players in its entirety. Previous titles Arkham Asylum and Arkham City have featured only closed off sections of the metropolis.Further more, Arkham Knight will feature a new exclusive interpretation of the Batmobile, designed by the Rocksteady team. It will be the first time the iconic car has been available to drive in the series.Arkham Knight: cool car, big city, major troubleInterestingly, the game will be available on PC, PS4 and Xbox One only. “We’re excited to be developing the game for next-gen platforms,” said game director, Sefton Hill. “[It] has allowed us to bring to life the design elements that we envisioned from the beginning such as the Batmobile and how it augments Batman’s abilities, to the fully detailed and realized Gotham City.”Released in 2009, Arkham Asylum provided an authentic vision of the Batman universe and was acclaimed for its smooth controls and accessible combat mechanic. Co-written by DC author Paul Dini the story captured the gothic darkness of the best Dark Knight comics. The sequel, Arkham City, expanded the action to feature a whole area of Gotham, but retained the original’s style and atmosphere.The news of this third title will be bittersweet for fans – the prospect of another Rocksteady-developed adventure is exciting, but if this is the studio’s last it places a question mark over further Warner Bros Batman titles. Last year’s spin-off, Batman Arkham Origins, developed by Warners’ in-house studio in Montreal, was not as acclaimed as previous instalments. But then Batman is a comic book character well used to unexpected comebacks.
From style blogging to fashion magazines and tracking down lusted-after items, there really is an app for that.LIKEtoKNOW.itThe LIKEtoKNOW app lets Instagrammers buy clothes based on the outfits of their favourite stylists. Photograph: PRLaunched by the founders ofReward Style– a tool that allows bloggers to earn commission from brands on products featured on their site –LIKEtoKNOW.itaims to make it easier than ever for fashion followers to find out what their favourite bloggers are wearing and, more importantly, where to buy it.One signup with LIKEtoKNOW.it syncs the service with your Instagram account, allowing you to start accessing information instantly.If the users ”likes“ an Instagram picture of a blogger, details of the outfit the blogger is wearing are sent via email newsletter, complete with links to buy each item. Co-founder Amber Venz is a fan of a clean and uncluttered aesthetic which makes the emails and site a dream to navigate.The downside? Not all fashion bloggers – or indeed influential Instagram users – are signed up with the invitation-only service. But LIKEtoKNOW has an impressive number of bloggers using a service that only launched in December 2013 – not to mention the consumer following which is growing rapidly.The NetbookNatalie Massenet’s Net-a-Porter empire continues to grow and grow withnew fashion magazine, Porterthe most recent offering. But last year the company turned their attention to their own invitation-only social network.For those influential enough in fashion to be invited into the hallowed halls of The Netbook, an Instagram-meets-Pinterest-style social network is unveiled with the customary chic aesthetic ofNet-a-Porter’s online site.Clothes and accessories are beautifully laid out allowing members to ”like” images, which will then appear in the user’s profile and, the hope is, inspire them to buy certain items.The fun element comes from being able to seek out favourite celebrities, stylists, fashion editors and sneak a peek at what they’re liking, loving and buying right now.Snap FashionBuilt by British computer science graduate Jenny Griffiths, Snap Fashion allows users to snap a picture of something they like and search for similar products from over 300,000 items available on the UK high-street and online.Snap Fashionis available on mobile phone or on the web where users can paste a link to an image of the item they are after.With a mixture of high street brands such as Topshop, New Look and French Connection alongside department stores such as House of Fraser and John Lewis and online retailers including boohoo and The Outnet, the results provide products with a range of prices whatever the budget.Snap Fashion app Photograph: PRThe HuntShopping for many is a social event and if you’re wanting to share, socialise and kindly help others find what they’re looking for thenthe Huntmay be the app for you.The Hunt fashion app gives users the chance to crowd source information about the item they're after Photograph: PRSnap and upload the picture of the piece you’re after and the Hunt community will endeavor to track down that item.

My father, Richard Timberlake, a chartered civil engineer, who has died aged 71, was a transport director with the London-based Lebanese consulting companyDar Al-Handasahand spent a large part of his time in the Middle East and North Africa. One of his  first projects in the region involved the engineering design for the rapid expansion of the highway network in Saudi Arabia during the oil boom.Richard was seconded in the early 1990s to work on transport planning in Dubai, now one of the world's leading tourist destinations.A personal highlight of his career was being involved in 2004 in the crowd management of pilgrims taking part in the annual Hajj to Mecca. The replacement of the jamarat pillars with walls in the city of Mina, where pilgrims take part in ritual stone-throwing, and the building of theJamarat bridgehave allowed pilgrims to throw stones from either ground or bridge level without causing or sustaining injury.He was born in Brentwood, Essex, the son of Bert, a former district manager of Midlands Electricity Board, and his wife Elwena (nee Causer). Educated at Ashville college, Harrogate, and University College London, where he studied engineering, Richard began his career as a transport planner with Warwickshire county council. He was responsible for the design of several major new roads, including the Sutton Coldfield bypass, which required the use of some unique design and construction techniques.In the early years, Richard worked as a bridge engineer and gained chartered engineer status with the design of a bridge for the M6/M42 motorway intersection. He next became a director of a newly formed private research and development body, Planning and Transport Research and Computation. By 1974, PTRC had grown significantly, with one of its main clients being Dar Al-Handasah. In 1975, Dar established a new office in the UK and Richard, with some of his PTRC team, transferred across.He was the author of several publications on road alignment, optimisation techniques and the sustainable funding of new highways.Richard is survived by myself, his second wife, Jan, and two granddaughters.
Ever fancied the coat on the person next to you, or those shoes you were swooning over last week? If you’ve ever tried writing a description of it into Google, you’ll know that’s a fast track to despair.It’s handy, then, that there’s a new app attempting to bridge the gap between what you can see and what you can buy, with model of the moment Cara Delevingne supposedly a fan already.Available free on iPhone, theAsap54app combines visual recognition technology with a social community and a team of personal stylists. The app already has a waiting list and plans to limit the number of new accounts for the first few weeks; exclusivity is a sure-fire way to grab the attention of the fashion crowd.“The idea was born out of my frustration when searching to buy products online,” explains Asap54 founder, Daniela Cecilio, previously of online fashion marketplaceFarfetch. “I’m a very visual person and find it hard to describe what I see in words, so Googling emotions was a terrible exercise. I thought there has to be an easier and quicker way.”The Asap54 iPhone app combines visual recognition technology, crowdsourcing and a team of in-house personal stylists. Photograph: PRUsers snap and upload a picture of an item or look they’re after, whether it’s a designer dress seen in a magazine or a swatch of fabric, then select the type of item they’re after, such as shoes, dress or trousers.The app searches an exact match in its database, or suggests a range of related products, and click-through to buy. It’s designed to be faster and easier than a search engine.The London-based startup has already attracted investment from prominent retail, tech and publishing venture capital firms including e.ventures, Ceyuan Ventures and Novel TMT, as well as angel investors such as Carmen Busquets and Frederic Court.Net-a-Porter, Barneys, Harrods, J Crew, Topshop and The Outnet are among the fashion retailers on the apps database, which is expected to grow as the service develops. An in-house team of personal stylists are also on hand for when the app fails to satisfy with its initial results. Users are able to notify a stylist who will manually search and deliver five suggestions via email within 24 hours.Asap54 isn’t a totally new concept –The Huntapp, launched late last year, has already been providing a platform for fashion fans to crowd source information on unidentified pieces of clothing andSnap Fashion, brainchild of computer science graduate Jenny Griffiths, allows users to take a picture of an item of clothing and find similar items from high street retailers. Users can also track items when they hit the sales rack.Asap54 is hoping its social network component differentiates it from the competition; users can build a profile, posting past searches and follow others to see what pieces people are looking for.Despite an impressive roster of fashion brands on its books already, the app doesn’t cover every item or brand, but says its range will grow as its business expands. An initial search can bring back a mixed bag of goodies – a search for a simple stripey top brought back results varying from around £10- £1,000.The Asap54 iPhone app allows users to search for a variety of shopping ideas using a simple picture. Photograph: PRBut image searches are not just limited to items of clothing; the app will return results on a particular shade of a single flower or even the colour of an insect’s shell. It will seek to find clothing and accessories harnessing the same palette, print or pattern.Testing out the app, a friend and I snapped a picture of a duvet to be presented with selection of shirts harnessing a variation of floral prints within seconds.Although the app has quickly been likened to Shazam – the app that identifies the title of a song based on an audio clip – searching for an exact match for items of clothing is notoriously tricky. The positioning of an item, lighting and camera angles can all make a big difference.•Fashion ‘too scared to innovate with tech’, says ex Topshop marketing chief
Gaming giant Nintendo is to target the booming health sector as a way to turn around its struggling business, president Satoru Iwata has told investors.Resisting pressure from shareholders and industry critics to re-focus its business on mobile gaming, Iwata described the health industry as an expanding business. He pledged to use it in a similar manner to Nintendo’s traditional video games to make people “conscious about their health” and “to put smiles on people’s faces around the world”.“We have set health as the theme for our first step and we will try to use our strength as an entertainment company to create unique approaches that expand this business,” said Iwatain a letter to shareholders and investors.“We have decided to redefine entertainment as something that improves people’s quality of life in enjoyable ways and expand our business areas. What Nintendo will try to achieve in the next 10 years is a platform business that improves people’s quality of life in enjoyable ways,” he said, adding that Nintendo still wanted to “provide products and services which pleasantly surprise people”.Motion gaming for yearsNintendo has been dabbling with health accessories and games for years, producing two heart rate monitors as well as a series of Wii Fit games and accessories, including a weigh scale or “balance board”.The original Wii console also went to some lengths to get gamers off the sofa and moving about, both for a new motion gaming experience but also for fitness and activity benefits.The company originally announced its health-focused strategy during its weak earnings call in January, where it promised to wow customers with health-related innovations to turn around the business, dismissing calls to take Nintendo games onto mobile phones.The Nintendo president said that the company “will continue to provide products and services which pleasantly surprise people” through “new endeavours with the quality-of-life-improving platform” although he failed to elaborate on what form those products could take.Nintendo has previously denied the possibility of selling a wearable device, such as a fitness tracker or smartwatch.Traditional gaming consolesDespite Nintendo’s reinvigorated health drive, Iwata was careful to reiterate that traditional gaming consoles were still Nintendo’s primary business strategy, despite the Wii U missing sales targets by a wide margin.“We believe that we can capitalise the most on our strengths through a hardware-software integrated platform business, and therefore this type of dedicated video game platform will remain our core focus,” Iwata explained.The statements come in the face of a bleak financial outlook, as the company is expecting to make a 25bn Yen loss (£147m) for the 12 months in 2014 through to December, a reversal of the 55bn Yen profit originally expected.Nintendo slashed its annual forecast for Wii U sales by 69% from 9m to just 2.8m, having sold 2.4m of the consoles April through till December last year, while the Nintendo 3DS handheld video game console fared little better, with forecasts slashed by 25% to 13.5m from 18m for the year.• The Wii U is failing,but mobile isn’t the answer for Nintendo
A bitcoin bank has been forced to close after hackers stole 896 bitcoin, worth £365,000, in an attack on Sunday.The company shut its website and posted a statement on Tuesday morning detailing the loss.“On March 2nd 2014 Flexcoin was attacked and robbed of all coins in the hot wallet,” the statement read. “As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately.”Not all of the company’s assets were stolen. In line with best practices for running a bitcoin financial service, Flexcoin held some bitcoins in “cold storage”, keeping them on devices not connected to the internet. Those bitcoins are safe, but only users who explicitly requested their bitcoins be held in cold storage (and paid a 0.5% fee) benefit.“Users who put their coins into cold storage will be contacted by Flexcoin and asked to verify their identity,” the statement continues. “Once identified, cold storage coins will be transferred out free of charge. Cold storage coins were held offline and not within reach of the attacker. Flexcoin will attempt to work with law enforcement to trace the source of the hack.”Flexcoinattempted to impose a more conventional banking system over the top of the bitcoin network, enabling instant free transfers between Flexcoin customers while still allowing them to spend money in the wider bitcoin community.Just six days ago, the company was boasting that it was unscathed by the closure of MtGox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange:We hold zero coins in other companies, exchanges etc. While the MtGox closure is unfortunate, we at Flexcoin have not lost anything.&mdash; flexcoin (@flexcoin)February 25, 2014Flexcoin’s closure reinforcesthe problem the bitcoin community has with security.The same day the company came clean about its losses, a second bitcoin firm, Poloniex,also admittedthat 12.3% of its reserves had been stolen by hackers. Poloniex is a bitcoin exchange, and the company has committed to operating at a fractional reserve until it can replenish the losses itself.“I sincerely apologize for this,” Poloniex’s owner wrote in a statement, “and I am very grateful to the many people who have already expressed their support and belief in my character. I take full responsibility; I will be donating some of my own money, and I will not be taking profit before the debt is paid.”Flexcoin’s closure follows that of MtGox’s, blamed on hackers stealing 750,000 bitcoins by exploiting a bug known as “transaction malleability”. Several other bitcoin businesses, both high- and low-profile, have gone under. Services includingBitcoinica,Inputs.ioandMyBitcoinhave all been hacked, each losing thousands of bitcoins.•Why the bitcoin community is fighting to fix its security problem
Facebook is reportedly in discussions to acquire Titan Aerospace, a manufacturer of drones, for around $60m.Titan Aerospace specialises in solar-powered, very high flying drones capable of staying airborne for five years at a time, positioned as a more cost-effective alternative to orbital satellites dubbed as “atmospheric satellites”.The talks,confirmed by technology site TechCrunch, indicate that Facebook is likely interested in these satellite alternative drones that fly as high as 20km in altitude as part of its Internet.org initiative.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg took to the stage at Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress in February to elaborate on the Internet.org coalition’s plans to connect the next five billion people to the internet in developing nations. The drones could be used to blanket large areas of Africa and other countries with internet access.A source told TechCrunch that Titan Aerospace would be fully committed to the Internet.org project post acquisition, and would start building 11,000 drones for the effort.New type of drone called an ‘atmostat’Titan Aerospace was founded in 2012, with research and development facilities in New Mexico, aiming to create a new type of drone called an “atmostat”, which could fulfil the role of a near-Earth satellite at a fraction of the cost and without needing to be launched into orbit.Zuckerberg has stated that Facebook will have long-term involvement with the Internet.org project and that it was willing to spend significant amounts of money without a likely return on investment in the near future.“It’s easy to take for granted that most people have access to the internet, but only one third of the world, 2.7 billion people, currently have access to the internet,” said Zuckerbergin his MWC keynote.“We’re not on a path to connect everyone right now, unless something dramatic changes.”Mobile internet data subscribers number in the 1.2 billion in developing nations, far outstripping the 357m fixed broadband connections in those same countries, meaning that mobile data outnumbers fixed broadband by over 3:1 in the developing world.The Titan Aerospace drones could provide an ideal platform for expanding the footprint of the mobile broadband, and help Facebook both connect more people and expand its user base in developing markets like Africa.Titan Aerospace has yet to respond to the Guardian’s request for confirmation.• Mark Zuckerberg:Facebook’s future is to reach the next billions of mobile users
Near the beginning of South Park: The Stick of Truth you're given the choice between four character "classes", a familiar trope in role-playing games. In this case you can be a Fighter, a Mage, a Thief, or a Jew – and if you plump for the last, Cartman emphasises that you probably can't be friends, but maybe you can take care of the guild's finances.South Park's humour has never been close to the bone so much as breaking it, then gleefully sucking out the marrow while dancing on the pieces. By far the best thing about The Stick of Truth is its script and willingness to go places that other games don't, whether that's the range of exotic dildos and crack pipes in Cartman's Mom's bedroom or the cavalcade of mental and physical and ethnic distinctions among its extensive cast. This is the game of a series that doesn't care if jokes are appropriate, as long as they're funny.I'm not going to ruin the best gags, not least because they wouldn't get past the editor, but a huge part of their impact comes from The Stick of Truth looking and sounding so much like the cartoon. South Park's simple visual style and crude animation is captured perfectly in every part of the game outside of battles, and an especially nice touch is the character customisation – you set up a character at the beginning, but then acquire several wardrobe's worth of clothes, hats and beards while playing, all of which can be equipped and then seen in the town, combat and cut scenes.Cartman vs MarioCombined with a fourth-walling script centered around your mute character, who Cartman calls Douchebag and later Sir Douchebag, it's a powerful anchor into a world so bizarre and packed it's hard to keep track of. It would be easy to go on and on about the sheer South Parkiness of The Stick of Truth, because this is its most important quality. But underneath it is a slightly underwhelming RPG, based more than anything on Nintendo's Mario &amp; Luigi handheld series, where progression through multiple quest lines amounts to little more than following arrows around a (beautiful, funny, interactive) overworld.This is no great criticism because the missions keep on coming with a very high standard of dialogue and cut scenes, but is does raise the question: are you playing a game or a cartoon in which a bit of button-pressing occurs? The biggest argument against it is the combat system, which has depth but takes an awfully long time to start showing it. Combat takes the form of turn-based battling with timing elements – so at the right moment of an attack animation, press the button to drive home the blow. Soon enough you have a wide range of offense, as well as several buddies to call upon, and certain genre-skewering special moves like the Dragonborn's mighty farts.This is all a lot of fun to watch and even play, but I didn't lose a battle in my time with the game until I eventually unlocked the forests outside of South Park – a good ten hours in, at least. This isn't necessarily a game you'd play for the challenge, it was never going to be Dark Souls with fart gags, but many players will expect more than a cakewalk through a South Park episode.The battle system also translates very roughly to a gamepad, as do the otherwise excellent menu screens and character customisation. The game is clearly designed for a mouse and keyboard interface, which has then been manhandled onto console – it's not something that is ever a gigantic problem, but if you have the luxury of choosing then go for the PC version.Game for a laughThe lack of challenge in the battle system hints at one of the real issues with The Stick of Truth. The game is much more simple than it looks, and even the humour is often only skin-deep. Though you can pick a Jew as your class, and I did, all this means is you're choosing a "normal" RPG class with special moves that use Dredels and have names like Jew-Jitsu. The joke is that you're a Jew, and certain South Park characters hate Jews, and don't we live in an antisemitic world even now kids – but after daring to go this far, all The Stick of Truth really has in the locker is a few bad puns and bespoke Cartman lines.But then that's South Park, isn't it? There are many parts of this game – talking in Jimbo's gun shop, listening to Rob Schneider adverts, or watching a line of sieg-heiling foetuses - where I had to stop playing because I couldn't stop laughing. If any game ever challenged the old distinction between graphics and gameplay this is it, because simple as its systems are, and even as dull as the fetch-questing can sometimes be, the look and script and voice-acting carry this rocketing over the finish line – as well as through the taste barrier. In some ways this game is to the RPG genre what the animated series is to celebrity voice overs: a comic impersonation. As far as the comedy goes, however, Stick of Truth is fuckin-A dude.
Encryption and security specialists Silent Circle has teamed up with Geeksphone, a joint project between security-conscious developers, entrepreneurs and ex-special forces operatives, to launch a new mobile phone that claims to give users back control of their data and lets them “determine what data they want to reveal, rather than be forced”.On the face of it, the Blackphone does exactly that. For $629 (£377), customers get a smartphone that includes one year’s subscription to secure communication service Silent Circle and a virtual private network (VPN) for secure browsing, a ”remote wipe” anti-theft feature, a firewall and a year’s subscription to 5GB of secure cloud storage.It also has no sign-up process, no ecosystem like Android or iPhone has (although it runs a modified Android OS) and a Blackphone specific app-store that is on the way, although users can still download apps from the Google Play Store or third party apps unrelated to Google.As 2014 smartphones go, it also has a reasonably decent specifications including a 2Ghz quad-core processor, 16GB on-board storage, 2GB of RAM and an 8MP camera.But, perhaps the most interesting feature is the security manager app which lets you manage what data regular apps can harvest from your phone. During a demonstration of the security manage app, Blackphone’s vice president of engineering David Purón pointed out that a simple barcode scanning app was accessing his contacts list.“There’s no reason for it to do that, right?” he asked. “So all I need to do is press ‘restrict’ and it can no longer access my contacts - but the app will continue to work as normal.”While it’s disquieting to think that single purpose apps like a barcode scanner are exploiting their access to data, it’s the lack of public awareness that the Blackphone team are hoping to highlight when the device comes to market this summer.Even with data restriction for apps and secure browsing, some companies can still build up a picture of the activity you generate on your phone. A perfect example is Polystar, a Swedish “network monitoring” company that measures internet traffic and sells the data to telecommunications companies. Polystar looks at how much bandwidth you’re using and at what time of the day, and can tell that you’re watching a couple episodes of House of Cards, or a cat do something hilarious on YouTube. You can never really escape someone looking over your virtual shoulder.Can a mobile phone really be hack proof?One of a new wave of hardware and software services claiming to offer enhanced security and privacy in the wake of theEdward Snowden revelations, early coverage of Blackphone described it as ”NSA proof“. The Blackphone team has since rowed backwards on that claim, acknowledging that any such claim is likely to be short-lived.“Yes, of course you can protect yourself from spying agencies, that’s true,” said Purón. “But in this privacy and security industry, no one can say that something is 100% secure. Anyone who says that is lying. So in terms of the NSA, or any other government agency that wants to break that phone, they will be able to. Nothing is 100% NSA proof.”The NSA, or any other security agency that wanted to hack the phone, would attempt to exploit the one major security flaw that exists in the Blackphone – the phone’s baseband.A phone’s baseband is essentially a black box that communicates with a cell tower and has low-level access to your GPS and microphone. The baseband is entrenched hardware in your phone, which has its own CPU and operating system and is entirely vulnerable to attacks. The Blackphone doesn’t protect against this.Stephen Bonner from KPMG’s information protection team also thinks that the phone’s focus on privacy is another security flaw in itself.“By owning a Blackphone a user could become a target because it acts as a red flag to criminals by highlighting that there’s something to hide. As the devices attract and house high value data, attackers will be inclined to break in,” said Bonner.“Some of the threats these type of products aim to protect against aren’t realistic for most users. They might be a cool gadget for wannabe James Bonds but business users need to worry a lot more about the applications on their device and the end-to-end protections they have in place.”The Blackphone team doesn’t pretend to offer NSA-level security – few companies do – but wants to appeal to corporate users as well as individuals, exploiting concern over corporate espionage in “hostile environments”, Bonner explains.The Blackphone team argues that it isn’t for people who wear tin foil hats and communicate entirely via tin-can telephone, and it might not be James Bond’s go-to gadget. But it is for people who are unhappy with the everyday phenomenon of brazen and unchecked data mining.•Fears of patient data leak prompt inquiry into mapping website
A student at London’s Imperial College has been using his university’s computers to mine Dogecoin, the meme-based cryptocurrency.According to the bitcoin news site Coindesk, the anonymous student has been accessing Imperial’s computer lab every evening and setting the computers to work, using their processing power to run the algorithms that bring new Dogecoins into existence.“I’ve not had a single issue yet,”he told Coindesk’s Kadhim Shubber, “so I’ve kept scaling up! It seems they don’t have anything set up to bring attention to the fact I’m maxing out the CPUs, which is nice.”The student has reportedly made 30,000 Dogecoin in the mining operations so far, worth around £20.Mining any cryptocurrency is a computationally expensive process, which not only renders the device unusable for other reasons but can rack up electricity bills and put computers at risk of overheating. For that reason many establishments ban the use of shared computers to mine the currency.The problems at Imperial College follow Harvard University, where a student was disciplined in February for mining Dogecoin using the university’s Odyssey supercomputer.The university permanently blocked the individual in question from all research computing facilities, saying their actions were “strictly prohibited for fairly obvious reasons”.•Bitcoin being used to trade child abuse material, IWF warns
It's Tuesday.
A service offered by a data mapping website was closed down on Monday, as health authorities launched an investigation into the site amid concerns it had apparently acquired millions of identifiable patient records without regulatory scrutiny.A Hertfordshire-based online mapping company,Earthware, which offers services including property data, hosted a tool which could allow users to locate an area in England where a single individual had gone for specialised treatment.Although this would not necessarily pinpoint the patient involved, the risk of identification is considered so high that data protection rules prohibit the release of information when fewer than five individuals are involved. The website offered a free service to sample the tool's usefulness, which allowed the public to search for heart and respiratory conditions.In a statement, the firm insisted the map contained "mock data".On Monday night theHealth and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC)said the website tool had been shut down and an investigation launched into how the data had been obtained, as it had not been cleared by its regulatory process.A spokesman for the information centre said: "The link to this tool has been taken down following a request by the HSCIC. We are investigating urgently the source of the data used and whether controls demanded of any organisation using data have been maintained. After this investigation we will take any necessary action."In astatement issued on its website, Earthware said it was "confident that we have not breached any legal or regulatory rules regarding the licensing or publication of[Hospital Episode Statistics]data".It said that the map displayed mock data held by a third party; that the company had never held HES data on its servers and that no patient-identifiable data was ever displayed on the map. "We will continue to co-operate fully with the HSCIC if required," it concluded.The investigation comes amid concerns that there are potentially companies in the UK able to create data dossiers on patients by tapping new technologies to unearth ever more intimate information about the public. The dataset apparently came from hospital episode statistics, which hitherto had been considered a relatively "safe" repository of sensitive data.NHS England has previously defended its flagship care.data scheme – which proposes to extract data from GP surgeries – by pointing out that for 25 years hospital statistics had not suffered a major breach of privacy. Roll-out of the scheme wasput on hold in February for six months.Phil Booth of medConfidential, which campaigns on medical privacy, told the Guardian that "NHS England officials have claimed again and again that there has been no misuse of hospital episode statistics. Now a commercial real estate web mapping company appears to be getting access to hospital patient-level data."Booth called for a "full transparent" disclosure of all the hospital data so far released and called for the care.data scheme to be "halted". "Until there has been a full transparent audit of every release of patient data the entire system that they propose must be halted."Under care.data, unless patients opt out, the HSCIC will extract a person's NHS number, date of birth, postcode, ethnicity and gender. Once the system is live, organisations such as university research departments – but also insurers and drug companies – will be able to apply to the HSCIC to gain access to the database. If an application is approved then firms will have to pay to extract this information, which will be scrubbed of some personal identifiers but not enough to make the information completely anonymous – a process known as "pseudonymisation".This week Jeremy Hunt will push through a number of amendments to the Care bill related to protecting privacy.The coalition will create a new law that would bar any company that obtains patient information under the care.data programme and uses it in a malicious way from ever bidding to use medical records again. Hunt also proposes that the NHS's confidentiality advisory group, which advises the health secretary on accessing confidential patient data without consent – be made a statutory body.Earlier on Monday, Sarah Wollaston, who practised as a family doctor and is now a Tory MP on the health select committee, questioned how the NHS hospital patient database for England washanded to management consultants who uploaded it to Google servers based outside the UK.Wollaston tweeted: "So HES [hospital episode statistics] data uploaded to 'google's immense army of servers', who consented to that?"The patient information had been obtained by PA Consulting, which claimed to have secured the "entire start-to-finish HES dataset across all three areas of collection – inpatient, outpatient and A&amp;E".The data set was so large it took up 27 DVDs and took a couple of weeks to upload. The management consultants said: "Within two weeks of starting to use the Google tools we were able to produce interactive maps directly from HES queries in seconds."Experts said there were concerns over the fact that data can easily be shared in the Google system - and that the danger of an accidental data leak would have catastrophic consequences for trust.In astatementPA Consulting Group said it had purchased the data from the predecessor of the HSCIC. "The data set does not contain information linked to specific individuals. The information is held securely in the cloud in accordance with conditions specified and approved by HSCIC."TheHSCICsaid: "PA Consulting used a product called Google BigQuery to manipulate the datasets provided and the NHS IC was aware of this.

Child abuse material is being stored, shared and sold by criminals hacking innocent sites on the open web, who are then using the cryptocurrency bitcoin to sell the material.Research by theInternet Watch Foundation(IWF) has discovered the emergent use of the bitcoin digital currency as a payment mechanism, with criminals hiding images and video on hacked websites that are unknowingly hosting the illegal content.“This is the first time we’ve seen bitcoin be purported to be accepted as the only payment for child sexual abuse on the open web and not hidden in the dark web,” said Sarah Smith, technical researcher at the Waterbeach-based IWF and author of the report.The report, published Monday, details how the IWF found a hacked website hosting a page within an orphan folder – one not linked to from the main, legitimate website on the server – that automatically redirected to another hacked website, this time one hosting a commercial child sexual abuse website inside another orphan folder.A significant proportion of the compromised websites hosting child abuse material seem to be UK businesses, but not necessarily hosted in the UK.The web links leading to the seller of the illicit images were being distributed, hidden within spam emails.‘Started to see a resurgence’The technique of hiding content on hacked servers was originally popular in 2010, but the popularity of free cloud storage sites saw the trend die out.“Around about June 2013 we started to see a resurgence in this technique of using folders on hacked websites to distribute child abuse sexual content or websites,” explained Smith.Free, off-the-shelf hacking tools for vulnerable websites, as well as hackers for hire, have made it straightforward for criminals to hijack legitimate personal or small business sites. There has been a sharp rise is hijacking sites in this way, which circumvents the internet filters championed by David Cameron, according to Smith.“Over the past couple of weeks, since spotting the first site, we have received reports of many other sites using similar techniques and the same template of commercial child sexual abuse site accepting bitcoin,” said Smith.Most of the hacked sites will have no knowledge of the intrusion and will be totally unaware that the illicit material is being stored and served from their servers. Basic security of websites and servers is of paramount importance to prevent abuse, which could lead to consequences for the unwitting owners of the compromised websites.•Missing: hard drive containing Bitcoins worth £4m in Newport landfill site
Twitch Plays Pokémon (TPP), the crowdsourced attempt to play Pokémon Red where players yell commands into a chat window alongside 100,000 other players doing the same, successfully finished the game on Saturday morning.Using online live-streaming service Twitch, TPP asks viewers to control the game by typing the commands they want to be input into the chat window alongside.Despite some setbacks– such as a 20-second delay on the stream and a persistent problem with “griefers”, who deliberately attempt to frustrate any progress – the players managed to beat the Elite Four and Pokémon Champion, the game’s final bosses in just over 16 days over consecutive playtime.But the event is not over: after a one-day break, Pokémon Crystal, the third game of the second generation of Pokémon games, began.The creator of TPP (who has remained anonymous throughout the game) told the Guardian they were “very happy that the stream managed to reach a conclusion”.“I wasn’t sure if that was going to be possible when I started… [but] once they got to the Elite Four I knew it was only going to be a matter of hours. I was sleeping at the time of the battle but woke up during the credits.”The Pokémon Crystal stream began on Sunday morning. After 26 hours, the players have already earned the first of eight gym badges, taught a pokémon cut, and engaged in a war over whether or not to evolve Totodile, their starting Pokémon.The curious can follow the gameon the twitch channel,the Reddit live thread, or usinga new chrome extension.•Twitch Plays Pokémon: live gaming’s latest big hit
Since the industrial revolution, Britain has been a cradle of invention. From railways connecting our cities to the world wide web connecting our globe, Britain can take pride in its part in the development of many of the technologies that have transformed our lives.Even at the dawn of the technological revolution – from radio and television to the computer – Britain was playing a key role. But in recent years, the most significant technological innovations have happened elsewhere. Today, as more and more of us are learning what technology can do and how to use it, fewer people are learning how to build it.The reality is that for all Britain’s proud heritage, we’re not as good as we were at nurturing the skills and talent that are needed to be at the leading edge of innovation. That needs to change.Computer science as a skill is declining, and Britain is falling behind. The UK currently ranks 32nd globally in terms of the percentage of population that are computer engineers, lagging behind Slovenia and Romania. In fact, there has been a near 60% decline in the number of people taking computer science A-Level since 1998.Technology breakthroughs can’t happen without the engineers to build them. And I’m not just talking about tech companies like Google. As an engineering company we will always need talented engineers, but technology is no longer the sole preserve of start-ups and software companies. Companies from architecture to manufacturing are using and relying on technology to run their businesses. This, in turn, creates jobs and value to the economy: digital employers hire 15% more people on average than those who are not digital. By2015, there will be an estimated 900,000 unfilled ICT positions in the EU.Britain today does not lack for smart people with the potential to lead the next wave of invention. At Google in London, I’m lucky enough to sit among some of the brightest technological minds in the world.Like many of my colleagues, my own interest in computers started from a young age, long before I was thinking about career options. Since I was four, I’ve been fascinated with how things work - pulling things apart and then putting them back together again. I’ve introduced my son and daughter to coding too and they love playing with Scratch, a free programming language for creating your own games.I want to see more children across the country excited about computer science, but to make this happen we need to start early. If we can get children interested and give them the help they need to turn these skills into a career, we’ll end up with more computer scientists. Google work with many partners from Raspberry Pi, to Young Rewired State, to Code Club and Teach First who get young people exposed to, and involved with, programming.This week we’re also celebratingHour of Codewhich aims to persuade as many students and their parents as possible to try computer coding for at least 60 minutes during that week. We know you can’t learn to code in an hour. Like most skills, it’s not that easy. But you can spark interest and excitement in an hour and there are lots of organisations ready to support children to take the next step after that.Thanks to initiatives like these, the UK today is beginning to close the gap in tech skills. Computer science is coming on to the primary school curriculum for the first time in September, making the UK one of only two G20 countries to make this investment. This is a fantastic development but it’s also a huge challenge. More than 200,000teachers will be affected by the curriculum changes. That gives us about six months to get them ready. We’re working withCode Club Proto launch the first teacher-training scheme of its kind, but much more needs to be done to equip teachers with the skills they need to inspire the next generation of programmers and developers.We want to see more ground-breaking technology invented right here in Britain. To do that, we need to continue to invest in computer science education and help students, teachers and parents understand its importance in our lives.We need to make sure innovation is part of the UK’s future and not just our history.•Mike Warriner is UK engineering director of Google
Apple has launched its assault on thein-car technology market by announcing a product called CarPlay, which it hopes will integrate the iPhone, Apple maps and Siri into the car dashboard.Announced at the Geneva International Motor Show,CarPlayis the next evolution of Apple’s iOS in the Car, which connected iPhones to car stereos via the now obsolete docking connector that featured on iPhones and iPods up until the release of the iPhone 5 with the newer, smaller Lightning Connector.What is it?CarPlay is a more advanced way to connect an iPhone to a car’s entertainment and information systems, allowing access to a variety of the smartphone’s functions including music, messaging and navigation.How does it work?Like existing cars with iPod or iPhone connections, cars fitted with the new Apple CarPlay will connect to iPhones using the Lightning Connector, pulling data and information directly from the iPhone and charging it in the process.The iPhone can be controlled via voice, or through the car’s native touchscreen interface mounted in the dashboard or with traditional buttons including those mounted on the steering wheel.Will it let me do more than play music?CarPlay will allow music and music apps like Spotify to be played through a car's stereo.CarPlay goes far beyond previous in-car iPhone connections including an “eyes-free” interface through Apple’s voice assistant, Siri, accessed by a touch of the voice control button mounted on the steering wheel.Like most other in-car connections, CarPlay will allow drivers to access the music and radio content through the car’s stereo, including iTunes Radio, Spotify and other third-party music applications. Tracks can be found manually, or via a spoken request for a track or artist to Siri.Using Siri, drivers will also be able to access messages and have them read aloud, reply via voice, access their contacts on the iPhone and make calls, as well as a variety of other voice commands including music controls.What about navigation?CarPlay also leverages Apple’s mapping service. The system will be able to use Apple Maps to anticipate destinations based on recent trips and information sifted from contacts, emails and text messages in a similar manner to Google’s Now digital assistant.It can then provided turn-by-turn directions, displayed on the car’s dashboard screen, as well as traffic information and estimated time of arrival. Drivers can use Siri to plot routes and get directions via voice.Apple Maps will be displayed on the car's integrated screen, pulled directly from the iPhone with voice directions via Siri.Do I need a special car?CarPlay requires special, bespoke equipment supporting Apple’s iPhone to be fitted into cars, which means that car manufacturers will have to build it in at the factory.Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo all announced that CarPlay would be fitted to certain new cars this week in Geneva, but many other manufacturers also announced support would be coming for Apple’s new iPhone connectivity system in the near future.BMW, Ford, General Motors (Vauxhall in the UK), Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Land Rover, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Peugeot, Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota all announced that they are working on integrating Apple’s CarPlay down the road.When will it be available?CarPlay will be available in a small select number of vehicles from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo starting this year, with more adding compatibility with the system at a later date as car models get updated.What will it work with?As CarPlay uses the Lightning Connector, it will require an iPhone 5, iPhone 5S or iPhone 5C to work, meaning that the iPhone 4S or earlier cannot be used with the new in-car system. Compatibility for the CarPlay system will be made available via an iOS 7 software update at a later date.What are the alternatives?Apple is by no means the only company working on this kind of smartphone integration into the car.Google launched its own purpose-built Android-based car system initiative earlier this year called theOpen Automotive Alliance(OAA), which includes Audi, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai and Nvidia, manufacturer of the Tegra 4 processor that powers several Android tablets and smartphones.The OAA aims to develop systems that enable developers to easily add car-specific modes to their apps to “bring the best of Android into the automobile in a safe and seamless way”Microsoft also has a system called Microsoft Sync to connect smartphones to in-car entertainment and the dashboard. It employs limited voice control functionality, but can pull contacts and other data from a smartphone to manage calls and messages. It is currently available in a range of cars, including many of Ford’s current vehicles like the Fiesta and Focus.What does this mean for car technology?Car technology, especially entertainment and information systems, are almost always out of date before they hit the road. That is primarily because the technology they are built on has to be rigorously tested and stand the test of time, and therefore does not change quite as rapidly as mobile devices.As devices like mobile phones and tablets improve in leaps and bounds, they leave in-car technology behind, making it look and feel outdated in a matter of years, if not months. By centring a car’s information systems around a smartphone, like the iPhone, it unlocks the possibility of updating how the system feels and behaves much more rapidly than a standard fixed in-car system.Apple’s move shows that the company is aggressively going after the car as the next extension of the iPhone, having identified it as yet another way to lock users into Apple’s ecosystem.The more extensions of the iPhone Apple can add to a user’s life, the harder it will be to move away from Apple’s iPhone and its software and music ecosystem, adding yet more inertia against switching to competing platforms like Google’s Android or Microsoft’s Windows Phone.Apple has also identified the car as an area of growth into which it can push its Apple Maps app and data service, competing with both Google and Nokia’s Here maps for users, data and potentially advertising revenue.By announcing that CarPlay will be available in vehicles from a myriad of car manufacturers this year, Apple has dealt the competition from OAA and Microsoft a heavy first-mover advantage blow. Google and Microsoft’s response to Apple’s CarPlay will be interesting.•Google, Apple and Microsoft race to bring software to cars
Age:Due to launch in June.Appearance:Initially shiny, then covered in greasy fingerprints.Is this the new iPhone? I've heard Apple is working on a revolutionary design that will last a whole morning without recharging.Sadly not. This is indeed a smartphone, but it comes from a Spanish startup called Geeksphone. It's aimed at users who want increased protection from eavesdroppers and hackers.Drug dealers and terrorists, in other words?Among many others who don't want their credit-card details stolen or their sexts intercepted. According to Geeksphone's CEO, 21-year-old Javier Agüera, "Blackphone is meant for people from all walks of life who are concerned with privacy. It can be normal users from the street, or politicians or whatever."And what will they be able to do with it?Make encrypted phone calls, send encrypted texts and browse the web anonymously, thanks to a partnership with American security company Silent Circle. The Blackphone, which was unveiled at last week's Mobile World Congress, will run a version of Android called PrivatOS, which patches a number of security holes and offers greater control over the information that can be harvested by third-party apps.In English?It will be harder for a game you download, for example, to steal the contents of your address book.What about government spies? Will they still be able to shove their pointy noses where they're not wanted?In theory, yes. The maker admits that the phone will not be NSA-proof. "Bad guys wanting to talk to each other probably shouldn't be using a phone at all,"Blackphone's general manager told the technology blog TechCrunch. That presumably also applies to good guys who would rather keep their confidential conversations confidential.What's the competition?The aerospace companyBoeing is working on its own Android-based smartphonefor government agencies, the military and their contractors. As well as offering encryption, the Boeing Black is designed to self-destruct if anyone attempts to tamper with the hardware.Where can I get one of these?You can pre-order Geeksphone's Blackphone now for $629 (£375), for delivery in June. The Boeing Black will only be available to members of approved organisations.Does that include the Guardian?We've had some fascinating collaborations with the security establishment.Er … Almost certainly not.Do say:"Does it offer end-to-end encryption?"Don't say:"Does it come in white?"
Two weeks ago, the world thought it was at peak Flappy Bird. But oncethe developer pulled it from the Apple and Google app stores, a swathe of versions appeared online, none more notable than flapmmo.com, whichallows users to compete against each other in (almost) real-time.Since the online game launched two weeks ago, the game has not only seen a surge in popularity but has also undergone a number of iterations. Besides adding extra servers, the developers have heightened the graphics by making the user interface more aesthetically pleasing as well as adding statistics to the gameplay.This means users can not only see where fellow gamers are failing (ie they can see where each bird hits an obstacle) but statistics have been introduced underneath each pipe, to show the percentage of "deaths" at each pipe (the stats are reset every two hours). Now, the developers arelooking to launch a mobile app, according to their Twitter account.But after the developers updated the game, one Canadian software developer, Connor Sauve, a former student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, realised the game was now tracking the number of flaps made by each user. Previously, the bird's x and y co-ordinates were sent back to servers every 50ms.For gamers, this means they now see "recordings" of previous attempts by other users rather than the exact movements of those playing at the same time.With that in mind, Sauve left the game open and a local server logged the various attempts made by other users. He ended up logging an incredible 419,000 game attempts, giving him awealth of data to analyse.Here are three of the most interesting trends from the data:1. Some people are just really addictedPhotograph: Connor SauveThis graph is certainly one of the more interesting created by Sauve and compares the number of attempts made during the four-hour period (x axis) against how well they did (y axis).One of the most intriguing points is that one person made nearly 200 attempts and could only stay "alive" for 15 seconds, leaving this gamer to fall into the "zone of colossal failure" (in pink), so dubbed by Sauve for those who ended with fairly dreadful scores when compared with the amount of effort they spent playing the game.While the game might be hard, some might consider it a little odd to not substantially improve after so much practice.It's interesting to note the variation in players too – players who are good at the game ended their gaming sessions fairly early (in the green "zone of skill") whereas those who weren't so good kept trying to beat their previous high scores.2. The further you get, the more difficult it becomesPhotograph: Connor SauveThis graph looks at how successful gamers were, by comparing the number of attempts (y axis) with the number of "flaps" (x axis), which almost always equates to someone getting further in the game.A downward trend is clearly visible through the points, at least up to 100 flaps. After 100 flaps, only 14 people managed to survive, leading to the conclusion that less than two people in every 100,000 can get into treble figures in terms of flaps.This is perhaps a surprise as the game doesn't necessarily get more difficult. Users are faced with the same challenge at every point in the game – get through the pipe – with some suggesting the game gets slightly faster as you go further.It would be more helpful to have more information at this point. For example, were those who got particularly far the same users how only took a few attempts and why did people fail – was it a lapse of concentration or just boredom?3. But don't lose hope, people get better with practicePhotograph: Connor SauveSauve wanted to understand if there was a learning curve in the game, that's to say he wanted to know if people got better if they just kept playing.To create this chart, Sauve only included gamers who had decided to play with nicknames and ignored unnamed participants. It shows the score achieved (y axis) and the number of attempts (x axis). It appears that those who appeared into the green "zone of skill" in the first chart (ie those who performed remarkably in very few attempts) chose not to bother with nicknames as otherwise there would be many more points appearing towards the top-left.
It’s time for this month’s roundup of the best new Android games on the Google Play store. From this month onwards, we’re splitting out apps from games: you can find the link to the separate Best Android Apps roundup at the end of this piece.Prices are correct at the time of writing, and from this month we’re also including a notification when apps that are free to download also use in-app purchases (or IAP, as we’ve marked them).Read on for February’s list, and let us know your recommendations by posting a comment. The equivalent iPhone and iPad roundups will follow later in the day.The Room Two (£1.99)The original The Room was one of the best puzzlers on Android, and its sequel continues the quality. “A physical puzzler, wrapped in a mystery game, inside a beautifully tactile 3D world,” as its developer puts it, this is beautifully-crafted 3D puzzling posing a considerable challenge to your logic skills.Final Fantasy VI (£10.99)The latest of Square Enix’s vintage RPG games to hit Google Play is a pixel-perfect port of the 1994 iteration of Final Fantasy, with additional features from a 2006 remake. If you like Final Fantasy games, this is a great blast of nostalgia, but if you’re new to the series, it might just be the ideal introduction to the series.Amateur Surgeon 3 (Free + IAP)Adult Swim’s Amateur Surgeon games have been great fun, and this third instalment continues the vein of gory humour. It sees you performing surgery on a range of strange characters using, well, a range of unlikely-to-be-recommended-in-hospitals instruments, from pizza cutters to car batteries. It’s very fun.HonorBound (Free + IAP)This is the latest mobile game that I’ve disappeared down a rabbit-hole with: a polished and inventive RPG where you build a party of heroes, explore a succession of levels, and capture monsters along the way who might just become your next playable heroes. Entertaining RPG action with a dash of Pokemon-style collecting.Shadow Blade (Free + IAP)The latest from Crescent Moon Games, this is a very neatly-done ninja-themed platform game, as you dive, jump and sneak through levels offing a bunch of enemies. This genre doesn’t always work well on touchscreens, so it’s to the developer’s credit that this example leaps those pitfalls to provide a smooth experience.Card Wars - Adventure Time (£2.39 + IAP)Adventure Time is supposed to be a children’s TV show, but I suspect I’m enjoying its gaming-infused charms as much as my kids. This official release takes a card-battling game from the show and turns it into an Android game, as you build a deck of characters and spells then battle favourites from the show.Music Inc (Free)This is a game from British music industry body UK Music, working with Aardman on a game to give players an insight into what it might take to make musical stars. You run a label signing artists, recording songs, planning tours and keeping an eye on piracy figures (the latter is part of the game’s awareness-building mission). It’s good fun.Dandelions Chain of Seeds (£1.80 + IAP)This excellent indie title comes highly recommended, having recently won a Critic’s Choice prize at the Casual Connect Europe conference. It’s an “ambient” puzzler where you connect up dandelion seeds across 60 puzzles. It’s a decidedly unstressful experience, with plenty of replayability.Ridge Racer Slipstream (Free + IAP)Namco Bandai’s Ridge Racer gets its latest mobile outing, although this may be controversial with some fans due to its use of timers to slow down the gameplay for non-payers. The actual game is impressive enough: speedy and smooth with lots of vehicle customisation. Play it yourself to see what you make of the timers though.Card City Nights (£1.49)This is unusual: a game in a genre (card battling) that’s almost always freemium, but which uses no in-app purchases at all. More importantly, it’s really good: a mix of adventure-style storytelling and card battles, with 180 cards to collect as you play. The combo system, where you connect cards up, is a nice twist on similar games too.Swordigo (Free)Another marvellous platformer that previously made its Android debut as part of the Humble Bundle series. Released alone as a free title, it’s an enticing mix of monster-slicing and exploration. The developers say they may add in-app purchases and/or ads in the future, but for now it’s entirely free, and well worth snapping up.Pathogen - Strategy Board Game (£1.82)More zen-based puzzling here, with this turn-based strategy game that can be played alone in a single-player campaign, or against up to three other players locally or online. Based on human viruses, it sees you placing cells to take over the board, and with a lot of depth once you get into the nitty-gritty of viral strategy.Play to Cure: Genes In Space (Free)Another interesting source for a mobile game: charity Cancer Research UK, which commissioned this space-themed game, which gets players to collect “Element Alpha” by exploring the universe. The twist is that by playing, your smartphone is analysing real genetic data and feeding it back to researchers at the charity.Intern Saga: Trademark Lawyer (Free)There’s been a lot of unrest online at the news that developer King was filing trademarks based on its Candy Crush Saga game. Intern Saga is one of the more inventive protests: a game where you play as an intern for a trademark lawyer, filing takedowns from an app store. It makes its point well, but is also a decent game in its own right.Deadman’s Cross (Free + IAP)Another game from Square Enix, and another card-battler, although this one is more characteristic of the genre with its use of in-app purchases. Developed by a number of veterans from the Final Fantasy games, it sees you building a zombie horde to battle against other undead armies, complete with Walking Dead-style post-apocalyptic setting.Call of Mini Dino Hunter (Free + IAP)Cutesy first-person shooter Call of Mini gets a dinosaur-themed offshoot, as you blast your way through dinos across 50 quests, upgrading your character along the way with skills and items. It’s the latter where the real fun of the game lies, as you build a character suited to your preferred method of playing.Brandnew Boy (£2.22 + IAP)There are lots of action RPGs available for Android, so new releases need something different to stand out. Brandnew Boy has that, tapping the Unreal Engine 3 for its impressive graphics – complete with hand-drawn feel – with constant battles and a very well-designed controls system providing a challenge in all the right ways.Colin McRae Rally (£2.99)A famous name from the console games world comes to Android courtesy of publisher Thumbstar Games, as you slip’n’slide your way round a succession of rally tracks and pit your driving wits over rallies and full championships. It nails the handling – crucial for this sub-genre of racing – and looks good too.Mystery of the Opera (Free + IAP)Publisher G5 is finding a fertile cross between hidden-object and adventure games, with Mystery of the Opera its latest example – clearly influenced by a certain theatrical Phantom. You have to solve a mystery by finding objects in 60 scenes, while also interrogating characters and playing mini-games.Endless Boss Fight (Free + IAP)Finally this week, a very neat twist on the beat ‘em up genre where you fight one boss, who keeps evolving as you play. That means you have to constantly upgrade your own character too, with the chance to battle against other players’ bosses as you improve. It’s colourful and frenetic, with good scope for strategic skills.Now read:20 best Android apps of February 2014
It’s time for this month’s roundup of the best new Android apps on the Google Play store. From this month onwards, we’re splitting out apps from games: you can find the link to the separate Best Android Games roundup at the end of this piece.Prices are correct at the time of writing, and from this month we’re also including a notification when apps that are free to download also use in-app purchases (or IAP, as we’ve marked them).Read on for February’s list, and let us know your recommendations by posting a comment.PolyFauna (Free)This is an official app from Radiohead, based on the song ‘Bloom’ from their ‘King of Limbs’ album. Described as “an experimental collaboration” with studio Universal Everything, it’s an eerie interactive experience as you explore virtual landscapes. Interesting and innovative, albeit one for fans.Opera Max beta for Android (Free)New from browser-maker Opera, this is an app that aims to help you save on your data usage – potentially invaluable if you travel overseas a lot and thus get regularly whacked by roaming fees. The app aims to compress data used by “almost every” app on your smartphone, not just the browser.Me Books (Free + IAP)Me Books is an app for buying and reading digital children’s picture books, including those based on brands like Peter Rabbit, Peppa Pig and Charlie and Lola. The books, which mostly cost £1.99 each, offer voice narration and the ability to record your own dialogue and sound effects – good news for budding Daddy Pigs everywhere.Toca Lab (£1.99)Another impressive children’s app for Android, this is the latest release from Toca Boca. It has a scientific focus, as kids explore the periodic table by spinning, heating, cooling and mixing up the elements – as represented by cute characters. It’s a playful and creative introduction to the science that kids will meet later on in their academic careers.Google Now Launcher (Free)For Nexus or Google Play edition Android devices only, this is an upgrade to the native Android launcher application, making the company’s Google Now software easier to access by swiping right from the main homescreen. You can also use the “Ok Google” voice command to trigger apps and commands when on your homescreen.Basecamp - Official App (Free)If you spend a lot of time managing complex business projects, chances are you’ve encountered the Basecamp service. Now it has an official Android app, helping you keep tabs on projects from your mobile device, including accessing documents and posting comments to team discussions.Fairshare (Free)If you live in a shared house and experience the odd… difficulty, Fairshare may be an essential download. Developed in Australia and now going global, it aims to help you set who does what chore, divide up bills and plan dinners and other joint activities. A happier household will (hopefully) be the result.Snap Fashion (Free)This is potentially very useful for fashionistas: an app that you can use to take a photo of a garment you like, and find similar items on a range of stores. Partners include Topshop, French Connection, New Look and Net-a-Porter, with the results based on the cut and colour of clothing – meaning you should find some good matches.Episode - Choose Your Story (Free + IAP)This is an intriguing idea, sitting somewhere between games and traditional fiction, it’s billed as a “home for interactive, visual stories” – a new spin on Choose Your Own Adventure tales with visuals reminiscent of social mobile games. Romance, detective fiction and other genres are included.Tidy - Photo Album (Free)There are plenty of apps for sharing photos, but not so many that do a good job of helping you organise the thousands of snaps you’ve already taken. Tidy is hoping to do that: it groups pics by time, place and “shapes”, then helps you navigate around them. It can also do the sharing thing though, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.TimePIN (Free + IAP)This is a simple, but rather impressive idea: an app that sets your lockscreen PIN as the current time or date, meaning it’s constantly changing, yet easy for you to remember. You can use it for free, but some additional features are unlocked using an in-app purchase.SKIT! Animated Video Maker (Free)A fun social app, this, turning photos into animated “cards” that can be sent to friends and family. It draws on photos stored on your device or previously uploaded to Facebook, and can share the resulting video-slideshows to YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, as well as sending them via email.Auto Finder (Free + IAP)I remember the early days of Apple’s App Store, when “find your car after you’ve parked it” apps were popular. The genre hasn’t gone away: Auto Finder is the latest app aiming to help you get back to your motor, with the schtick here being its ability to mark your car’s location automatically, rather than you having to do it.Togethera: Share Family Photos (Free)More photo-sharing, but this time restricted to your closest contacts. Togethera is aimed at families – extended, so grandparents, aunts and uncles etc too – who want to share photos, videos and other updates. You set up the groups as you see fit, and the service runs across smartphones, tablets and computers.Depop (Free)Depop is the latest shopping app for Android – an alternative to eBay in its ability to help you buy, but also sell. The latter is slickly handled, as you take a photo then create a listing for a device, then share the link to it on various social networks. For buyers, there are neatly-organised categories and item-following features.Zwallet (Free)While we’re on a shopping tip, Zwallet is a new take on the idea of a mobile wallet, taking in payments, loyalty schemes and discount vouchers. The company behind it is British, so the retail partners are suitable for the UK: Ask, B&amp;Q, The Body Shop, Zizzi and more are all working with the app already.Samsung Power Sleep (Free)Billed as “the first alarm clock to do good deeds”, this is a new app from Samsung whose twist is that while you sleep, it decrypts protein sequences for the University of Vienna, sending them the results when it wakes you up. A good idea, although it does rely on you connecting your device to a charger overnight.Dormi - Baby Monitor (Free + IAP)Why buy a brand new baby monitor when an older Android device might fit the bill? This app connects Android devices enabling one to be used as a child monitor, alerting the parent when their child cries out. You get four free hours of monitoring a month in the initial download, but can pay for unlimited use via in-app purchase.Kicksend: Share &amp; Print Photos (Free)This is most useful in the US, where the ability to get photos printed and delivered either to your home or a nearby retailer works.

HMRC plans to stop charging VAT on bitcoin trading, abandoning an earlier decision to treat the virtual currency as a “voucher” subject to sales tax.The briefing provides newly clarified ruleson the tax liabilities for both individuals and businesses handling cryptocurrencies including, but not limited to, bitcoin.“This briefing gives much-needed clarity to digital currency businesses, many of whom had been looking to move offshore,” says Tom Robinson, the founder of bitcoin traderEllipticand director of the newly formed UK digital currency association (UKDCA), which aims to represent the British cryptocurrency community.“The UKDCA looks forward to working with financial regulators to further clarify the legal status of digital currencies and ensure that the UK takes the lead in developing this highly innovative technology,” Robinson added.The briefing steers clear of explicitly declaring bitcoin a currency, but the rules laid out are “almost identical” to how conventional currencies are treated, according to the UKDCA. Crucially, not only is the purchase of the currency no longer subject to VAT, neither are the margins miners make if they sell their newly produced coins.However, HMRC insists that profits made by bitcoin traders and miners are still liable for corporation tax, income tax, and capital gains tax.GoxBuxHMRC’s decision comes amid the continued fallout of the collapse of MtGox, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange.A group of concerned former customers, led by tech entrepreneur Josh Weinstein, have banded together to “gather information, compare notes, and explore legal options and remedies”. Calling themselvesGoxBux, the 23 members claim to have lost a combined total of $79,150 and 2763.302 BTC, worth more than £1.5m or £70,000 per person.The losses have led some US legislators to call for a total ban on the currency. Senator Joe Manchin said,in an open letter to Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen, that he was concerned that “as bitcoin is inevitably banned in other countries, Americans will be left holding the bag on a valueless currency.”On Friday, Yellen declared that the US Fed does not have the authority to regulate bitcoin, at least while it continues to be largely separate from the mainstream banking system.•US prosecutors investigate businesses dealing in bitcoins•Updated 18:01 with the newly released briefing.
Square Enix; PC, PS3, PS4 (version tested), Xbox 360, Xbox One; from £30; Cert 18The loading screens in Thief are very beautiful. Every time the player dies, restarts a checkpoint or travels between hub areas in the game, they're greeted with concept art of the world the game's titular hero, Garrett, inhabits, depicting scenes and structures that are as intricate as they are haunting.They'll see a dust-covered factory, its shattered windows glowing, its chimney belching soot over its roof. They'll see a crumbling cathedral with spires pointing accusingly up at a sickly green sky as a flock of birds are silhouetted by the few rays managing to poke through the gloom. My own personal favourite is a picture of the interior of a brothel called The House Of Blossoms; in it the velvet cushions and curtains seem like blood-red beacons in the shadows, lending the seedy activities on display a touch of class.The reason I mention Thief's loading screens, though, isn't just because they're stunning. It's because players see an awful lot of them. Thief's loading times are rather length and, whatever you may have heard about Thief, know this: it makes few concessions to players who prefer the direct approach. As in any stealth game, trial and error is an integral part of Thief.Garrett may move with preternatural agility but in a stand-up fight against more than one opponent, he doesn't last long. It's also hard to gauge his surroundings in some environments and emerging from the shadows risks him being spotted and an alarm being raised.The fact that Garrett can only interact with certain parts of his environment also presents problems. Time and time again, players will break cover and head towards what looks like a climbable object, only to have Garrett leap up and down impotently in front of it. If there are guards about, they make short work of him and then you're back in front of a loading screen.So the fact that the reloading times in the game are fairly long is slightly problematic. It's true in that in stealth games patience isn't so much a virtue as it is a requirement, but most players expect to be shoved back into the action as soon as possible regardless of the type of game they're playing. Well, at least you'll have some nice vistas to look at.This is true of the rest of the game, too. Whatever other faults it has, visually speaking, Thief is sublime. In fact, other than Ryse on the Xbox One, I can think of no other title released yet that matches it in terms of being a showcase for next generation graphics.Eidos Montreal has created a world that is as detailed as it is chock full of a sense of foreboding. The city the player traverses is a rats' maze of cobbled streets and rain-slicked alleys surrounded by cracked stone mansions and rickety wooden buildings. The city of Thief is an amalgamation of Victorian and Gothic architecture, a place where the rise of Steampunk technology and a debilitating plague feel positively natural as bedfellows.The visuals go a long way towards selling the player on some of the events that occur in Thief, which is good, because the game's narrative is pretty poor. After a botched burglary attempt, Garrett is knocked out for a full year. Upon awakening he finds his city overrun with a plague called the Gloom and a dictator named Baron Northcrest seems to have launched a work program similar to Stalin's Five Year Plan. Garrett is introduced to Orion, the leader of a clandestine resistance movement, by his old friend and fence, Basso, and embarks on a series of burglaries that may have far-reaching implications for the city and its inhabitants.While the narrative sounds quite straightforward, it feels very disjointed in its execution. For example, the 365-day hibernation Garrett enjoys isn't registered until an hour-and-a half after the game's opening, so by the time this information tidbit surfaces it sounds rather ludicrous. Furthermore, Garrett himself seems rather unaffected or even surprised by the idea he may have slipped into a year-long coma. Occasionally he'll make reference to how terrible things are, but his tone and delivery don't really convey the sense the city was any worse off than when he left it – and neither does the environment in which the  tutorial takes place, which occurs chronologically before he was knocked out.There's also an unhealthy amount of reliance on dream sequences and Garrett blacking out to move the plot forward. Every single time the narrative paints him into a corner, Garrett either loses consciousness or players find themselves having to navigate a darkened environment filled with luminous plants. Given the paucity of plot development and the clichéd atmosphere in these scenarios, they feel both cheap and thin.To be frank, Thief only comes into its own when players are able to ignore the concerns of the plot entirely. Once Garrett is tasked with tracking down some trinket – whether in the Chapter mission or by one of the numerous NPCs offering clandestine work – Thief really starts to come alive.There's a wonderfully delicate grace to Garrett, which makes itself felt through the game's visuals; the way Garrett's hands skim around the side of a painting, looking for a hidden catch or the deftness of his touch with a lockpick are two lovely examples of this. The smooth elegance with which he moves even sells players on the game's 'swoop' mechanic, a swift duck-and-dodge movement that allows Garrett to move quickly through pools of light.Garrett also has a Focus ability, which, when activated, bathes everything darkness while highlighting enemies, trinkets and parts of the environment that Garrett can interact with. There's a also a light meter in the bottom left hand corner of the HUD, which tells the player whether or not Garrett is safely concealed in the shadows.A lot of the player's time in Thief is spent collecting shiny trinkets. Coins, ink-wells, candelabras, cups, syringes and more are all lying around the game's environments and some of them pop up in the strangest places; sure, you'd expect to find a letter opener in a desk drawer, but what's a golden goblet doing on the roof of a slum dwelling?Most trinkets convert to cash instantly, but there's also a selection of collectible treasures, which appear in Garrett's clock tower once they've been snagged. Most of these are concealed in safes or locked chests both in areas of the game's hub and Chapter missions.Players spend Garrett's cash on upgrades and equipment; they can buy weapon upgrades, armour, trick arrows and the tools of Garrett's trade from a bloke at the pub Basso operates out of. They can purchase Focus points from the Queen Of Beggars, which allow them to level up Garrett's innate abilities like his dexterity, lockpicking speed and the lightness of his footfalls.While these abilities give Garrett an edge, they don't turn any missions into a straight turkey shoot. The developers clearly have one eye on the franchise's core fan base. The game's biggest problem, then, is its constricting structure. While the city hub is presented as a wide open sandbox, it is in actual fact a series of environments separated by a bunch of loading screens. The destinations Garrett heads to in the Chapter missions are essentially wide corridors and while there are multitude of routes and hidden pathways through them, and they accommodate player improvisation to a degree, they aren't the open-ended puzzle boxes of the past.Of course, it's up to each player to decide whether any of the aforementioned drawbacks are deal-breakers. Thief feels unwieldy at times, although it's not the travesty some reviewers are making it out to be. It's a beautiful stealth game that's fun to play in bursts, but it's hard to recommend it without reservations. No one ever said being a criminal was easy…
Tengami is a beautiful, fragile thing. It's a haiku, in game form: simple, stylish, complete in and of itself, trying to give you a full experience condensed into a few syllables. And, like a haiku, it doesn't always manage to fulfil its ambitions.Tengami takes place in a papercraft world, akin to a pop-up book. It's painstakingly and intricately constructed so that each structure in the game could be recreated in the real world with paper, scissors and glue. Its best moments come when it plays that conceit: folding the world into new configurations to reveal abandoned buildings, temples, new winding pathways up mountains for you to follow. The folding comes with a gorgeous scratchy paper noise that makes Tengami feel almost physical under your fingers.A beautiful worldThe game is visually gorgeous and acoustically atmospheric, and its world is beautifully designed. The central character, an unnamed hero, must travel through a desolate and ruined landscape, to recover three flowers which have fallen from a tree. He walks with deliberate purpose through seasons denoted by duo-tone colour schemes that wash the game with bright colour. Every frame from Tengami could be screenshotted, printed at high resolution and hung on a wall in a gallery; it is some of the most artistically elegant and subtle work I have ever seen.But. But. I don't want to dislike Tengami, because it is so beautiful to look at and to listen to, because it is crafted with so much delicacy and love, and because it ought to be so restful to play. But. It suffers from some of the same constraints as a real pop-up book: the interactions are generally obvious and limited in scope. I find myself sighing with mild disappointment at the third instance of the same puzzle mechanic. I find myself double tapping on the screen to walk through a (beautiful, but minimal) area for the third time and then having to stop myself from playing Threes on my phone while the walking animation plays. When I realise I must solve a code that is going to involve a significant amount of backtracking, I decide to go do something else for a while.Dead calmThere's a specific mood that Tengami is trying to create in its players, I suspect, and it's not one I'm good at sustaining. It's trying for a calm, meditative state, a variation on a Saturday morning sort of "lying on the sofa with a cup of tea not doing anything very much" feeling. As the game begins, I can feel my breathing slow and my world narrow into this calm little measured space, the character's deliberate steps, the sounds and the gorgeous colours of the game helping to pull me in. But after a while, the deliberate steps start to feel slow. The minimalist environments start to feel sparse and unpopulated. The calm stillness begins to feel dull.I don't think everyone will feel this way about Tengami, at all. I can see it as a meditative experience, in which the puzzles are rewarding tests of patience and mindfulness for the player. I can understand it as a slow game played to relax, a complete thing to be enjoyed and absorbed the same way you might watch a film on a weekend. But I wanted more: more depth, more interaction, more complexity; a hero's journey with more at stake than flowers.
Rockstar Games, the creator of the Grand Theft Auto series, is to be awarded with a Bafta Fellowship. The accolade celebrates outstanding artistic achievement in movies, television and video games.The company’s founders Sam and Dan Houser, along with Grand Theft Auto developers Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut, will accept the honour at the Bafta video game awards, taking place in London on 12 March.Grand Theft Auto is one of the biggest entertainment franchises in the world. The most recent instalment, GTA V, has sold over 32m copies since its launch in September, earning $1bn in revenue in the space of just three days, out-performing the biggest movie releases. The entire series, which began in 1997, has sold over 250m copies.Although controversial for their mature, often extremely violent content, the Grand Theft Auto titles are critically revered for their sheer scope and design ambition. Set in a fictionalised version of the United States, each game follows a selection of gangsters and hoodlums as they rise through the criminal ranks, attempting ever more ambitious heists. The open-world nature of the environments means players are free to do what they please between missions, stealing cars, setting up their own businesses and even playing the stock exchange. Filled with damaged, ruthless characters including corrupt politicians, aspiring actors and shadowy government agencies, the titles are often seen as satires on modern Western Society.“We have long believed in the potential for videogames to become a new form of cultural expression and worked to show that in our games, so for us accepting the BAFTA Fellowship is incredibly humbling,” said Sam Houser, who founded Rockstar Games in 1998. “This honour reflects the creative vision and dedication of a huge number of people over many years, and we look forward to accepting the Fellowship on their behalf.”Previous recipients of the video game fellowship include Will Wright, the creator of Sim City and The Sims, and Shigeru Miyamoto, the designer of the Super Mario and Zelda games. The accolade will be presented as part of a refreshed British Academy Games Awards ceremony, which will be open to the public for the first time, and includes a showcase where many of the nominated titles will be playable.•GTA 5 review: a dazzling but monstrous parody of modern life•Grand Theft Auto 5 – inside the creative process with Dan Houser•The making of Grand Theft Auto: ‘Like nailing jelly to kittens’ - video
Apple has rebranded its iOS in the Car initiative as CarPlay, and unveiled Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo as the first partners to build it into their vehicles.Originallyannounced at Apple’s WWDC conference in 2013, iOS in the Car aimed to connect iPhones into in-car information and entertainment systems.The rebranding was announced this morning at the Geneva International Motor Show, making it clear that CarPlay is the in-car equivalent to Apple’s AirPlay technology in the living room.Apple’s Siri virtual assistant technology is key to the initiative, acting as the interface for drivers to access their contacts, make calls and listen to voicemails, while also reading out messages and responding to voice commands.Apple’s Maps service will be a key feature in CarPlay too, with routes shown on the car’s own screen, and spoken turn-by-turn directions. Digital music is also part of CarPlay, but it is not an iTunes-only affair, with Spotify and US service iHeartRadio among the third-party apps that will work with it.Apple stressed that it had safety in mind when designing CarPlay. “iPhone users always want their content at their fingertips and CarPlay lets drivers use their iPhone in the car with minimised distraction,” said vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing Greg Joswiak.Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo will be showing off their first CarPlay cars this week. All three were included ona slide shown at WWDC of partners for iOS in the Car, so have been working with Apple for some time on in-car technology.The company said today it also has deals with 13 more manufacturers to integrate CarPlay in the future: BMW Group, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai Motor Company, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia Motors, Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan Motor Company, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota Motor Corp.Here, as in other areas of its business, Apple is engaged in fierce competition with Google, whichlaunched an initiative called the Open Automotive Alliancein January at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. Based on its Android operating system, its founding partners included GM, Honda, Audi and Hyundai.•Google, Apple and Microsoft race to bring software to cars
A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamRiver level data must be open &gt;&gt; Climate Code FoundationNick Barnes has seen his home flooded for the second time in a month:There are thousands of river monitoring stations across the UK, recording water levels every few minutes. The [Environment] Agency publishes the resulting data on its website, in pages likethis. For each station it shows a graph of the level over the last 24 hours (actually, the 24 hours up to the last reported data: my local station stopped reporting three days ago, presumably overwhelmed by the water), and has some running text giving the current level in metres above a local datum. There's a small amount of station metadata, and that's all. No older data, and no tabular data.

I really hate it. It overwhelms the copy text, which is usually reduced to a dull, grey little stream trickling its way through enormous glaring billboard-like pages all of which are clamoring to draw your attention to stuff you don't want; and the first thing you have to do when you buy a new magazine is shake it over a bin in order to shed all the coupons, sachets, packets, CDs and free labrador puppies which make them as fat an unwieldy as a grandmother's scrapbook. And then, when you are interested in buying something, you can't find any information about it because it was in last month's issue which you've now thrown away. I bought a new camera last month, and bought loads of camera magazines just to find ads and reviews for the models I was interested in. So I resent about 99% of the advertising I see, but occasionally I want it enough to actually buy the stuff. There's a major mismatch - something is ripe to fall out of the model.Of course, he was right.

We spent a bit of time talking to consumers all over the world to get a handle on what the primary tasks they did with their PC the most of the time. What I discovered was enlightening. The vast majority of consumers we spoke to (greater than 90%) rarely used more than a handful of applications.Mostly they just browsed the web, used an email client, played some casual games (like Solitaire), and every now and then Word or Excel. My key takeaway was that the vast majority of time consumers spent using their PCs they were doing very simple things.

Endicott is a small town – a village, really – outside Binghamton, New York. It used to swarm with the energy of IBM employees. IBM put Endicott on the map. The tech giant had its first headquarters there in 1906, and the site is still called “Plant No 1” in company lore, commemorated with a nine-pagechronology and photo album on IBM’s website. Endicott was the center of IBM innovation, playing home to annual conventions of engineers and experts in “tent cities“. At its height, the town – of around13,000people – counted11,000 IBM employeesin 16 office buildings.Now most of those buildings are filled by the employees of other companies. According to an employee group known as theAlliance@IBM, Big Blue hasonly 720 employees leftin Endicott, all in one building.IBM lost a few more employees there last week, with a giant round of jobs cuts that swept through Endicott and other small towns where the computer powerhouse has a disproportionate effect on local economies:Essex Junction, Vermont;Rochester, Minnesota;Dubuque, Iowa;Poughkeepsie, New York; Tulsa, Oklahoma;Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; andColumbia, Missouri.The target of employees’ ire is not just IBM; it’s the deal with the devil that they think IBM has struck with Wall Street. The less formal name for the Faustian contract is the2015 roadmap, as it is known around IBM. Its premise is simple: IBM wants to deliver $20 earnings per share to its stockholders by 2015. That’s not exactly an easy task considering that right now,IBM’s EPS is $14.94per share. As the company draws near its self-imposed deadline, investors seem to be skeptical, pushing its stock price down. IBM stockcurrently trades at $185, down 15% from its highest point in the past year.The upshot is that IBM has put itself on the hook and it can’t get off. Launched byformer CEO Sam Palmisano in 2010,the $20EPS-by-2015 plan has done more in the past few years to determine IBM’s financial path than almost anything else. Many employees believe that the success of IBM’s new CEO, Ginny Rometty, will hinge onwhether she delivers the right numbers to Wall Street by next year.Employees looking for evidence that the company favors Wall Street rather than their well-being find evidence everywhere. The company, infamously zip-lipped about layoffs, only warned workers obliquely last year when making a public announcement to investors. IBM promised shareholders that the company would spend $1bn cutting an unnamed number of jobs, which analystToni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Researchput at 13,000 layoffs.Rometty’s mandate includes impressing Wall Street with IBM’s efficiency – which, in the patois of finance, often means “layoffs”. And it’s not just IBM. The phenomenon is often called “the cult of shareholder value”, and the debate centers on whether America’s biggest companies are focusing too much on increasing their stock prices for flash, and too little on long-term innovation and the happiness of other stakeholders – including their own employees.IBM has a crop of outspoken workers. The company, despite its400,000 employees worldwide, is something of a small town itself, the kind with employees who only expect to hear about layoffs through the electronic watercooler: the much-visited message board of Alliance@IBM, a group of300 members and 5,000 supportersthat considers itself a kind of union for IBM employees. (It tags itself as CWA Local 1701).Lee Conrad, the organization’s leader, tells me Alliance heard “inside info” in January that the cuts were coming, and started spreading the word through its network.“IBM likes to tell people ‘we have no union,’” Conrad says. “They don’t want to admit we even exist. But our members have union cards in their wallet and they work at IBM.”Alliance plays a key role for the little guy at Big Blue, helping laid-off employees get their bearings – but its crown jewel is the online forums labeled under “Job Cuts Reports”. With snappy rants and frequent visitors, it lights up as a searing source of gossip when layoffs take place. Conrad, for instance, collected information that suggested the job cuts appeared to be based in two areas: business services and systems technology.This week, as employees in Endicott and other towns were losing their jobs, the Alliance@IBM website crashed from the number of people trying to read it.And the comments, sharp as always, did not disappoint for anyone looking to vent about IBM. One user, in a post titled “HapplyReleased”, spoke for many:Everyone knows their time will come, they just don’t know when. Employees are haunted with the prospect of redundancy.To Conrad, a former IBMer who fields employee complaints, the 2015 roadmap and Wall Street-as-nemesis consistently come up as themes when IBM workers are unhappy. “Employees are saying this business model benefits stockholders and executives is hurting the business,” he says. “It’s not building the business, it’s chasing the money. … People are running on a myth of the old IBM that cared about employees, that cares about the business, the executives in charge here. It’s all about getting that $20 per share.”Employees in the US, and in those small towns, also say they’re unhappy that IBM is shrinking in America while outsourcing to countries like India. “We want people to know that the IBM US population has been shrinking dramatically for the past few years,” says Conrad. “It used to be 160,000, 10 years ago, and now it’s 88,000 and declining.”IBM doesn’t break out the numbers publicly, butin a statementthe company said, “At any given time, IBM has more than 3,000 job openings in … growth areas in the US. IBM’s total workforce has remained stable over the past three years.” IBM also pushed back against the idea that the company is shrinking, pointing out that itcommitted $1bn to its new Watson unitand $2.2bn to expand its cloud offerings, as well as “investments in areas such as nanotechnology which will bring hundreds of new jobs to New York State”.None of which seems to cut it for the employees who are let go, and there are thousands of them – although no one knows exactly how many, since IBM no longer discloses the number of layoffs in a unit, even to employees.And so the residents of Endicott, New York – and IBM’s other small company towns – are stuck with the message boards to figure it all out.
For several dozen entries during its long history theCastlevaniaseries has charged players with pursuing and vanquishing Dracula. And, over 27 years,Castlevania's protagonists, the Belmont family, shone at the task in 2D but floundered when they came to hunt their vampire prey in the third dimension.With 2010'sLords of Shadow, however,Castlevaniaseemed to have found its 3D footing, delivering an elegant game-world that weightedLords of Shadow 2with both promise and expectation. Not only was the formula to be refined and reworked but it was also to offer, for the first time in the series, the chance for players to assume the role of Dracula.Unsurprisingly, then,Lords of Shadow 2is a macabre hack'n'slash adventure, where frenetic melee combat and platforming dominate the gameplay – as with its predecessor. But this time around the game flits between Dracula's gothic castle in the past, and a near-future metropolis built on its ruins, presenting a world more open than 2010's linear-leaning effort.Sadly, uninspired level design, awkward stealth sections and monotonous missions mean Dracula's playable debut underwhelms. With time the game improves, and the combat – balanced, demanding and dramatic – is enjoyable, while elsewhere it does have its moments, but on this form it seems Drac himself might have been better treating the spotlight as he might the cursed sunlight.
As tablets and mobiles grow in power, so too has the temptation to port console games on to smaller screens, whether it be old-school classics such asSonic 2(Sega, iOS, £1.99) or the more complex fare ofGTA: San Andreas(Rockstar, iOS, £4.99), with its impossibly large open world. But these games are inevitably hampered by touchscreen controls, hence Apple's decision to include controller support in iOS7 and the recent arrival of MFi (made for iPod) peripherals to ape their living room-bound counterparts.Sonic &amp; All Stars Racing: Transformed(Sega, iOS, £2.99) offers Mario Kart-style racing with Sega's cartoony characters. But despite polished gameplay, and the addition of planes and boats, the tilt-and-touch controls can be awkward. It really comes into its own, however, when playing with a proper controller.The SteelSeries Stratus (£67.90) is the pick of the bunch. It fits in a pocket, but is not too cramped as to be unusable, and doesn't suffer from the unresponsiveness that plagues some of the "clip-on" models (which attach to an iPhone). The size is a drawback – as is the difficulty of propping up your phone (it is much better suited for use with an iPad), but it does offer the promise of proper console-style gaming on an iDevice.
A game based on a film based on a series of games based on successful cinematic twists to a much-loved toy. It certainly doesn't sound like a good basis for a quality product – but as with&nbsp;TheLego Movie, its gaming spin-off manages to sidestep the obvious pitfalls to provide a slice of building-block fun that will, remarkably, appeal to fans of the toy, film and past games alike.Taking its lead from the games upon which the tenor of the film was based, the gameplay is a now familiar 3D platform-puzzler with a Lego twist. Blocks are manipulated to solve the tasks and a variety of characters have different skills enabling new areas of the world to be explored, with the likes of Batman featuring alongside the film's everyman hero Emmet as he seeks the Piece of Resistance. The plot sticks firmly to the movie, providing whopping spoilers for anyone yet to make the trip to the cinema.The game does lack some of the appeal of its predecessors – this is no tongue-in-cheek look at the source material as has come to be expected – but if it can't quite live up to the film's soon-to-be ubiquitous "Everything isawesome!" catchphrase, it still easily surpasses the usual movie cash-ins.
If you were hoping to find a hotel room in Barcelona last week, then tough luck. Barcelona was full, period. It was the week of theMobile World Congress, you see, the annual convention of what is, for the moment at least, the most dynamic industry on the planet. Everybody and his dog was there, except of course Apple, which sees no need to play second fiddle even to a global conference when it can attract more media attention with its own events.Leave aside the fact that it was Apple that triggered the most recent explosion in the mobile industry – the smartphone revolution – and ponder what was actually on show in Barcelona. The answer, inthe words of one astute and unsentimental observer, Professor Barry Avery, was: "Many phones, little innovation." (Shades of Yeats's pithy description of his – and my – native land: "Great hatred, little room.")"The message coming out of this year's event," wrote Avery, "is that while there are lots of new phones coming, we shouldn't expect a great technological leap from any of them. Most of the phones are incremental updates, running the latest version of Android's mobile phone operating systemKitKat."Avery is too polite. The truth is that the mobile phone industry has run out of ideas. Every single smartphone in the market is basically just a variation on the Apple iPhone theme. And the variations, such as they are, are looking increasingly – and desperately – baroque: bigger or sharper screens, better cameras with more megapixels and xenon flash, louder speakers, more sensitive accelerometers and microphones, maps and navigation, fingerprint access control, etc, etc. What we're into, in other words, is the "feature bloat" that was once a distinguishing characteristic of Microsoft Office software. And the only new idea the mobile industry currently seems to have is that of wirelessly hooking up the phone in your pocket with a wearable device, whether it's a wristwatch, a wristband, a pair of geeky glasses or (in due course) a sensor connected to the more intimate parts of the user's body.The richest irony of all is that the purveyors of increasingly baroque "smartphones" have devised a contemptuous term for those mobile phones that only make voice calls and send SMS messages. They are called feature phones, if you please.I have a good friend who runs an exceedingly busy life using one of these despised devices. It's so small that she often has hunt for it in handbag or rucksack. It has a battery life of nearly a week, even with intensive use. It has a predictive text algorithm that sometimes produces the kind ofunintended consequencescelebrated in innumerable websites. (My favourite is the one where, in response to the message, "Dude, where are you?", a chap replied, "Sorry bro caught up here with my mom. She asked me to help her sell her vagina on Craigslist. So I'm photographing it and stuff." What he thought he had typed was "china".)Cheap and cheerful: the Nokia 220. Photograph: Toni Albir/EPAOf course my friend also uses email – but only at the beginning and end of the day. As a result, she is much more in control of her communications – and freed from the intrinsic distractions that mobile email and internet access offer to the rest of us. And she doesn't have to worry about running out of charge even at the end of a long working day.What's happened to smartphones is really just par for the technological course. These things follow asigmoid– ie S-shaped – curve. Development starts relatively slowly, then picks up rapidly until about 80% of the potential of the technology has been realised, after which the rate of innovation slows down and we're into the period of incremental change and the baroque encrustation with dubious "features" that characterised this year's Mobile World Congress.For that reason, the most interesting device to emerge from the congress was not a smartphone or a wearable gizmo, but a simple, down-to-earth, cheap phone made by – you guessed it! – Nokia, the troubled technology giant currently in the process of being gobbled up my Microsoft.The Nokia 220comes in a range of bright colours, has a simple camera (2 megapixels), a simple browser that uses data compression, comes with access to Twitter and Facebook baked in (but doesn't do 3G or 4G connections) and can handle dual SIM cards. It has a quoted standby time of between 24 and 29 days (depending on whether you have a dual-SIM model or not). Oh, and it will cost just 29 euros, which is about £24 in real money. It goes on sale next week. The journey back to the future starts then.
So what isthe Hour of Code?Avid Larizadeh,co-founder of accessories design firm Boticca.com and head of the Hour of Code UK campaignThe Hour of Code is an attempt to teach people the basics of computer programming in 60 minutes in a fun, simple way. It is part of a campaign thatCode.org, a non-profit organisation, launched in the US with the goal of introducing coding&nbsp;into the US curriculum and raising awareness around what coding is. The idea was to show that it's not just about the geek in the basement or the super-tech-savvy person but that it&nbsp;actually plays a role in everything we&nbsp;do and everybody should have access to it. And 20 million kids signed&nbsp;up to it.And I just thought, this is something&nbsp;we should be doing in the UK too. So I spoke to Joanna Shields [the former managing director of Facebook in Europe and now chair of Tech City] and Sherry Coutu [a tech investor] and they were both extremely&nbsp;excited about it. We decided&nbsp;to have it ready for 3 March, which is the 25th anniversary of the launch of the world wide web.We're not saying we want to build a nation of coders. We're saying, "Just go online and see what it means." The Hour of Code is actually a 60-minute set of tutorials, including one by Mark Zuckerberg and another where you write lines of code to get an Angry Bird to catch a little piggy.There are a lot of different people behind this. As well as the women that you see here, there is Martha Lane Fox, and Michael Acton Smith from Moshi Monsters. In the States, Will.i.am and President Obama appeared in the launch video. We want to tell boys&nbsp;and girls to just do it. It's easy, just give it a go.So, in terms of the makeup of this group of people who've come together this afternoon, you are all women, which is quite atypical, isn't it?&nbsp;Are you deliberately trying to challenge people's perceptions about&nbsp;what computer programmers look like?AvidAbsolutely, we want to demystify what code is about. It's not just geeks. It's cool people, it's women. You don't need to be a computer scientist to actually use code in real life. I run my own fashion accessories business. I run&nbsp;the development team there because I know how to code, and I've been able to build a business online in fashion partly thanks to a coding background.Karen Price,CEO of e-skills UK, the skills council for business and information technologyFrom September 2014 computing is going to be mandatory on the national curriculum through primary and secondary school. So that is a good thing, but we're trying to seize the moment in challenging negative stereotypes about working in technology. This is the moment to inspire a generation of young people so that kids will be proud to say they're&nbsp;doing it, rather than thinking it's slightly embarrassing.How do you find that as a teacher, Nicki? Do you find children are put off&nbsp;by the idea of being a computer geek?Nicki Cooper,computing teacher at Northfleet School for Girls, Kent, and a Computing at School master teacherA little bit. I've found working in an all-girls school very different from a mixed school because here the girls are really free to express themselves. They're quite happy that they're into Minecraft or have been building computer games. That's what we've been working on in lessons, and they've been really getting into it. Whereas when I was in a mixed school, the girls took a back seat and it was the boys that would be shouting out and getting enthusiastic. They saw it as a boys' thing.What about this idea that everybody needs to learn how to code? Haven't we just gone from one extreme to the other? Before, there was nothing about coding, it wasn't on the political agenda. And suddenly, everybody has to learn how to do it.Kathryn Parsons,co-founder of Decoded, which teaches individuals and companies how to codeIt's been really interesting, all the debate that's been happening around code in the last few weeks. I think it's important to expose children to skills, whether it be mathematics or code or whatever. This is a language that is powering everything that is happening in the world of technology at the moment. And you never know, kids might find they actually have a real talent for it. At the moment, they're not&nbsp;even being exposed to it. That is a huge problem. We hire a lot of programmers and the majority are self-taught.But to create a more broad male-female ratio and a larger skill set is a necessity. We certainly see it at Decoded.Why do you have a 19-year-old who wants to set up their own start-up, a mother with kids going back into the workplace after three years and being told she's being left behind, a CEO of a front-seat Fortune 500 company all sitting next to each other at a table learning the same thing? It's because nobody feels empowered or confident about the technologies that go on behind the screen. It shouldn't feel like it's a dark art, something that people are not allowed to learn.And back on to the gender issue, it's madness, I can't think of anything else in the world where you would say that there is a skill set that is uniquely male.What are the actual figures?KarenOnly one in six in the workforce is female at the moment, and that is perpetuated right through: 13% at university; 8% at A-level are female. So, the gender problem is substantial and endemic and getting worse.So presumably, Nicki, you studied computer science? What prompted you to buck that trend and be one of the few women who entered the field?NickiWhen I think back to my lecture hall, I was in a minority and us girls stuck together in quite a small group.  At my last school it was the same: there'd be 20 boys and one or two girls in every class.KarenI'm an English graduate and I went to work for a tech company, and they thought: "Gosh, we'll teach her to code." So I was taught to code. I did not make my career in programming, but I had a tech career and I think the training I got in technology gave me the knowledge I needed, the confidence I needed and the capability to do my job, which was to solve problems using technology.AvidI love its ability to help you solve problems, or innovate, or create. The UK is globally famous as being one of the most creative hot-beds in the world. Our creative industries are really, really famous. Then you look at the technology, and the ability to have an idea, and there's this huge cavernous gap.But then again, there are a lot of people who've been successful in the technology sector who haven't come from a coding background, aren't there?NickiI think the days of "I'm just going to let someone else do it, get a digital company to do it" are over, because people are beginning to realise that they've actually relinquished their creativity, research, planning, strategy – everything. And they don't even realise what they're sending off to be done elsewhere. If you want to own the research and the creativity and the innovation in what you do, you do need to understand it.So going back to the idea of the Hour of Code… can you learn anything meaningful in an hour? Isn't that a rather banal way of addressing what is a very complex issue?AvidWe're not trying to address the issue of how do we teach code, or how do we need to apply the curriculum – none of that. The Hour of Code is purely saying, give yourself an hour and just try it out. Just see what it is so that you realise that it's not this mystical thing, that it's not super-complicated. Just take that hour, try it out, do it with your children.NickiI watched a group of girls yesterday in the computing class physically getting excited, bouncing in their seats, making a racket, because they were writing a computer program and they got it to work.Is this curriculum change in September going to be a massive thing? Is this going to transform computer science?NickiYes, definitely. It does depend on the skill set of the department because a lot of ICT teachers have&nbsp;come from a non-computing background, so you've&nbsp;got a bit of a divide between those that are really excited about it and those who are finding it quite scary. In a lot of schools, nobody has necessarily said: "Do you need any support with this?"So is this one of those great political statements where the government says: "Yes, every child is going to be learning computing from the age of six", but has not worked out who actually is going to teach them?NickiIt's fantastic that we're doing it and there are tools in place to support teachers. For example, I've just trained to be a Computing in Schools master teacher, which means that I will be able to go out to schools and help train them. But there are a lot of ICT teachers out there who still have that skills gap. It is a worry. There does need to be more support from a government level to fund training.There does seem to be a lot of political bandwagon-jumping going on.When I did Kathryn's Decoded course&nbsp;a couple of years ago, it was a bit of a crazy idea to go off and learn to&nbsp;code. Now coding is everywhere and&nbsp;all politicians seem to have leaped on board.NickiIt used to be that if you said, "anyone and everyone can and should learn this" you sounded like a total nutcase. But the whole environment seems to have shifted in the last six months. It does feel like a very exciting&nbsp;time that there are places to go, like Hour of Code and Code.org, and Decoded.There seem to be a lot of organisations doing something similar but different. It's quite confusing. When I was researching Hour of Code, it took me a little while to figure out that this wasn't the same as Year of Code, which also launched recently.KathrynAnd, it's also the BBC's Year of Code next year…AvidThere is definitely confusion in terms of the messaging. I think we're all trying to work together to make this clearer. The Year of Code is not theBBC Year of Code, it's different. TheYear of Code, which was announced last week, is more of a campaign around all the things that are happening.Right, andthat drew a lot of criticism, didn't it?Including criticism&nbsp;that the director of it doesn't know how to code.KathrynThe thing is 98% of the UK doesn't&nbsp;know how to code. That's the point. And learning should be empowering.AvidAnd it has to be something that anyone and everyone, whatever age they are, whatever gender they are, feels that they have permission to go and study.KarenI also think code has become the shorthand for talking about things that are much broader than coding. This innate ability that young people have with technology isn't recognised by traditional employers. Most young people know how to organise a party, or get a group of people together around an event on Facebook, and a lot of companies want to use social media to achieve something similar, but they don't connect that with that kind of ability. Many parents are saying: "The world is changing, and I want my child to have the best opportunity to get a good career in this world of technology, and if learning to code gives them a good foundation, then that is what we are going to do."Avid,Boticca.comis a fashion&nbsp;website, which is about as girly as it gets, but you've come at it from a hard engineering background, haven't you?AvidI studied engineering and as part of this I did computer science courses. I later got jobs at eBay and Skype, and what I loved about it is that you do something one day and then the next day it's there. You have immediate impact. I love technology but I never thought I could do a job that combined technology and fashion until I startedBoticcawith my business partner and I realised, I'm a girl, I like being a girl, I like my accessories, I like my fashion. But I thought that was one aspect of my life and the other aspect was being an engineer and working with engineers. But that was not true. One of&nbsp;the reasons my business partner came to me with this idea was&nbsp;because&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;the background I&nbsp;have.KathrynThe thing is that everybody is going to have to feel confident and literate about technology in the digital world because it's affecting everybody's lives, everybody's businesses. The products that are powering our lives have been invented and created by the skillsets of men. This is digital history. And women have to be a part of writing it.
Houses without broadband could be worth as much as 20% less than comparable properties with a good connection, according to experts who say superfast speeds are increasingly important to prospective homebuyers.With soaring numbers going online to perform everyday tasks or to work from home, a robust connection is considered so vital that the property search website Rightmove has added a broadband speed checker button to every one of its listings, alongside details of transport links and schools. Estate agents report that rising numbers of buyers are willing to pull out of a deal if broadband is not available in that area.Bernard Phillips, the head of consumer platforms at Rightmove, said: "We already offer a number of tools to help consumers make informed decisions about a property, and we're pleased to be the first to add broadband speeds to this. Broadband has become ingrained in people's lives and is an important factor when choosing a home."Yet many households – particularly those in rural and hard-to-reach areas of the UK – remain stuck on sluggish speeds of 2Mbps (megabits per second) or less. That can make anything aside from sending and receiving emails a struggle. The government's rollout of the superfast network to reach 95% of the UK, promising downloads at more than 30Mbps, has been pushed back to 2017. The latest figures from the communications regulator, Ofcom, show that 73% of the country is currently able to access these speeds.This is despite the fact that broadband is now regarded as "the fourth utility" after gas, water and electricity, according to property expert Henry Pryor. "A home without at least a standard broadband connection could be worth up to 20% less than a comparable property," said Pryor. "The more demanding buyers now want fibre-optic superfast speeds as, whether working from home, streaming entertainment or managing the stack of equipment that now relies on this, a property needs to have 21st-century connectivity."Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, which has seen a 27% rise in the number of people seeking help over broadband and internet issues since April last year, said: "A poor internet service can shut people out of contributing to the national economy, and people living in rural areas can find unreliable internet a particular struggle."Frank Speir of property buying agency Prime Purchase said: "Seven or eight years ago, the issue of broadband speeds was never brought up by clients. Six years ago they started mentioning them as something nice to have, and now it is absolutely fundamental to many buyers that they have fast broadband."One client buying in a small hamlet of four houses just outside Oxford went so far as to club together with neighbours to lay four miles of cable to get high-speed broadband, he added. "It cost them £50,000 each, but they considered it worth it, as it enabled them to work from home and would also make the properties far more attractive to buyers in the future."Charles Birtles, a buying agent working in Wiltshire and Hampshire, said: "Recently I had a client who was moving from London to Hampshire and a condition of the sale was internet speed. Unless the seller could prove that his home has access to high-speed internet, he would not proceed with the purchase."This follows news that Ofcom is consulting on performance targets that BT Openreach must meet – or face possible fines. Openreach, which manages access to the UK's copper telephone network that underpins almost every broadband connection, has been heavily criticised by customers for being mismanaged and understaffed. Thousands of households have complained that they face waiting weeks or months to be connected to broadband.Ofcom stipulated that from next month Openreach will have to repair around 67% of reported faults within two working days. It will also have to provide an appointment for around 54% of new line installations within 12 working days. By April 2016, 80% of problems will have to be dealt with within those time constraints.• This article was amended on Sunday 2 March 2014. Ofcom figures show that 73% of the country is currently able to access download speeds of more than 30Mbps, not 19% as we said. This has been corrected.• This article was further amended on 18 March 2014 to correctly identify Charles Birtles as a buying agent, not an estate agent.
The worst part of my job as a materials scientist is going to conferences. They are often turgid affairs conducted in the ballrooms of hotels so identical to one another that you can't tell whether you are in Singapore or Manchester. The same speakers are there, for the most part droning on about the same thing they droned on about at the last conference. I should know, I am one of them.But occasionally, just occasionally, someone says something so radically new that it causes you sit up and actually listen. Your neighbours are no longer fiddling with their smartphones; there is the proverbial buzz in the air.This was the scene at theMaterials Research Society conference in Bostonlast December, where a breakthrough in perovskite solar cells was announced. If perovskites mean nothing to you read on, as they may have a very big impact on your future fuel bill.If we could capture approximately 1% of the sunlight falling on to the British Isles and turn it into electricity we would meet our current energy demands. The reason no one suggests doing this rather than building wind, nuclear or conventional power stations is the cost. We currently use silicon solar cells to turn sunlight into electricity but they are expensive and require subsidies.Silicon is a poor conductor of electricity because all of its four outer electrons are bound up in the chemical bonds holding the crystal together. However, by adding a tiny amount of phosphorous, which has five outer electrons, you effectively add a free electron to the crystal and make it conduct moderately well. Similarly, you can add boron, which has only three outer electrons, and effectively do the same thing, only now the conducting charge is called an electron&nbsp;hole.The magic comes when you put a phosphorous silicon layer next to a boron silicon layer: the holes and the electrons cancel each other out at the junction but create an electric field that means that electrons only like to flow in one direction across the junction. This is called a diode.There are many flavours of diodes, each having a different junction architecture. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit light when electrons flow across the junction but the opposite effect also works: light hitting the diode creates an electric current, and this is how a solar cell works.Silicon solar cells are as intricately micro-engineered as the silicon chips in your smartphone or tablet, but instead of being the size of a postage stamp they are the size of a table. They are made in enormous billion-dollar clean-room and high-temperature fabrication facilities, which are expensive precisely because controlling the purity of the silicon and the doping levels of phosphorous and boron is not trivial. It is also energy intensive. Although prices have been coming down, fossil fuels are still so cheap it is very hard for silicon solar cells to compete.Materials scientists have been exploring other semiconductor technologies for a long while, trying to find something cheaper and better than silicon. Until recently the best bet wasdye-sensitised solar cells. These have been around since the 1980s, but they have not managed to make a big impact on the energy market because, although they are cheap because they don't require billion-dollar clean-room facilities, their efficiency is generally low. This is where the new perovskite solar cells come in. There are exotic-sounding compounds, such as methylammonium trihalogen plumbates, that have a quite simple crystal structure called a perovskite. Like the dye-sensitised solar cells, these solar cells are easy and cheap to make, but they have another trick up their sleeve – they don't need a complicated diode architecture to achieve high efficiencies.Materials researchers in Oxford, led by Dr Henry Snaith,have recently shownthat they can make simple perovskite solar cells with efficiencies pushing 20%. This is big news, because 20% makes them competitive with existing commercial silicon solar cellswhile being much cheaper to make in high volumes. They are also more suitable for incorporating into roofing materials and glass panels than silicon and so have the clear potential of being as fundamental to our city architecture as steel, concrete and asphalt. In other words, they could well be the materials that will make it possible to collect the 1% of solar energy we need as a nation, at a cost that can compete with fossil&nbsp;fuels.Hearing research results such as this makes you grudgingly admit conferences are worth going to, and indeed gets you wondering whether we might look back in 10 years and pinpoint this as the time the solar energy revolution really ignited. One of my industry colleagues believes so; after the talk he immediately Skyped his research group, told them to stop what they were doing and get working on perovskite solar cells. The race to commercialise them is on.
Google has celebrated St David's Day with a doodle depicting a red dragon taking tea with a woman wearing the traditional Welsh national costume of a tall black bonnet and a long red dress.St David's Day – or Dydd Gŵyl Dewi Sant – is the feast day of Saint David, the patron saint of Wales, and falls on 1 March every year.Saint David was born towards the end of the 5th century and became renowned as a teacher and preacher, founding monastic settlements and churches. The date of his death is recorded as 1 March, though the year of his death is uncertain.Schools and cultural societies across Wales commemorate Saint David with parades and concerts, and it is traditional to wear daffodils or strips of leek on lapels and caps.
Think of aRange Roverand what comes to mind? A school run in south-west London, horrid straw-hatted brats in the back, mum&nbsp;on the phone while driving? Or maybe footballers, pop stars, shady geezers in shades, criminals, politicians, drug dealers…? All correct. And it's the same sort of story for a Land Rover Discovery.What about a Toyota Land Cruiser, though, which on paper at least is a rival to the above? Ah, now you're thinking of difficult, troubled places far away, right? The actual English countryside? Yes, OK, but I mean even more difficult and more troubled, where the delivery of aid is required, plus goodwill, peacekeeping possibly. The U frickin' N, that's what I'm talking about – and I don't mean chauffeuring Ban Ki-moon to work along FDR Drive in New York, but out there in the Balkans (Land Cruisers have been around for a while), Africa etc. Some might argue a Land Cruiser's rugged go-anywhereness is actually more effective than the United Nations.I'll be honest: we didn't take this latest incarnation of Toyota's SUV to Africa, or even the Balkans. But we did make it to the actual English countryside – even a little way along an unpaved track at one point, though I can't claim to have put its off-road capabilities to any serious test. You can just tell – from the ride height, and all the 4WD settings – that it would happily cope with whatever Somalia or wherever threw at it.It was still very useful. We were making a video – the subject matter isn't important – and this vast vehicle effortlessly swallowed all the equipment and people required. There was even filming from the back, while moving, with the tailgate window open. (Annoying beeping, though – there's got to be a way of stopping that, hasn't there, for when you need to have a stretcher or something sticking out of the back, man down in Mogadishu?) OK, so it was Northamptonshire, but it could have been somewhere more challenging.Inside, this high-spec model is trying to be a bit posh, with leather upholstery, a fancy touchscreen, all that. That's the direction the Land Cruiser has tried to go over its generations: socially upwards.But you're never going to find a&nbsp;Beckham or any self-respecting drug dealer in a Toyota Land Cruiser. It doesn't have either the urban chic or the refined road manners. In truth, in spite of the leather, the touchscreen and the parking sensors, it's still a bit agricultural at heart. Basically, it's trying to be a Range Rover now (prices heading that way,&nbsp;too) and failing. And that's a&nbsp;shame. Not so much that it's failing, but that it's even trying.Toyota Land Cruiser Invincible AutoPrice£52,495Top speed109mphAcceleration0-62mph in 11 secondsCombined fuel consumption34.9 mpgCO2emissions213g/kmEcorating3/10Cool rating6/10
Barcelona’s big and beautiful Mobile World Congress is over for another year, leaving us with a tantalising glimpse into the mobile future - and a slew of fascinating, internet-connected devices. Expect these on a high street near you soon.The smart basketballThe first smart basketball, the 94Fifty packs sensor to monitor force, acceleration, spin and other movements created aspiring progressional basketball players. It connects to a smartphone delivering real-time feedback in about 100 milliseconds, for the ultimate in basketball training analysis.H2O PalA small rubber disc that turns any water bottle into a smart bottle, the H2O Pal clips onto the bottom of your drinking receptacle and monitors just how much water you drink as you go about your day. It connects to a smartphone and nags you when you haven’t drunk your quota of water for the day.Skuplt AimIf getting the perfect muscle tone is your aim, then Skuplt has a device for you. This strange device promises to fire electricity into your muscle, measuring body composition and analysing individual muscles for fat content and quality in seconds. It will then set training goals for improved fitness and strength.Oral B SmartSeries connected toothbrushOral B’s latest innovation is a toothbrush that talks to your smartphone over Bluetooth, guiding and recording your brushing using built in sensors, allowing personalised routines and even letting your dentist see just how well you’ve been scrubbing your pearly whites.Bionym NymiThis wristband aims to replace usernames and passwords with a one-stop bio-authentication shop. It monitors the unique pattern of the heart beat to identify the wearer, acting like a key to almost anything, including online accounts, connecting wirelessly to locks or computers.•2014 is the year of the smart watch - and the toothbrush
A new smart toothbrush unveiled this week could monitor how well you brush your teeth, and could one day be used to send data back to your dentist.Oral B’s Smartseries toothbrush, which launched in the UK in June priced at £199, sends data back to a smartphone app recording how many brushstrokes are used, targeting problem areas and following personalised brushing routines.This vision of the internet-connected future was just one of the gadgets unveiled this week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which kicked off with a keynote from an exuberant Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.Explaining the company’s $19bn acquisition of the messaging app WhatsApp, MWC’s 75,000-strong audience was abuzz with what the deal would mean for mobile networks, and whether WhatsApp’s latest move into voice technology would threaten traditional mobile businesses.For Facebook, expansion depends on gaining users in developing markets, where the mobile phone is king and mobile broadband outstrips traditional internet three to one, according to data from the International Telecommunication Union.But it was the internet of things - connecting physical devices to the internet - preoccupying the discussions of mobile phone networks. The potential is vast, and operators are excited by potential expansion of providing data services to everything from toothbrushes and fridges to cars and washing machines.“We currently have 13m devices connected to our network, of which 1.6m of those connections are machine-to-machine,” said Olaf Swantee, chief executive of EE talking to the Guardian. “We are working to grow those connections up to 32m and M2M connections are going to play a very big part in that.”The goal is to turn everything into a smart, data-driven device. Cars could talk to the road about black ice, fridges could order food automatically when it runs out, or you could ask your washing machine “how are you getting on?” and the washing machine could reply “almost there sir, just on the spin cycle, I’ll be done in 15 minutes”.These machine-to-machine (M2M) connections are expected to number 250m globally by the end of 2014, according to data from the GSMA. To support the vast number of devices networks are working on capacity and speed, so there were plenty of companies keen to show off hardware that enables super fast connectivity.In another corner of the trade show South Korean Telecom demonstrated its next generation 4G mobile data network, which is capable of delivering speeds of up to 450 megabits per second – over three times as fast as the fastest standard UK home broadband. Nokia Solutions &amp; Networks claimed to be the ultimate king of speed, supplying data at 2.6Gbps or 2,600Mbps. At that speed, a very large 4K ultra high definition film could be downloaded in seconds.For the high street, however, the first wave of a more connected world will be yet more devices to track health and fitness.South Korean giant Samsung launched three new smartwatches, the Gear 2, Gear 2 Neo and Gear Fit, each with a built in heart-rate monitor.Signalling an increasingly intense battle between the mobile phone makers, Huawei also launched a fitness tracker for the wrist but that can convert to a headset to take phone calls. Sony already has a smartwatch and a fitness band, while both Motorola and HTC are working on a smart wearable.Mobile World Congress 2014 may not have been the year that internet connected devices became mainstream, but it will certainly be remembered as the year of the smartwatch.•Five quirky connected gadgets, from basketballs to water bottles•Oral B’s smart toothbrush lets dentists spy on your brushing

Click here to viewCreated by refugees from the studio behind the better Call Of Duties, Titanfall is an antidote to the ennui descending around the annual entries in the cashcow franchise. Although not due out for a couple of weeks, the beta provided a glimpse of the high explosive joy to come. Rather than soldiers, you play as a pilot, initially left to run about the game's beautifully dilapidated cityscapes on foot, picking off enemy pilots and their support troops. Once a timer runs out you can call down a titan, a house-sized walking tank with interchangeable armaments and a force field, into which you climb and start unleashing electric death. The unique ebb and flow the titans bring to battles, and the beautifully orchestrated wall runs and rocket-powered double jumps the pilots perform, make this a spectacular and breathless experience quite unlike current, suddenly prosaic-looking GI simulators.

Thief has much in common with Dishonored, from its preference for subtlety and non-lethality over violence to its beautiful, functional architecture. Although Thief tends to be slightly less open-ended, there's still a lot left up to you, so you can choose your own route through sprawling streets, rooftops and conveniently man-sized ventilation pipes, helped by special arrows that let you douse torches, distract or disorientate guards and, of course, spear them through the head. The game's thoughtful pace still creates tension – picking locks before a patrolling guard spots you; ducking into shadows without disturbing a napping guard dog – along with the ever-present friction between staying undetected and a desire to steal absolutely everything.

I’m looking for a good 7in or 8in tablet, and I don’t know what to do. It doesn’t have to have a super-duper HD retina display or Dolby sound. I use it mainly for Microsoft Exchange email, browsing, watching the occasional BBC video or live news etc, and running a few apps. I’m not a gamer.Currently, I’m using a Kindle Fire to fill the gap, but it’s very limited both in terms of capabilities (what can be installed) and grunt.I have bought four Android tablets -- a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 (Wi-Fi/3g) in 2011 and three Google Nexus 7 tablets, including new and old models -- and they have all had problems. This year I tried another 2012 Nexus 7. All was well for a few days until Android updated to KitKat (4.4.2 KOT49H), when I started having exactly the same touch screen problems as I had had with both 2013 units. Having frequently suffered from things being broken by Android updates, this has just made me sick of Android.I thought perhaps of a Windows 8 (not RT) tablet. I like the idea of being able to run some of my desktop software on a tablet, but they are just too expensive.I also did something I thought I’d never do -- consider an Apple device -- so I’ve been reading up on the iPad Mini. The old model is now going for around £215, and I don’t really want to go too much higher. However, I’m not a fan of the Apple “closed” system or having iTunes installed: years ago it completely trashed my PC. Also, when I tried an iPad Mini in John Lewis, the video clips on the BBC News website wouldn’t play. The sales assistant told me the only way to watch BBC videos was by using the BBC News app, which curiously didn’t work.BrianI’m tempted to suggest a BlackBerry tablet as that may be the only one you haven’t tried, and they are very cheap. However, the fact is that Android is the only real choice in the cheap tablet market (£50-£200) apart from Amazon’s Kindle Fire, and you already have one of those. Also, it’s not much of an alternative in the sense that it uses a forked version of the open source part of Android, without the proprietary Google layer that provides access to Google Play etc.When it comes to choosing between an Apple iPad and a Windows 8 tablet, they are different beasts with different capabilities. You’d usually choose an iPad to get access to the vast selection of high-quality apps, which have actually been designed for tablets rather than phones. You’d usually choose a Windows 8 tablet because it provides access to the vast selection of Windows programs. The Windows Store now has about 240,000 tablet apps and covers most needs, but it’s still nowhere near the iPad’s ecosystem.I don’t think there’s actually much difference in terms of ease of use in tablet mode, once you have learned the specific edge-swipes that do special things in the Metro-sorry-modern interface. (If you won’t learn those, you have no chance.) Most of the complaints about Windows 8 have been about using the tablet interface to access desktop features, and Microsoft is in the process of fixing those.I’ve been using a Haswell-powered Surface Pro 2 on loan from Microsoft, and while it has many improvements over the first version, the experience hasn’t really changed the views I expressed when I reviewed it here (Microsoft Surface Pro review: a device of many talents). It’s amazingly versatile. For example, you can use it as a desktop with full size keyboard and monitor -- or several monitors -- and its Wacom-style pen-operated graphics make it exceptionally good value for creative types. It also makes life simpler when you can do PC-level photo and video editing then switch to tablet-style viewing on the same machine. It’s dramatically cheaper than buying a desktop, an Ultrabook, a graphics tablet, and a tablet. On the other hand, it’s not the optimum choice for any particular function, and if you don’t need all the features, it’s an expensive option.It’s true that Windows 8 tablet hybrids can cost from about £350 to over £1,000, but new tablets with 8in screens are very much cheaper, and prices now start at about £250. (Or, for American buyers, about $250.) They can still do all the good stuff, such as supporting multiple monitors, though usually without the high-resolution digitising pen input. The obvious drawback is that an 8in screen is very small for running desktop programs, especially if you don’t know them well enough to use keyboard shortcuts.The cost savings come from the smaller screen sizes and the use of 32-bit Intel Atom chips with 2GB of memory. However, the new Bay Trail chips are dramatically better than the old Atoms used in netbooks. For example, the Z3770 is roughly as fast as an Intel Celeron 1007U or a low-voltage Core i3-4010Y, and ahead of old staples such as the second-gen Core i3-2375M. Of course, the extra efficiency of Windows 8 helps as well.Cheaper Windows?There may be further price reductions to come, both through economies of scale -- production is still ramping up -- and because Microsoft might cut the price of Windows 8 on ultra low cost PCs.You may know that netbooks were cheap partly because Microsoft offered manufacturers a special version of Windows XP called Home Edition ULCPC for “ultra low cost personal computers”. The rumoured price was closer to $15 than the usual $45, but it was basically free money for Microsoft -- XP had reached the end of its very profitable life -- and netbook manufacturers preferred it to free Linux. Today, the competition is with free Android, and Microsoft is willing to cut the price because it wants to sell more copies of Windows 8. (And it needs to sell more Windows 8 tablets to encourage developers to write more apps for the Windows Store.)Anyway, on February 22,Bloombergreported: “Manufacturers will be charged $15 to license Windows 8.1 and preinstall it on devices that retail for less than $250, instead of the usual fee of $50, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details aren’t public. The discount will apply to any products that meet the price limit, with no restrictions on the size or type of device, the people said.”Currently there are exactly zero Windows 8.1 devices designed to retail for less than $250 (though you might get one in a sale), so if the story is true, Microsoft is trying to penetrate a part of the market that now goes by default to Android devices and low-end Chromebooks in the $199.99 to $249.99 price range.Windows 8 mini-tabletsIf you fancy trying an 8in Windows 8 tablet, there are several to choose from. The notable ones include the Dell Venue 8 Pro, Toshiba Encore, Acer Iconia W4, Lenovo MiiX 2 and Asus VivoTab Note 8.The cheapest I can see at the moment is aToshiba Encore 8with 32GB of storage on sale (£50 off) for £199.99 at PC World. This has micro-USB and micro HDMI ports so you could plug it into a monitor or TV set, and apparently includes £100-worth of Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013. This is the same price as a Nexus 7 and cheaper than your discounted iPad Mini, without even counting the extra cost of Apple cables.The rule of thumb is that 32GB on Windows tablets is equivalent to 16GB on Android and iPad tablets, but you can improve on that using tips from thisGuide to Maximizing Disk Space on your Dell Venue 8 Pro (or other Windows 8.1 system). The standard tricks include copying off the Recovery platform, which saves 5GB or 6GB, and mounting a fast 64GB SD card as Permanent Storage.I have nothing against the iPad Mini: when I had one on loan from Apple, I liked it a lot and gave it a five-star review. It played BBC videos perfectly, and colours looked more naturalistic than they did on a Kindle Fire. Also, if you want access to the iPad ecosystem, it’s the cheapest option. However, a Windows tablet will do the tablety things you need, and it will enable you to RDP into your desktop PC, and stream videos via an Xbox, if you have one. It will also run Adobe Flash and standard desktop PC software using a PC or wireless Bluetooth keyboard. And you won’t be forced to install iTunes.
MtGox filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo on Friday, with the world’s former biggest bitcoin exchange blaming “a weakness in our system” for its collapse.The exchange’s CEO Mark Karpeles, bowing, apologised at a news conference for causing trouble to so many people, and said that he intended to launch a criminal complaint against the hacking attack which caused the site’s downfall. However, he added, he had no specific means to do so.Mt Gox had liquid liabilities of 6.5bn yen (£38m), dwarfing its total assets of 3.84bn yen (£22.6m), the company said. It had 127,000 creditors in bankruptcy, just over 1,000 of whom are Japanese.The news conference is Karpeles’ second public statement since MtGox deleted its website on Tuesday, following a terse comment released on Wednesday.The “weakness” referred to by Karpeles is thought to be an issue related to “transaction malleability“, a loophole in the bitcoin system which was exploited by malicious actors to get free bitcoins from the site.“MtGox filing for bankruptcy is not the end of bitcoin but it is the beginning of the end of bitcoin in its current form,” says currency trader Alistair Cotton of Currencies Direct.“Over the last year we’ve seen ever-increasing usage and with it huge volatility in value and blows from banks and regulators. These are growing pains as the currency evolves in front of our eyes and the MtGox bankruptcy is part of that.”•How did a bug in bitcoin lead to MtGox’s collapse?
In a nondescript industrial estate in El Segundo, a&nbsp;boxy suburb in south-west Los Angeles just a&nbsp;mile or two from LAX international airport, 20 people wait in a windowless canteen for a&nbsp;ceremony to begin. Outside, the sun is shining on an unseasonably warm February day; inside, the only light comes from the glare of halogen bulbs.There is a strange mix of accents – predominantly American, but smatterings of Swedish, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese can be heard around the room, as men and women (but mostly men) chat over pepperoni pizza and 75-cent vending machine soda. In the corner, an Asteroids arcade machine blares out tinny music and flashing lights.It might be a fairly typical office scene, were it not for the extraordinary security procedures that everyone in this room has had to complete just to get here, the sort of measures normally reserved for nuclear launch codes or presidential visits. The reason we are all here sounds like the stuff of science fiction, or the plot of a new Tom Cruise franchise: the ceremony we are about to witness sees the coming together of a group of people, from all over the world, who each hold a key to the internet. Together, their keys create a master key, which in turn controls one of the central security measures at the core of the web. Rumours about the power of these keyholders abound: could their key switch off the internet? Or, if someone somehow managed to bring the whole system down, could they turn it on again?The keyholders have been meeting four times a&nbsp;year, twice on the east coast of the US and twice here on the west, since 2010. Gaining access to their inner sanctum isn't easy, but last month I&nbsp;was invited along to watch the ceremony and meet some of the keyholders – a select group of security experts from around the world. All have long backgrounds in internet security and work for various international institutions. They were chosen for their geographical spread as well as their experience – no one country is allowed to have too many keyholders. They travel to the ceremony at their own, or their employer's, expense.What these men and women control is the system at the heart of the web: the domain name system, or DNS. This is the internet's version of a&nbsp;telephone directory – a series of registers linking web addresses to a series of numbers, called IP addresses. Without these addresses, you would need to know a long sequence of numbers for every site you wanted to visit. To get to the Guardian, for instance, you'd have to enter "77.91.251.10" instead oftheguardian.com.'Each of the 14 primary keyholders owns a traditional metal key to a safety deposit box, which in turn contains a smartcard, which in turn activates a machine that creates a new master key.' Photograph: Laurence Mathieu for the GuardianThe master key is part of a new global effort to make the whole domain name system secure and the internet safer: every time the keyholders meet, they are verifying that each entry in these online "phone books" is authentic. This prevents a&nbsp;proliferation of fake web addresses which could lead people to malicious sites, used to hack computers or steal credit card details.The east and west coast ceremonies each have seven keyholders, with a further seven people around the world who could access a last-resort measure to reconstruct the system if something calamitous were to happen. Each of the 14 primary keyholders owns a traditional metal key to a&nbsp;safety deposit box, which in turn contains a&nbsp;smartcard, which in turn activates a machine that creates a&nbsp;new master key. The backup keyholders have something a bit different: smartcards that contain a fragment of code needed to build a&nbsp;replacement key-generating machine. Once a&nbsp;year, these shadow holders send the organisation that runs the system – theInternet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers(Icann) – a&nbsp;photograph of themselves with that day's newspaper and their key, to verify that all is well.The fact that the US-based, not-for-profit organisation Icann – rather than a government or an international body – has one of the biggest jobs in maintaining global internet security has inevitably come in for criticism. Today's occasionally over-the-top ceremony (streamed live on Icann's website) is intended to prove how seriously they are taking this responsibility. It's one partThe Matrix(the tech and security stuff) to two partsThe Office(pretty much everything else).For starters: to get to the canteen, you have to walk through a door that requires a pin code, a&nbsp;smartcard and a biometric hand scan. This takes you into a "mantrap", a small room in which only one door at a time can ever be open. Another sequence of smartcards, handprints and codes opens the exit. Now you're in the break room.Already, not everything has gone entirely to plan. Leaning next to the Atari arcade machine, ex-state department official Rick Lamb, smartly suited and wearing black-rimmed glasses (he admits he's dressed up for the occasion), is telling someone that one of the on-site guards had asked him out loud, "And your security pin is 9925, yes?" "Well, it was…" he says, with an eye-roll. Looking in our direction, he says it's already been changed.'Rumours about the power of these keyholders abound: could their key switch off the internet? Or, if someone somehow managed to bring the whole system down, could they turn it on again?' Illustration: Aaron Tilley Photograph: Aaron Tilley for the GuardianLamb is now a senior programme manager for Icann, helping to roll out the new, secure system for verifying the web. This is happening fast, but it is not yet fully in play. If the master key were lost or stolen today, the consequences might not be calamitous: some users would receive security warnings, some networks would have problems, but not much more. But once everyone has moved to the new, more secure system (this is expected in the next three to five years), the effects of losing or damaging the key would be far graver. While every server would still be there, nothing would connect: it would all register as untrustworthy. The whole system, the backbone of the internet, would need to be rebuilt over weeks or months. What would happen if an intelligence agency or hacker – theNSAorSyrian Electronic Army, say – got hold of a copy of the master key? It's possible they could redirect specific targets to fake websites designed to exploit their computers – although Icann and the keyholders say this is unlikely.Standing in the break room next to Lamb is Dmitry Burkov, one of the keyholders, a brusque and heavy-set Russian security expert on the boards of several internet NGOs, who has flown in from Moscow for the ceremony. "The key issue with internet governance is always trust," he says. "No matter what the forum, it always comes down to trust." Given the tensions between Russia and the US, and Russia's calls for new organisations to be put in charge of the internet, does he have faith in this current system? He gestures to the room at large: "They're the best part of Icann." I take it he means he likes these people, and not the wider organisation, but he won't be drawn further.It's time to move to the ceremony room itself, which has been cleared for the most sensitive classified information. No electrical signals can come in or out. Building security guards are barred, as are cleaners. To make sure the room looks decent for visitors, an east coast keyholder, Anne-Marie Eklund Löwinder of Sweden, has been in the day before to vacuum with a $20 dustbuster.We're about to begin a detailed, tightly scripted series of more than 100 actions, all recorded to the minute using the GMT time zone for consistency. These steps are a strange mix of high-security measures lifted straight from a&nbsp;thriller (keycards, safe combinations, secure cages), coupled with more mundane technical details – a bit of trouble setting up a printer – and occasional bouts of farce. In short, much like the internet itself.Lynn Lipinski, PR for Icann, signs the official register of the key ceremony. Photograph: Laurence Mathieu for the GuardianAs we step into the ceremony room, 16 men and four women, it is just after lunchtime in LA and 21.14 GMT. As well as the keyholders, there are several witnesses here to make sure no one can find some sneaky back door into the internet. Some are security experts, others are laypeople, two are auditors from PricewaterhouseCoopers (with global online trade currently well in excess of $1tn, the key has a serious role to play in business security). Lamb uses an advanced iris scanner to let us all in."Please centre your eyes," the tinny automated voice tells him. "Please come a little closer to the camera… Sorry, we cannot confirm your identity."Lamb sighs and tries again."Thank you, your identity has been verified."We file into a space that resembles a doctor's waiting room: two rows of bolted-down metal seats facing a desk. Less like a doctor's waiting room are the networks of cameras live-streaming to Icann's website. At one side of the room is a&nbsp;cage containing two high-security safes.Francisco Arias, Icann's director of technical services, acts as today's administrator. It is his first time, and his eyes regularly flick to the script.  To start with, things go according to plan. Arias and the four keyholders (the ceremony requires a&nbsp;minimum of three, not all seven) enter the secure cage to retrieve their smartcards, held in tamper-evident bags. Middle-aged men wearing checked shirts and jeans, they are Portuguese keyholder João Damas, based in Spain; American Edward Lewis, who works for an internet and security analytics firm; and Uruguayan Carlos Martinez, who works forLacnic, the internet registry for Latin America and the Caribbean.All but one of the 21 keyholders has been with the organisation since the very first ceremony. The initial selection process was surprisingly low-key: there was an advertisement on Icann's site, which generated just 40 applications for 21 positions. Since then, only one keyholder has resigned:Vint Cerf, one of the fathers of the internet, now in his 70s and employed as "chief internet evangelist" by Google. At the very first key ceremony, in Culpeper, Virginia, Cerf told the room that the principle of one master key lying at the core of networks was a major milestone. "More has happened here today than meets the eye," he said then. "I would predict that… in the long run this hierarchical structure of trust will be applied to a number of other functions that require strong authentication." But Cerf struggled with the travel commitment and dropped his keyholder duties.At 21.29, things go awry. A security controller slams the door of the safe shut, triggering a&nbsp;seismic sensor, which in turn triggers automatic door locks. The ceremony administrator and the keyholders are all locked in an 8ft square cage. Six minutes of quiet panic go by before they hit on a solution: trigger an alarm and an evacuation. Sirens blare and everyone piles out to mill around in the corridor until we can get back to the 100-point script. Every deviation has to be noted on anofficial record, which everyone present must read and sign off at a later point. Meanwhile, we use the downtime to snack: people rip open a few bags of Oreo biscuits and Cheez-Its.'At 21.29, things go awry. A security controller slams the safe door shut, triggering a seismic sensor, which in turn triggers door locks. The keyholders are locked in an 8ft square cage.' Photograph: Laurence Mathieu for the GuardianBoth the US commerce department and the Department of Homeland Security take a&nbsp;close interest, to differing degrees, in Icann's operations. In the wake of the ongoing revelations of NSA spying, and of undermined internet security, this does not sit well with many of Icann's overseas partners. Some, including Russia and Brazil –whose president has made such demands very public– are calling for a&nbsp;complete overhaul of how the internet is run, suggesting it should be put under UN auspices.The question of who put Icann in charge is hotly contested. Lamb argues that "it's the online community; it's the people who've put Icann in charge". Eklund Löwinder, the Swedish keyholder who vacuumed the day before, puts it more bluntly. "Well, mainly, it was the US Department of Commerce," she says. The European Commission wants changes to this system, though it still expresses its faith in Icann; the EU recently called for a "clear timeline for the globalisation of Icann".Eklund Löwinder explains that while the security might occasionally seem ridiculous, every step is very important when it comes to maintaining trust. "It's a system based on backups of backups, layers and layers of security," she says, her dangly cat earrings swinging. "Of course it is a bit romantic and thrilling to be a part of this, because I am a romantic by heart. I have to admit I love the internet. It's a piece of engineering art you have to admire. And to be able to contribute to make this a safer place makes me feel good."Where does she keep her key? She admits she has two copies, in case she loses one; one of them never leaves a bank deposit box. The other, which she uses twice a year in the ceremonies on the east coast, is attached to a long metal chain. Most of the time it sits in a wooden puzzle box, with a hidden lock, created by her furniture designer son.By 22.09 (we are all sticking to GMT) the ceremony is back on and everyone's returning to&nbsp;the script. The high-security machine that will&nbsp;generate the master key is set up. Once activated by the smartcards, this will produce a&nbsp;lengthy cryptographic code. If dropped, or even knocked too hard, the machine will self-destruct.Now that everything has been removed from the safes, we move to act two of the ceremony: the key signing. The first step would be familiar to anyone – getting the laptop plugged in and booting it up – but some witnesses watch like hawks, logging and initialising each step. Others are beginning to flag, checking their watches or having whispered conversations with their neighbours.At 22.40, a series of USB drives is set up, one of which will be used to load the signed key on to the live internet at the end of the ceremony: this is when the code is uploaded to the servers that dictate who controls .com, .net, .co.uk and more.The output of the previous ceremony is checked, to make sure people are working off the same key – a process that requires Arias to read aloud a 64-character code. Everyone nods as they verify it against their sheets.'A web security expert steps forward to read out a nonsense sequence of words generated by the previous key: "Flatfoot warranty brickyard Camelot blackjack vagabond…"’ Photograph: Laurence Mathieu for the GuardianAt 22.48 the high-security machine – a small, plain grey box with a keypad and card slot in front – is wired up. Each keyholder hands over his individual smartcard. Then, at 22.59, nearly two hours after the ceremony began, it's show time. Alejandro Bolivar, an American expert from Verisign, the security company that administers the "root zone" of the domain name system, steps forward to read out a nonsense sequence of words generated by the previous key. He begins: "Flatfoot warranty brickyard Camelot…" and continues for nearly a&nbsp;minute before concluding, "blackjack vagabond." The sequence corresponds with the witnesses' notes, so they nod and sign their script. A short line of code is typed into the laptop at 23.02, and seconds later the new key is signed, to a&nbsp;smattering of applause.After a 20-minute sequence of disconnecting secure machines and powering down the laptop, a USB stick is handed to Tomofumi Okubo, another Icann staffer. Deliberately or otherwise, Okubo makes a slight bow as he is passed the stick holding the "signed" digital key. Later Okubo will transmit the key on a secure channel to Verisign and this signed key will be made live across the internet. It will take effect for three months, from 1 April (yes, really). After that, the key will expire and error messages will start to appear across the internet.Given how high the stakes are, and the number of possible targets, does Okubo think the system is trustworthy? "I think so," he says. "You'd have to compromise a lot of people…" He trails off.Does this often slightly bizarre ceremony work? Are the security precautions integral, or just for show?Bruce Schneier, an American cryptologist and security expert who worked withGlenn Greenwaldand the Guardian to analyse some of the files leaked byEdward Snowden, suggests it's a little of both. "A lot of it is necessary, and some of it is necessary theatre," he concedes. "This process is both technical and political, which makes it extra complicated… I think the system is well designed." As to whether the system will survive in the aftermath of the NSA revelations, Schneier thinks the jury is still out: "That, we don't know."Back in the ceremony room, the four keyholders are once again locked in a cage with the safes holding their smartcards, this time returning them for future use. It is 23.32 on the clock and each is solemnly holding up their keycard, in a new tamper-evident bag, for the cameras to witness before returning it to the safe. Not everyone present is entirely gripped. "It's like a combination of church and a&nbsp;baseball game and I don't know what else," says Icann PR Lynn Lipinski. "I'm getting sleepy."At 00.06, five hours after we all arrived, it's time to shut off the live-streaming cameras. Lamb checks in to see how many people have been following the ceremony.The system admin calls back: "We peaked at 12."We file out, job done."Wait," Okubo says. "One question before we go… Can I ask who's coming for dinner?"There's a show of hands and, with the web secure for another three months, the keyholders to the internet file out into the LA sunshine.•Watch a film about the Icann keyholder ceremony attheguardian.com/video• This article was edited on 28 February 2014. The original said El Segundo was in northern Los Angeles, rather than the south-west of the city. This has been corrected.
In 2006, the film-maker James Rolfe uploaded a YouTube video of The Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN): a foul-mouthed, beer-drinking and furious retro gamer hell-bent on underlining just how bad some video game releases were in the 70s, 80s and 90s.A nostalgic match was lit in the hearts of millions of viewers, igniting a love within them for remembering terrible games and wasted childhood weekends.Eight years after AVGN’s original upload, the series and Rolfe’s film production company Cinemassacre have amassed tens of millions of views, a video game and an upcoming full-length feature film.“It’s like stand-up comedy. People laugh because it’s true… everyone tells me I say the same exact things they’ve been thinking in the back of their heads about all these old games,” says Rolfe.It’s not just older gamers reminiscing, however. “Many young people love my videos who may not have even been born when these games came out,” he says, noting that they are more used to games with bigger budgets than Hollywood blockbusters, and high-definition graphics to match. “Somehow they still relate to it and they like learning of the past.”Mike Matei, a close friend of Rolfe’s who appears in many of his videos, was the first to see AVGN’s potential. “When James showed me [AVGN] I realised the potential it had as a series… I uploaded them on to YouTube and it seems many people felt the same way I did.”AVGN went viral after Craig Skistimas began posting the videos on his videogame website ScrewAttack: “In 2006 after I saw some of his videos on this new site called YouTube. The two videos he had on there had about 2,000 views a piece and I couldn’t understand why, because I thought they were hilarious.”Almost all of the work that goes into each AVGN episode is done exclusively by Rolfe. AVGN episode #100, Rob the Robot, is one that Rolfe is proud of. Taking over 122 hours to complete, the video is testament to Rolfe’s unwavering dedication.This year’s impending Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie was almost entirely fan-funded, generating $325,000 in donations, and has been a huge project for Rolfe.“It’s been almost two years since the cameras first rolled on it and we finally got our last shot in December. I’ve been spending all day, every day, communicating with more than 30 artists who are working on the visual effects shots. Working with so many people at the same time can make your head spin… it’s a long process. Longer than I could have ever imagined.”Ranting about terrible games is only a tiny portion of Rolfe’s film-making repertoire, which contains hundreds of films and documentaries. One of Rolfe’s most touching films, The Dragon In My Dreams, is a self-analysis of why he began making movies and what drives him to create new pieces.Interested in film-making at a young age, Rolfe learned the craft a world away from digital media. “As a kid I was the only person I knew who made movies. I’m glad YouTube didn’t exist then because I would have posted up everything that I made, even if it was terrible. I would have probably wasted a lot of time reading negative comments and getting discouraged. I’m glad that I was able to make films all alone… it was practice for a future career. When YouTube came, I was ready for it.”Rolfe’s magic as a film-maker stems from his use of low-fi special effects to create end products that feel organic and genuine. One of his own favourite original films, The Deader the Better, is a horror-noir homage reminiscent of one of Rolfe’s biggest influences, George Romero.Rolfe is proof of the power that digital media can have in attracting niche communities and transforming them into huge global audiences.

Twitch Plays Pokémon, the online attempt to crowdsource an entire game of Pokémon Red, inspires some strong emotions.Scrolling through the chat feed, a viewer mostly sees thousands upon thousands of commands, as users type in the next button they want the game to press: “a”, “b”, “up”, “down”, “left”, “right” or the dreaded “start”, which causes the game to pause and everyone to shout at you.But mixed in with the stream of commands, which moves almost too fast to read, are other impassioned comments. Some just offer advice (“Go to Seafoam, there are trainers”), while others buy into the mythology of the game, calling to the deities the players have invented for guidance (“Praise our holy Helix!”).Those gods – the holy Helix fossil, Bird Jesus, Flareon the false prophet – are half in-jokes and half massively multiplayer attempts to instil reason to the actions of the onscreen character. Each of them has their own back story: the Helix fossil is a useless item which somehow found its way to the top of the player’s item list, causing them to repeatedly attempt to use it in the heat of battle. That was interpreted as “turning to the Helix fossil for guidance”.And where you have religion, you also have religious art.Choral musicPraise The Helix by Church of the Helix ChoirA Twitch Plays Pokémon hymnThe Church of the Helix Choir only has one hymn, but that’s impressive enough for a fake religion which has only been around for two weeks.The first verse, “Praise thee oh blessed Helix/who doth guide me past the ledge/and giveth holy bird to guide us/with gust and sand-attack,” refers back to one of the most scarring moments in the games history: “The Ledge”. A short walk between two points, it’s not even an obstacle for a normal player. But if the down button is pressed at any point, they have to start the walk again. It took seven hours to get past it.If the song sells enough copies, the choir plans to record further songs, eventually leading up to a whole album of music chronicling “the biggest events and lore in the TPP universe”.Historical ArtefactsOrigin myths, by redditorwhoaconstrictorRedditorwhoaconstrictormade this fan art,A Most Sacred Tablet, depicting all the events of the game up to the victory over the fourth of eight gym leaders.Depictions include Red, the player character, being given the Helix Fossil by Bird Jesus; the three moonstones and four gold nuggets which the players threw away rather than use; The Ledge; and, gazing over it all, the Omanyte which was born out of the Helix Fossil.(It also shows the many Pokémon the player had collected at this point.

In Spike Jonze’s new movie Her, Joaquin Phoenix is an introverted writer on the verge of divorce who falls in love with his computer’s intelligent operating system. Exactly how far-fetched or credible you think that is probably depends on how invested you are in technology. It was after all, inspired by the real-life web applicationCleverbot, which lets visitors engage in conversations with an AI program; and in a lot of ways the movie is a study of our growing reliance on devices as mediators in our social lives and love affairs. From Siri to Tinder, our smartphones and tablets are simultaneously humansing themselves while mechanising our relationships with other humans. How long before we fall for the devices themselves?Really though, this is already happening in video games, where non-player characters are becoming ever more complex, both in terms of visual representation and “intelligence”. In narrative adventures like Mass Effect and The Walking Dead, players stay with the same characters over the course of several games, communicating with them through simple conversation trees and trying to keep them safe through endless dangerous encounters with aliens and zombies. Mass Effect even allows players to form sexual relationships with other characters, which can have a profound impact on the gaming experience – even if the sense of reciprocity is minimal. In Mass Effect, the love affairs are story functions and the AI characters merely pawns in a set of narrative possibilities. They don’t love you back. Not really.But what if they could? In some ways this is more likely than the scenario envisaged in Her. Unlike operating systems, which are the practical interface between us and the computer, video games provide a playful environment in which we’re invited to identify with the onscreen avatars and events. Just as literature has done for hundreds of years, games invite us to identify with characters, they function to make us feel. It may be just a matter of time before a clever game designer uses cutting edge AI routines to simulate emotion. We know that basic speech recognition and conversational abilities are already possible, but can these be extended from chatbot programs into sophisticated game characters?Will we see AIs capable of falling for players?An intelligent questionThe first challenge here is in defining the “intelligence” part of artificial intelligence. Although huge advances have been made in academic AI research involving elements such as affective computing and machine perception, in video games the concept is still mostly confined to navigating the game world and responding to basic player actions. An AI character in an action game will be able to find a route through the environment, and will be able to hear and see the player-character, responding with a series of set actions. But they’re little more than marionettes or remote-controlled robots that have been given basic motor functions.The next step perhaps is to go from spatial to emotional pathfinding. “One thing that’s really important in social interaction is being able to think about what someone else might be thinking – it’s how we learn and plan things,” says Michael Cook, a researcher at Imperial College who has built an AI that can design its own games. “When you’re designing AI, you mostly focus on the end result, what a character actually does and whether that’s intelligent. But for us to relate to characters, we might need to make AI mimic the thought processes we go through as well. The way an AI plans to walk across a room in an FPS game is completely different to how you or I plan the same route. I think thought processes are a really interesting area for AI generally, since making believable mistakes and being outwitted in games also need this kind of work to be done.”For love, there has to be true adaptive intelligence. The main problem is that we’re not sure what that means. “True intelligence is a big phrase that hides a multitude of sins,” says Cook. “Is my dog truly intelligent? It can definitely do things that many video game characters can’t – it can learn actions, it can connect sounds to meanings, it can make friends with people and remember them – but it’s not the kind of intelligence we want from game characters. I think we’re getting closer to a new generation of game character, but the hard problems remain hard, and one of the biggest in terms of relationships with avatars is communication and language. We’re a long, long way off having natural conversations with characters that don’t slip right into the uncanny valley.”The problem is that we don’t actually know about a lot of the stuff we’d need to simulate in order to make a game character who could fall in love with the player. ”When we talk about going beyond AI that can win the game, we get into really murky territory of how much we actually understand the human condition,” says AI researcher and game developer Luke Dicken. “I think that we’re both quite close and also a long way away from this kind of NPC in games.“From the code or computer science point of view, it’s a horsepower problem now and that’s just going to get solved over time either by streamlining techniques or extra muscle in PCs, so we’re close-ish in some ways. On the other hand, from a behavioural science point of view, we don’t understand words like ‘intelligent’, ‘characterful’ or ‘deep personality’ and what that truly means in a deep connectionist kind of way – we know it when we see it, but that’s not necessarily enough to reliably construct something, and when we miss, we miss by a long way.”Mind the gapBut the thing about games is, players are more likely to fill in the gaps themselves. With a ‘thinking’ operating system, we’re starting with a dispassionate productivity application; an operating system is designed to be useful not loveable and it exists as a functional system. But in games, there’s often a narrative, there’s a script and there is playful interaction – games like Mass Effect provide an environment in which we want to establish relationships with characters – we naturally humanise the experience, because, look, there are people on the screen and they’re doing interesting stuff. Games usually have very simple stories and very broad characteristations, but because we’re invested in the experience we imprint emotional depth on to the framework. So surely the task of generating a convincing, attractive AI is a little more simple for game makers than OS designers?“Characters can generate really strong emotive feelings in us already,” says Dicken. “Telltale Games do this really well – you want to protect Clementine and I definitely fell a bit in love with Snow White in The Wolf Among Us Episode 1. Right now though, I think a lot of that emotive nature is stemming from putting ourselves in the role of the player character. Crystal Dynamics infamously talked about trying to make the player feel protective of Lara Croft in the latest Tomb Raider and I think that’s a mistake not only because of the gender issues it raises, but because their job is to make the player be Lara. Did I fall a bit in love with Snow White, or did my version of the player character, Bigby Wolf? It’s a blurry line there.“But stepping back from games a little and looking at something like Lionhead’s Project Milo, this was a kid that you could play with, he had toys and a personality and was super expressive. We’re still talking about virtual characters, but in this setting you as yourself get to interact with the character - this is a stark contrast from most games which are still about ‘role-playing’. This puts a divide between the player’s emotions and the game world, so I think an emotional attachment really needs to stem from ourselves not from our perception of the character’s self.”The social sceneSo let’s assume that we begin to see a new era of games in which gamers are invited to play as themselves, and to establish unmoderated relationships with AI characters. What then? “One big step forward I can see on the horizon is subtle social interaction,” says Cook. “The Impulsion Project, which I saw at AIIDE in 2012, blew my mind. This kind of stuff in games would go a long way to boosting the perceived intelligence of NPCs.” The Impulsion project is a social intelligence engine developed by Claudio Pedica at Reykjavik University’s AI lab. It seeks to generate lifelike interactive characters who understand their surroundings and can grasp the meaning of player interactions. Pedica has worked with Icelandic game developer CCP to explore the possibility of implanting his tech into future titles. And once you have AI characters who know where they are, what they are doing and what the player wants, we’re getting toward relationships.Closer, but not quite there – games have to start to think about non-player characters in a different way; not as functional automatons in a narrative sequence, but as functioning beings that will generate a range of responses to the gamer - because range is important. “One of the real things here is how we interact with stuff,” says Dicken. “In general, people can’t make meaningful attachments to things that they can only interact with in very limited ways. That’s why natural language processing is so important, so that the character can understand what we are saying and that has symbolic meaning to them. Right now our complex romantic interactions in a lot of games boils down to ‘Press X to sexytime’ and a few canned pieces of dialogue and for some people maybe that’s enough, but it’s not what most people would consider sufficient for a meaningful relationship.”Perhaps the most interesting element in all of this is the idea of reciprocity. In the movie Her, the AI operating system responds to the lead character and their relationship is mutual – there is a sense of shared enjoyment. Can a computer appreciate conversation? Can it get jokes?Analysing the likelihood of this scenerio recently, Gartner researcher, Jackie Fenn, wrote: “Humour and creativity will be among the more challenging areas for artificial intelligence, but even here researchers are experimenting with clever algorithms and deep learning. If a computer can learn what makes people laugh – and more importantly what makesyoulaugh – based on watching and analysing over time, there is no theoretical reason that a computer couldn’t eventually display and respond to humour. Similarly with music or art – by experimenting, analysing and learning, it could figure out which compositions create the best emotional resonance in the human brain.”Dicken, however, is unsure of how much reciprocity could be implemented into a game system. “I think it’s a really thorny notion,” he says. “If a character is programmed to love the player, can that ever truly be reciprocal since it’s also effectively non-consensual? If you’re programmed with the capacity to love and you use that capacity, is that true reciprocity or has the player ’gamed the system’ to cause it to happen? It’s really interesting the asymmetry it introduces in that the participants are less on an equal footing than in a traditional relationship because a virtual character will always be constrained by their programming. You could maybe argue that the same is true for humans - although that opens a whole other philosophical avenue - but two humans are equally unknowable and complex to each other.”Learning and doingIn academic AI research, we are seeing learning systems that can begin to draw emergent conclusions.Google’s own search toolsare using machine learning and re-enforcement learning techniques to make the system more pro-active and usefully predictive. The company’s head of research, Alfred Spector, talks about combining neural networks with user feedback and natural language parsing to create a system that effectively simulates intelligence.Indeed, in games we’re already seeing interesting users of networked systems – or cloud-based computing - to learn player behaviours. The driving game Forza Motorsport 5 studies the behaviour of individual players, and then creates a Drivatar, which mimics and represents them online. Could similar systems be used to gather behavioural and conversational data from thousands of gamers to construct more authentic AI characters? Could the cloud become a sort of neural network? We have seen something sort of like this with the MIT Media Lab’s projectThe Restaurant, which combines the experiences of thousands of participants to re-model social behaviours in the virtual space and create a new game.Certainly, the ability to remotely save elements of gameplay opens up the possibility of more sustained relationships with characters. If data is stored online, the player’s relationships can be stored too, from one game to the next. In 2012 game designer and author Jessie Schell gave a talk at the Game developers’ Conference in San Francisco about game characters and how they are evolving.“One of the biggest changes we’re going to see over the coming 10 years is our relationship with virtual characters,” he says. “I think they are going to start to become more intelligent, they are going to talk to you – because voice recognition is coming – and what I argue is they’re going to become something I call virtual companions - the idea being that the characters will have a sort of cloud-based memory of everything they’ve ever done with you and they’ll remember from game to game. I mean, it drives me nuts right now; I’ll load up the new Mario game, and he’s all ‘It’s a-me, Mario, what’s your name?’, and I’m like, ‘Mario, we’ve been playing games together for 20 years - are you kidding me? Do you really not remember?!’ But I think he is going to start to remember - characters will know they have relationships with us.”For Cook, the question is more about motivation than capability. Why should a developer worry about making characters that we can fall in love with and that love us back and remember us? “I’m not sure what kind of game would make the best use of this, actually. Perhaps one with strong companions – Glados from Portal would be an excellent character to develop a relationship with over many games, or a game with characters that can learn things. If the Torchlight pets remembered you between games and learned tricks, that would be a phenomenal sell for me! Actually, animals might not be a bad place to start when exploring love and intelligent NPCs. After all, we love our pets almost as much as we love other humans, and you don’t have to spend thousands of dollars working out how to get a pet to speak to the player, either.”The big changeOne thing is certain, developers are already making the shift from love affairs that exist only within the enclosed narrative of a game, toward sentient game characters that form their own relationships. Love isn’t just something that comes from a script, it is coming from game systems; it is emergent. We see this to some extent in Redshirt, the fascinating Facebook parody game from Tiniest Shark which Dicken wrote the AI for. Here, the whole game is experienced through a social network interface (SpaceBook) and ou actions create friendships and rivalries that shape the action. Very quickly, players begin to humanise the other inhabitants of the world and deeper motivations are invented.Elsewhere, Maxis, the creator of the Sims series of life simulations is expanding the AI and emotional responses of the characters for Sims 4, finely tuning them to what the player does. And Second Life developer Linden Lab recently ran a gaming experiment named Versu, a sort of choose-you-own-adventure ebook in which reader actions combined with AI characters to modify the story. It was also fascinating how many Halo players fell head-over-heels in love with Cortana, the lead character’s AI guide and assistant. In some ways the emerging ‘love affair’ between this synthetic being and the game’s hero Master Chief is a sort of simulcrum of where we’re going with human/character interactions – it was a machine relationship played out within a simulation.Emotional story-telling is of growing importance in the games industry. Years ago, plots were basically about getting the girl and saving the planet, but with a much more diverse and mature audience, studios are having to be smarter. Games like Gone Home, The Last of Us and The Walking Dead are as much to do with emotion as they are with action and combat – so it seems logical that the next step will be finding a way to strengthen our relationships with the people onscreen, even if they are controlled by computers.For Dicken it’s about developers changing the way they think about making non-player characters, it’s about providing AIs with the capability of interpreting the script. “We’re at some point going to reach a point where characters in games are much more like actors,“ he says. “Rather than having to get down and dirty writing code and hacking in hardcoded solutions to specific problems, game development becomes much more similar to being a film director where you’re instructing actors on their motivation and tone. The last five years of my life have pretty much been about taking the first steps down this path, and I really hope I get to continue that.”Faking feelingsSo the best we can hope for from game characters is better actors? We can’t provide them with a simulation of the emotional process – just the ability to fake it? “I think it’s inevitable that we’re going to get better at creating more lifelike and real characters and I think that over time, some sort of virtual companion could easily become a thing,” says Dicken. “Many long distance relationships could already be taken over by an AI system that talked to you on Facebook and played a game like World of Warcraft with you. I think that its going to end up more of a service and a virtual pet than a true partnership though, because there are inherent limitations that would prevent an equal partnership. I don’t know - we’re easily 20 years from being close to having to worry about this. More probably.”I don’t know. I think people fundamentally want to connect – and we will conveniently detach ourselves from the aspects of reality that prevent this from happening. From teenage crushes to stalking, we develop patterns of thought and behaviour that facilitate our needs, even when those needs aren’t adequately reciprocated. So if a game character were to make even the tiniest gestures toward recognition and romance, players will close the gap. Of course, most of us don’t actually want an actual relationship with a virtual being – we’re not all in Spike Jonze movies. But we wouldn’t an emotionally resonant narrative game be more compelling if it felt like there was a true connection? It would be something utterly unique to games.“I don’t think we’ll ever have true reciprocation from AI,” says Cook. “They lack a lot of important qualities that make something like love possible - emotions, mortality, a culture that has a concept of love in it. But the thing about love is that it doesn’t need to be two-way. People have always fallen in love with video game characters, and they’ll continue to do so, and characters will get better at learning, at responding, and at seeming to reciprocate. In the movie Her, we never really know whether any of what the AI says is true or not, from start to finish. But that doesn’t stop the movie’s protagonist from falling in love. As long as the illusion is there, we’ll find a way - and game developers have been honing the art of illusion for decades.”Human perception is a network of assumptions, automatic behaviours and subjective distortions; we are easily manipulated by our desires. “Thou blind fool, Love, ” Shakespeare wrote. “What dost thou to mine eyes/ That they behold, and see not what they see?” Give a game character a few good lines and a nice smile and I think we can do the rest. We are programmed to do the rest.• Are the robots about to rise?Google’s new director of engineering thinks so…

"We never made an offer to acquire them.

Reports surfaced just over a year ago describing talks between Google and WhatsApp over a possible acquisition, but WhatsApp was quick to deny any such talks.10 amazingly stupid things the 'experts' will try to tell you about Microsoft &gt;&gt; ZDNetEd Bott has a bone or ten to pick.
