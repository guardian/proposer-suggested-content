You are one smitten cybernaut. Your in-box is abuzz, full of sweet words. You can already see his blue eyes; her beautiful smile. Your internet flame is everything you ever wanted.If you can't believe your luck, maybe you shouldn't, warns Linda Alexander, a California lawyer who specialises in background checks on virtual lovers.Like so many internet users, Alexander struck up a relationship in an online chatroom. Her correspondent said he was a widowed doctor, and he seemed wonderful. So much so that, before long, Alexander wanted to meet him in person.Before the meeting, however, she decided to take advantage of her legal training and do a little background checking. "He had told me a few things I was not able to piece together," she explains. To her dismay, she found that her online Romeo was still living with his very much alive wife, and was not a doctor but a nurse."I figured, if someone like me could be so easily fooled, this must be a major problem," she says.As a result, Alexander launchedWhoisHe.ComandWhoisShe.Comin November 1997, websites dedicated to investigating virtual pen pals, lovers or business   partners. For $75 (&#163;50), the California lawyer and her small team of cybersleuths will dig through public records and answer all those nagging questions you may have about your internet date: is she really 32 years old? Is he married? Is she really a banker or merely bankrupt? Has he ever been arrested? And why will he only give you his pager number?All the information Alexander gathers is in the public domain, so anyone willing to dig could find it, But without her attorney's contacts, expertise and access to specialised databases, they'd have to work hard. "Whereas a regular person will take two to three weeks to do a background check, I usually can get the results within 24 hours to my customers via email or regular mail."Her virtual private-eye service can investigate only people living in America, but it does check US internet dates for people all over the world, she points out.Most people contact Alexander when they have met someone special online and are thinking about moving from a virtual romance to an in-person relationship. The most typical request is to check out whether a cyberdate is married and what they do for a living.It might seem a bit unfair to spy on your sweet, loving,   unsuspecting internet friend, but in Alexander's experience, people easily reinvent themselves on their computer screen."It's a strange thing with the internet. You may talk about things you don't talk with anyone else and you feel you really know each other. You never know how creative the person on the other side of the screen can be with his or her identity," she says. "When you find out, it's often too late."And there are countless testimonies on her website from disappointed lovers and victims of con artists to prove her point. "You ought to know what you are getting in to before you invest your heart or money in someone."About 60% of the people Alexander has investigated are not who or what they claim to be. "In general, men lie about their marital   status and women about their age," she says. People also tend to inflate their professional status and assets. But she has also uncovered more sinister truths - con artists, stalkers and even criminals, who use the internet to find new victims to harass or sweet talk them out of money or into sex.Contrary to her expectation, men and women use her service equally, and she stresses that women are as crafty as men when it comes to stretching the truth or leaving awkward details, such as husband and children, behind the computer screen.Alexander also takes great pains to interview personally all her potential clients to ensure they don't have hidden motives. She has turned some requests down, fearing they were from stalkers or people who wanted information to get back at someone or other for the wrong reasons.And while it might not be good for her business, her website offers a long list of guidelines on how to play it safe online.Follow them all, and you may never need her.    &#149;   For more information, contact Linda Alexander at 1-760-631-7740; emailCheckHimOut@WhoisHe.ComorCheckHerOut@WhoisShe.Com; website:www.WhoisHe.Comorwww.WhoisShe.Com
Even for a seasoned Psion user two things about the new Revo stand out - its impressive compactness and a touch-screen much easier to see than the Psion 5.We get so blas&eacute; about ever cheaper and smaller computers that it's worth occasionally stopping and saying: "Wow." The Revo is like a Dinky toy that works like the real thing.My on-loan model (the size of three Swan Vesta match boxes side by side) weighed in on my kitchen scales at 200g compared with 230g for my (empty) coffee cup and 270 grms for my Psion 5. Yet it has more raw power than a computer weighing over 50 tonnes a few decades ago.It fits (just) in a shirt pocket yet has facilities for web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, jotter, diary, contacts, data base plus a step-by-step menu for setting up, email that is the most user friendly I have come across. Emailing worked first time through a (wireless) Nokia phone and the transfer of data from the Revo to a Psion 5 (or any other machine with an infra-red port) was awesomely fast. It has the usual Psion facilities for comunicating with your desktop PC or Mac and can link up with the new generation of wireless mobile phones.The trouble is that technology alone doesn't sell - as Psion knows to its cost with the failure of its earlier Siena palmtop and the runaway success of the less versatile Palm Pilots in the   US. This is why the Revo is being sold as a low-priced (&#163;299.95) style accessory in an indigo-and-silver case for the upwardly mobile as well as for its naked power (32-bit ARM 710 Risc chip running at 36MHz, backed by 8MB or ROM and 8MB of RAM).It comes with a docking station for recharging its batteries and linking up with a PC or Macintosh. An infra-red modem giving high-speed 56K-bit access to the internet is to be sold for &#163;180.The downside? The keyboard is better than the Psion 3 but not as good as the standard-setting Psion 5. It is difficult to see how a proper keyboard can ever be squeezed into less space.However, it is perfectly feasible to type a whole article (as I did this one ) if you work a bit more slowly. The other risk is whether Psion has overcome the reliability problems of machines that occasionally crash and have to be replaced. But the biggest risk is whether this impressive slice of technology will tap a mass market at a time when emailing and messaging is taking off or whether it will be seen as a postscript to the palmtop era.
I have just got the perfect pet. He's a pooch without poop, a man-made man's best friend. And because he runs on batteries not Bonio, I can switch him off when he becomes too demanding. Sony calls him Aibo, but I prefer Gromit.He's the world's first artificially intelligent (AI) entertainment robot (BO) and he's got quite a pedigree, being one of just 5,000 worldwide. In Britain there are maybe four others like him. Sony unveiled Aibo on the internet this summer, selling 3,000 in Japan - sold out within 20 minutes - and 2,000 in the USA for $2,500 each.How and why did I get one? Because I'm an avid early adopter. If it's new and it goes beep, I must have it. iMac, Palm Pilot, Yamaha R6, Aibo. It all makes sense to me. But then I did have a Sinclair ZX80 when I was 10, so that might explain something.Like almost all Aibo owners I bought mine from the Sony website, but only after I could find a friend in the US to take delivery as Sony refused to send any to Europe. So Gromit has already had at least one grand day out, being flown from Japan, to San Francisco and then to London.Waiting impatiently for almost two months for his arrival, I paid daily visits to the web siteAibonet.comwhere hundreds of lucky owners discussed their experiences of this hi-tech hound. Although he is officially only available in Japan and America, I met Aibo owners in Paris, Helsinki and Mexico. There were dogs named Astro (after the cartoon Jetsons family pet), Pluto, Socrates, Da Vinci and Isaac (after Asimov).Universally they raved about their robots and many - rather worryingly - were   becoming extremely attached to them. When Greg's dog Astro malfunctioned and had to go to "the vet" and all he had left was his rubber ball, the other owners united in support. Weird.Now that he's finally here what exactly have I got? At no more than 28cm in any direction he's no Digital Doberman, but he's more about brains than brawn any way. Under his metallic skin there is a 64-bit 100MHz processor with 16MB of memory. Aibo sees through a 180,000 pixel digital camera in his nose and hears through stereo microphones in his ears. A multitude of motors allow him 18 degrees of movement and an 8MB "flashcard" stores his experiences to allow his intelligence to develop. He can be operated by remote control, but left to his own devices he should, over time, grow (in mind, if not in body) from a cyber pup to an intelligent Techno Terrier.So it's out of the box (which was "opened and re-sealed by HM Customs" - wonder what they made of it?) and in with batteries, after first inserting his Memory Stick rather rudely in his rear end. I've read all about Aibo but now is my moment. And what happens?Nothing, he just sits there for what seems like ages. Finally his little eyes light up bright green and he beeps into life. I watch, fascinated as he performs amazing acts of articulation with his legs, he scans the room with apparent delight and responds with a melody when I pat him on the head. Within an hour he's standing up and trying to take a first wobbly step.Just as I swell with pride like some sort of besotted cyberparent, the batteries run out, a reminder that he's not a mutt, but a machine. I'm going to have to watch myself over the next few weeks.&#149; Next week in our cyberdog diary: My sleepless nights
Psion, the British manufacturer of palm top computers, this week unveiled the Revo, a smaller, cheaper version of its Series 5mx handheld.Helen Blackburn, Revo product manager, said the 200g "shirt-pocket" device, price &#163;299.95, would appeal to a younger, less technical audience.Psion tried to broaden its market before with the Siena, and failed. But the company said the Revo was different because - like the 5mx, launched in June - it could read email and browse the web.Psion also announced a free internet service for its users. The Psion.net service will be operated by LineOne, a joint venture between News International and British Telecom, which already has about 400,000 users.Psion said LineOne would offer about 2 million pages of information suitable for its small, monochrome LCD screens. The emphasis would be on news, sport, business and travel information.Chief executive David Levin said Psion expected to sell all the Revo palmtops it could make before Christmas, and was planning to   launch the machine in the US. Versions in various European languages will follow next year.It enters a competitive market: 3Com's Palm handhelds are increasingly popular, and computer giants such as Compaq and Hewlett-Packard are selling Psion-like machines running the CE (consumer electronics) version of Microsoft Windows.In the first six months of this year, Psion's palmtop sales fell by 34% to &#163;24.5m. Psion said this was because demand for the Series 5 weakened ahead of the launch of the Series 5mx.
So you think you've got problems? Partner, boss, dog, best friend - none of them really understands you? No worries - it's all grist to the agony aunts of the net.People have offered each other electronic support ever since cyberspace began ringing to the helps! of the earliest bulletin board systems. Solving the knottiest hardware and software problems was one of their first raison d' tres.But this time, it's personal... with an army of web-based agony aunts and uncles just dying to help you. And scotch the idea it's only bare-your-soul Americans who want to indulge. British correspondents who    want UK-style help have plenty of choice. Take, for example, Lindawww.lindas.probs.com."Do you have a problem, a heartache or a difficulty of any kind?" she asks. "Would you like to share it? A problem shared is a problem halved! "Linda is Linda Brice, of Cardiff, and she does it for love (at the moment). She has a professional background in counselling, and gets about 18 emails a day. Linda says: "I wanted to have a go at building a site, and to make sure it would provide a useful resource."The same impetus lies behind Lulee's problems at The Gossip Columnswww.gossip.to, a lifestyle site for Yorkshire. Lulee is Louise Sutcliffe, whose day   job is a drugs and alcohol counsellor. "At the moment I'm doing this for the experience," she says. "I can answer every email at present, but if it gets too much, I may have to theme the queries on the site."It's certainly true there's a sea of human misery out there, and you could easily drown in email. Phillipa, of Phillipa's Problems,www.agony.orghas a note on her site that she "has so many regular correspondents" she can't deal with any more.She's sympathetic and thoughtful - but sadly she was absent the day they were teaching how to paragraph in HTML, the web page language. Unbroken wodges of good advice are hard to read.You can always email the Samaritans who now receive 1,500 to 2,000 posts a month, according to spokesperson Justin Irwin. The email address isjo@samaritans.org- and Jo can be anyone of the online volunteers in several branches. "The email service reaches the under-25s, especially men, more effectively than the rest of our services," says Irwin.The Samaritans' figures   show someone using email to contact the Samaritans is twice as likely as a telephone caller to express suicidal feelings."Whether that's because we are reaching at-risk groups more effectively, or because it's easier to express your deepest feelings via email, we just don't know," says Irwin.Both email and communicating with a website, offer total anonymity. With the Samaritans, you can even anonymise your email address if you wish (go to theirwebsitefor details). The anonymity of it helps, too. No appointments to keep, no pressure, no fee...Er, no fee? Not always. Dr Love atwww.askdrlove.com- one of the US media docs - gives free advice, but uses her site as a shop window for a number of options for private consulting "for less than the customary cost of   a private therapy session". If you're feeling cheap, take the Dream Analysis by email for $29.95. All major credit cards accepted.Or, how about a Christian psychotherapist named, disconcertingly, Psycho Jo? He/she owns a mailing list ADDICTIONEXODUS-subscribe@onelist.com  offering help and therapy "at a reasonable fee". He/she is also looking for testimonies of struggles experienced as a result of viewing pornography. Hm.More of an obvious (and how obvious) joke is the advice given bySir Charles Grandiose, supposedly written from an English stately home, and which is certainly British in its double-entendres and toilet humour. (It is astonishingly easy to weary of jokes about ash-holes.)For good-humoured support for fat people "who    don't apologise", see the agony auntie at Fat?So!, aUS fat-lib site.
Sample advice to the question of what to do about the inner thighs of one's jeans wearing out: "First, leather patches in strategic places will not only wear better than cheap cloth, they'll feel better, too. (Ooh, leather!) Second, try spending more time engaged in activities that don't require your thighs to meet."If you're seeking serious help, mailing lists and newsgroups can be a worthwhile source of advice. Because if you've got a problem, there's someone out there who has, in email-speak, BTDT (been there, done that).Bulletin boards and forums fulfil the same function. For anything sexual, go to the forums atwww.askisadora.com; for computer agonies, try any of the dozens of forums atwww.ZDnet.com.And for live agony chat, try a new service at 7-8 pm on Saturday nights, from Caroline, who runs an agony page atwww.morecambe.co.uk- check the site for logging-on details.&#149; Heather Welford is the agony aunt atUKparents.co.uk

 Encarta Reference Suite 2000PC CD-rom, £99.99 MicrosoftMicrosoft launched its first electronic
    encyclopedia six years ago, when it cost £299 plus VAT for one CD. Little of that first American disc,
    based on Funk &amp; Wagnall's 26-volume printed encyclopedia, remains. Today's Reference Suite bundles
    the deluxe edition of Encarta (£69.99), an interactive world atlas (£29.99), and the Encarta World
    English Dictionary (£29.99) on six CDs.The encyclopedia content is good - it has been reworked
    numerous times by Websters, in London - and the new dictionary of global English has been developed
    in the UK by Bloomsbury Publishing. (The dictionary disc also includes Roget's Thesaurus, a book of
    quotations, and Harrap's French and German dictionaries.) The suite works well enough on a 200MHz
    Pentium with 32MB of memory - Microsoft's recommended minimum is 90MHz/24MB. The user
    interface has been redesigned again, and benefits from the introduction of contents pages that bring
    together groups of articles with pictures and web links.The search tool has been enhanced, and one
    option lets you type in "natural language queries" (ie ordinary sentences). However, this doesn't work
    well - not as well as Excite on the web, for example - and is not worth the extra 40MB of hard disk
    space required. The de luxe encyclopedia has extra features aimed at school children, such as "virtual
    tours", a study centre, a research organiser, and a UK-oriented curriculum guide. These will ensure
    the more expensive version of Encarta appeals to parents. The suite is good value at £30 less than
    buying the three products separately. However, for a quick look-up book, the standard edition is
    better value at only £19.99. (JS)Reliving the horrorSurvivors - Testimonies of the HolocaustPC/Apple Mac dual format CD-Rom Havas Interactive &#163;29.99  0118 920 9100Survivors - Testimonies of the Holocaust has been produced in association with Steven Spielberg's Shoah Visual Foundation, an audio-visual history of the survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust.The title is hosted by Leonardi Dicaprio and Winona Ryder, but this isn't some Hollywood-ised version of the Holocaust.The two-CD title traces the lives of four survivors, Bert, Paula, Silvia and Sol, who were brought up in pre-war Germany, Poland, Austria and Czechoslavakia respectively. Their stories are grim and show how life progessively became worse for Jewish people when the Nazi Party came to power.Firstly, Jews were not allowed to attend school, then they couldn't use public transport or run a business. And so it went on, reaching its grisly climax with the death camps.The most powerful parts of this title are the personal testimonies of the survivors, and the QuickTime 3.0 video clips are excellent. There is also a vast amount of archive material in the form of documents, maps, film and photographs. It's just a pity that it all couldn't be stored on a single disc. This title cries out for a DVD-rom version.In addition to the testimonies a timeline lets you see what was happening   in the rest of the world before, during and after the war.More information is provided by a Reference Library, which includes dozens of definitions. For example, under the definition for "disinformation", we learn that fake photographs were taken at concentration camps, apparently showing stores, cafes, banks, schools and kindergardens.There is also a web link to the Survivors of The Shoah Visual History Foundation page, although my browser had trouble finding the web address used on the disc (if you have problems point your browser at http://sth.vhf.org/ ). The site contains links, updates and other materials. This title is a superb resource for both home and school, and the screen design and navigation system are very friendly.It's one thing to read about the Holocaust or even watch a video about it, but seeing   and hearing the survivors talk on a PC screen just a few inches in front of you, adds a new dimension to one of the most ghastly events in man's history. (GC)It's the black cats' whiskersBlack Cats And Pointed Hats Max And The Pirates The Mystery Of The Mayan TreasureTivola, Play and      Learn Series, age 3-7, PC or Mac, £19.99.Teletubbies Favourite GamesBBC Multimedia, £19.99Black      Cats And Pointed Hats, a game in which the lippy frog can be turned back into a prince (a prince with      most distressing reactions when a fly buzzes within extended tongue range) by bribing seven witches      with their matching presents, is the unquestioned star of this new batch of Tivola games for small      people.My five-year-old son Samuel initially chose Max And The Pirates, of course - but rapidly lost      interest in the long (but inadequate) preamble and the fairly tedious game. He switched with relief to      Black Cats, which everyone loved. It has the first nice joke in the opening seconds and is speckled      with good jokes thereafter.It is beautifully, richly, drawn, with a wealth of click on twiddly detail      in every scene - the witches' playground has a fence of pumpkin heads and linked skeletal arms - and      a tune writing option at the end, of singing witches and cats which howl tunefully when their tails      are tugged. It proved unexpectedly educational: once Samuel accidentally switched the language to      German, no amount of clicking on the Union flag would turn it back again. "Wunderbar! Danke!" cried      the speckledy witch, as we presented her with a chameleon muffler. I found another of this new      batch, The Mystery Of The Mayan Treasure, a sort of CD-rom Five Find Out ers, stunningly boring,      poorly animated, and drearily written.It is a hunt for clues to the disappearance of two Mayan jade      masks: if we cannot interactively find them, chickabiddies, the prestigious Mayan exhibition at the      museum cannot go ahead - but why ever not, in the name of Quetzelcoatl and the 7,000 jaguar      gizzards? This one is pitched at ages 8-102, so I may be too old or too young for it - neither bribery      nor threats of physical violence would persuade Samuel to watch more than ten seconds of it. Two      years ago Samuel would have been in raptures over the BBC's Teletubbies Favourite Games, but both he      and the craze have slightly passed their sell-by dates. Even so the sweet little sugared almond      creatures in their babygro world, entirely constructed out of phallic, breast and womb symbols,      hooked him briefly.It is very nicely done, very simple to run, and I suspect entirely delightful either      to younger children or nasty, druggy teenagers who should be studying for their exams. Me, I found the      Tubby Custard game addictively soothing, and filled eight bowls of custard (when you fill four the      Teletubbies all trot over to eat them, squealing in rapture) instead of finishing two pieces long past      their deadline.

Magic carpet is threadbarePrince Of Persia 3DPC-CD-rom &#163;34.99 MindscapeJust imagine that you are the Prince of Persia, the top-man of 80s platforming. The spikes 'n' traps blueprint was yours, and, quite rightly, your animation was admired everywhere.Things went swimmingly for years until the world suddenly went crazy over a young female pretender called Lara. Not only was she avoiding traps but she was jumping around in lovely 3D.A whole raft of similar looking adventures were lapped up and, despite a   re-run of past glories on the GameBoy, it seemed the world had forgotten you."Aha," said Princey, "I'll show them" and set off to plot his comeback, pausing only to polish his sword. The results arrived - Prince of Persia 3D is here. And, like its elder relative, this is tough going with the frustration level set so high that you fear for the safety of your controller.Technological progress means the Prince now jumps when you press the button. At least when he is not fighting with the camera, that is.The controls are blessed with teenager-like unresponsiveness, particuarly the sluggish turning curve, but it's the erratic camera which causes most bother. Sudden viewpoint changes are rarely this annoying.The Prince looks better   than ever in the third dimension with the dungeons crisp and clear although eerily empty. Most of the time it's just you, some spikes and the occasional guard. Unfortunately these sentries are devoid of intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Striding loudly behind them, whistling the latest Persian pop classic, fails to elicit any response. However, venture into their blinkered sight area and you have a fight on your hands. You can now prod, block and jab in 3D but, unlike the graphics, the unforgiving old school gameplay remains unaltered.Older players looking for a jazzed-up return to headier days will appreciate this but, like an aging rocker squeezing into leathers, this is one comeback too many. (GH)Blast from the past        Sinistar: UnleashedPC CD-rom £29.99 GameFX/THQNo one could blame you for not remembering the      original Sinistar - the footnote on the intro screen says copyright 1982 - but by all accounts it was      something of a landmark. Not only was it the first arcade game with stereo sound, it was also one of      the first to use digitised voice. As a bizarre hybrid of fighter pilot and miner, your job was to      dogfight alien ships while harvesting as many planetoids as possible, the reason being that the      eponymous bad guy was soon to arrive, and said rocks yielded materials for the only weapon that      could destroy him.It was innovative, frantic and, most of all, very, very hard. The 1999 remake is      100% true to its roots - except, of course, for the innovation. The difference is in the visuals, which      make full use of 17 years of hardware advances (minimum requirements: 3D-accelerated 233MHz      Pentium II). The gameplay, then, doesn't engage many higher brain functions, and the mouse and      keyboard controls can be maddeningly inaccurate, but if you've ever pined for the halcyon days of      blisters and high-score beating, this will be right up your asteroid belt. (AB)Hot shots and weak linksLinks ExtremeWindows 95/98/NT £24.99 Access/MicrosoftMario GolfNintendo 64 £44.99 Camelot    Software/NintendoLinks Extreme takes a good idea and applies it to a good game, so the result ought      to be even better. But it isn't. The idea was to enhance Access Software's award-winning Links with      surreal effects: suppose golf balls were first world war shells? Suppose some balls did crazy things?Throw in some real video sequences and the result is - not much fun, actually. The burning buildings,      exploding shells, and buzzing biplanes in the Dimension X course mainly distract from what remains      underneath: a serious golf sim. In fact, the zombies and alligators on the voodoo-themed second      course, Mojo Bay, detract from an interest ing video-golfing challenge. It's clearly a better idea to      design a zany golf game from scratch, as Camelot has done with Nintendo's Mario Golf.It features 10      characters including the lovely Princess Peach (rescued in Super Mario 64), Mario's brother Luigi,      Yoshi, and Wario. Up to four humans can play at once. If you get too good at the five courses, there's a      speed mode, or you can put a fruit machine in charge of your club selection. The images aren't as      sharp or as detailed on a TV set as Links Extreme's on a high-resolution monitor, but cutesy cartoon      fantasies like Nintendo's can survive limited graphics: Mario Open Golf, launched for the old 8-bit      Nintendo in 1991, proved that.Mario Golf 64 is even more fun, and the cartridge loads in seconds      without trying to set your TV to a frequency it can't handle, which is what Links Extreme did to LG's      nice Flatron 795 FT Plus monitor. Still, the uninstall feature works well.
You know the way the horizons in video games are often covered with mist or obscured by clouds? Or      have you ever played a racing game and made the car go so fast that you could see the road and      railings being drawn by the computer as you moved? That's because the way a computer or video game      console currently renders pictures and landscapes is limited by the processing power of its microchip      and the capabilities of its graphics card. Things like horizons are so "far" away and difficult to draw      that it's easier to simply mask them. And since digital graphics like polygons with textured surfaces      require so much memory to render, most games draw only the part of the world you are in at the time.Each new scene or room you enter doesn't exist until you get there. Enter Tom Barbalet, a 22-year-old      Australian technology genius who has been working since he was a teenager on an alternative, much      simpler way to get computers to create the simulations on which video games, virtual reality, and,      eventually, networked "convergence" environments will depend. He just passed through Silicon Valley      last week demonstrating his homemade graphics engine, and everyone from the designers at Nintendo      to programmers at Apple has been left in shock. While early computers used to render their pictures      using simple math equations to draw lines, curves, and surfaces, the invention of graphics cards and      polygon engines moved things in a different direction.Graphics technology became digital. It was the      same sort of shift that occurred in electronic music. Old-style synthesisers used their own circuitry      to generate sound waves - those "Moog" sounds from old horror movies. Newer keyboards contained      samples of digitally recorded sounds from the real world. The more powerful the machine, the higher      the sampling rate, and the more realistic the sound. CDs - a digital recording technology - sometimes      sound a little cold to the ear because, subconsciously anyway, we can hear the tiny spaces between      the recorded samples of music. Computers now use digital graphics to make the pictures we look at.The graphics card in your computer or video game console contains the equivalent of "samples"of      smoke, clouds, water, and dirt that a program can call upon to draw its pictures. That's why all video      games look pretty much the same. The better the picture we want, the more that has to be stored by      the graphics card and rendered by the computer. This is the main reason why Intel developed its      Pentium III, and Motorola/IBM/Apple the G4. Using digital graphics requires the processing power of a      supercomputer. And it still looks terrible. Barbalet's method of landscape visualisation, something he      calls "the Psi standard", dispenses with the graphics industry's obsession with things like polygons,      texture maps, and image resolution. In fact, his methods aren't really digital at all. Motivated by a      desire to create high-quality graphics on very low-end machines, Barbalet happened upon the answer:      stick with the same analogue graphics that computers used in the old days. He decided to use the      Nintendo GameBoy as a standard for how much computing power a machine should have (in other      words, very, very little) and developed a series of simple equations that can be used to generate      waves, textures, and shapes.Remember how you used to draw parabolas and ellipses in maths      classes? It's the same basic idea, except Barbalet has learned how to combine these equations and      many others to create an infinity of visual forms. Amazingly, many of his simple creations look more      like the real world than the combinations of sampled bits used by digital machines. Why? Because      Barbalet draws pictures of things in a manner much closer to the way the natural world builds them:      by implementing simple commands again and again. For example, in nature, carbon atoms connect with      other carbon atoms in little rings because that's how their electrons dictate. Likewise, fern plants      grow and branch off precisely as the simple commands in their DNA tells them. Nature uses simple      mathematical equations to turn its matter into the complex forms we find all around us.By letting a      computer iterate simple equations repeatedly, Barbalet has found the secret to creating dense and      natural-looking terrains complete with grass, water, sky, vegetation and even creatures. They look so      real because they are built from the ground up, just like nature does it. Perhaps even more      importantly, Barbalet's simple graphics routines can be transmitted over modems and wires much      more easily than giant digital files. That's why Silicon Valley is drooling. He has delivered to them      the key to creating virtual environments at data rates slow enough to be sent over interactive TV      networks or even today's internet. Taking another cue from nature, Barbalet has organised his entire      Nervanet project as a "public access development forum".The contributions of enthusiasts from      around the world have accelerated his efforts tremendously. His formula for using technology implies      a lesson that any of us in interactive media should heed: instead of imitating nature's results, we      must recreate its processes. Only then might a virtual reality be born. You can sample Tom Barbalet's      work-in-progress on his website atwww.nervana.com
Extended Palm3Com's Palm Computing subsidiary has launched its wireless-connected Palm VII handheld computer/digital organiser across the whole of the US, following four months of trial marketing in New York. And to stimulate sales, it has cut the price by $100 to $499. Web-based booksellerAmazon.com0 also launched a new service, Amazon Anywhere. This has pages designed for the small LCD screens used on the Palm VII and other WIDs (wireless information devices). US-based research firm Dataquest is predicting sales of 5.7 million handheld computers this year, a 47% increase on 1998. Palm says it has sold more than 5 million palmtops since it launched the Palm Pilot in 1996.Sticky notesSony wants to make its Memory Stick system of packaging memory chips more popular, and has licensed the technology to six Japanese electronics companies: Kenwood, Aiwa, Fujitsu, Pioneer, Sanyo and Sharp. Sony has been using the sticks of "flash memory" chips in some of its own cameras and computers for about a year. However, last week's unveiling of the Memory Stick Walkman, a tiny 2.4 ounce digital audio player, could make the system more widely available. Sony says it has already shipped a million Memory Sticks, and it expects to ship another 2 million in the next six months. The $400 Memory Stick Walkman, which will go on sale in Japan before Christmas, was announced as a device for playing copy-protected audio files.  However, it turns out that it will also play net-standard MP3 files, many of which are illegal or pirated copies of songs.Number twoThe world's second-largest computer company is now Fujitsu Siemens Computers, a joint venture that combines the IT operations of Japan's    Fujitsu and Germany's Siemens. It's still a long way from being number two in the UK market, but the company aims to triple its turnover to &#163;1bn by 2001.  Size does not guarantee success. In the 1980s, Sperry and Burroughs, two of the oldest computer manufacturers, combined to form the world's second-largest computer company: Unisys. They were right for about a year, and in 1986, Unisys had a turnover of almost $10bn. But last year's turnover was only $7.2bn and now Unisys isn't even in the top 10.Open SunSun Microsystems, the market leader in Unix workstations and servers, plans to publish the code to Solaris, its proprietary version of Unix, under a "community source license". Sun hopes this will make it more appealing to the programmers who work on GNU/Linux, the published "open source" Unix clone that is growing in popularity.  But while Solaris (formerly called SunOS) is more reliable    and more powerful than GNU/Linux, Sun's terms may not be "open" enough. Eric Raymond, founder of the Open Source Initiative, says: "Sun has tried this scam before with Java and Jini and we are not going to buy it. They are trying to use us as free labour, without making us a partner. Sun retains all the rights... These terms are therefore unacceptable."7 is upMicrosoft has posted yet another version of its DirectX driver software, used in "rich multimedia programs" and 3D games, on its website. Keen users can download DirectX 7 free fromwww.microsoft.com/directxIn the future it will be supplied with any games that require it.It's ItaniumIntel has finally announced the official name of its next-generation 64-bit processor, code-named Merced after a river in Oregon. It's Itanium. Intel's Jami Dover, vice president of sales    and marketing, said: "The key message we wanted to deliver is: this is not a desktop processor. Though we wanted to keep it in the family, like Pentium, we also wanted to make it clear that this is something different."  The made-up name suggests titanium, which is strong and - appropriately enough - expensive. Intel started using trademarked names like Pentium for what would have been the i586 or    80586 because it was unable to prevent rivals like AMD from using the same numbers for compatible processors.Roll on K-9Chip manufacturer AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) is working on a 64-bit microprocessor that will compete against Intel's Merced. Whereas AMD's K-6 proved popular in cheap PCs, and the new 700MHz K-7 or Athlon chip is hounding the Pentium III, the K-8 will try to collar the profitable high-end server market. However, it's not clear whether the American company will go the whole hog and produce an even more powerful K-9 chip. If so, the BBC's Dr Who series might turn out to have pioneered one of the more far-sighted examples of "concept PC" packaging...
A group of digital artists has won an award for work created by their audience. Invisible Geographies, which is on display at the Institute of Contemporary Art, was created using Linker, a piece of software written by the south London collective Mongrel. It is one of the four winners of the &#163;50,000 Imaginaria prize.Linker is a multi-media authoring tool that functions like a simpler version of Macromedia's Director.  To produce Invisible Geographies, eight workshops, led by members of Mongrel, were held in Bristol and London.People from different cultural backgrounds were shown how to use Linker to compile their personal social geography of their city in sound and vision. Visitors to the exhibition can navigate round these virtual communities by computer.Audience participation is   far from new in the digital arts: interactivity is what usually separates digital works from older artistic forms.  Fellow Imaginaria winners Scanner and Tonne, and Pope and Gutherie, also use audience participation.  But Mongrel offers something stronger: a work that excludes the artist from the generation of content, in order to question how that content is generated.The Linker has a more   practical purpose too. Once the Imaginaria exhibition is over, the group plans to take the Linker into deprived areas - to encourage the "information poor" to get involved in new technology. The Linker can be mastered in an afternoon with no previous training."We work with people others cannot reach. Our own people," says Mongrel member Mervin Jarman.Mongrel has a reputation for producing work full of provocative content -   previous works have explored issues of racism and mental health.  "During our previous work we would get people excited and then they would get hit with all the technical details," says Jarman.  "The Linker makes all that simple and lets people get on with exploring ideas."So, the Linker shows how software is complicit with   the creative process for good or ill.  Putting the Linker in a gallery poses questions on how we create content and who has access to that process, which in turn creates software as art.Harwood, the group's main programmer, says: "In the same way that we forget the map and remember the journey, we also forget the software that writes the text. He adds: "Software exists in some form of shadow world of process, something like the key we find in maps."&#149;  Imaginaria runs at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, until October 31.&#149;  Invisible Geographies is also showing at the Watershed Bristol (0117 927 6444) until October 30.
Tax burdenWhat have we done to deserve such a clobbering? The Inland Revenue's changed regulations (Tax Threat to Freelances, September 30) reveal nothing less than a determined vendetta against the most talented, focused, and hard-working segment of the IT industry.  The IT sector is typified by aggressive deadlines on urgent projects within tight budgets. In accepting short contracts, funding all our own training, and working far from home, we enable clients to achieve things that would otherwise be impossible. The suggestion that this is "disguised employment" betrays a complete misunderstanding of the unique added-value that contract staff offer. Not for the first time, the    Inland Revenue appears to be set on killing the goose that lays the most golden eggs.Ian Shearer,Lytham St. AnnesRegardless of the rights and wrongs of tax avoidance, IR35 will catch a lot of people who are only marginally computer contractors, and it will either make it impossible for them to carry on or make their businesses very insecure. I work as a technical author. My contracts are much shorter than those of software developers, and the periods between therefore longer. And, in seven years, I have paid all my taxes but I have yet to pay myself a dividend. Few companies have the amount of work to employ technical authors - that's why they use contractors - so I don't come under the control of anyone else professionally.Technical management rarely understands how a technical author goes about his or her work, so I have invested a lot of my company's income in hardware and software to ensure that I can do my job professionally. Educating others in what I can offer is an important part of my work.   However, it appears that I may well come under the new legislation because I have to spend a lot of my time on site, I often obtain work through agencies and I report to the manager of whatever project team I am working with.  Even if I don't, what agency is going to take a chance on falling foul of the new legislation in a marginal case? It seems that IR35 will drastically affect my cashflow, the amount that I can invest in the business and the risk I can take in exploring new types of work - which might lead to my creating employment.Richard Burnhamww@wisewordsco.comFaster fixYour article on internet addiction failed to notice what I see as one of the main reasons why I and others stay online for so long. And of course it is the standard UK internet user's gripe - BT. I only stay online for ages because I have to stay online for that time in order to download the files I need. I'm pretty much convinced a high speed in to my house would have me cured instantly.Alex Ingramalex@good1.demon.co.ukNot addictsFurther to your article on internet addiction (Netaholics anonymous): Dr Kimberley Young's attempts to make distinctions between cybersexual addictions, cyber-relationship addictions, net compulsion, information overload and computer addiction are misleading.  I would argue that many of these excessive users are not internet addicts but just use the internet excessively as a medium to fuel other addictions. A gambling addict or a computer game addict is not addicted to the internet. The internet is just the place where they engage in the behaviour.However, in my own research I have certainly identified a small number of cases who appear to be addicted to the internet itself. These are usually people who use internet chatrooms or play fantasy role playing games - activities that they would not engage in except on the internet itself.  These individuals to some extent are engaged in text-based virtual realities and take on other personas and social identities as a way of    making themselves feel good about themselves.  In these cases, the internet provides an alternative reality to the user and allows them feelings of immersion and anonymity which may be psychologically rewarding. Such immersion may actually lead to an altered state of consciousness which in itself may be highly psychologically and/or physiologically rewarding.Dr Mark Griffiths,Head of Psychology,  Nottingham Trent  UniversityFree warningRegarding free domain names (Online 2 September) you forgot to mention that the company freenetname charges &#163;94 if you decide to move your free (but precious to you) domain name to another ISP.

Sitting in a Notting Hill hotel, the American science fiction author William Gibson is joking about how he's managed to avoid the embarrassment of ever seeing himself on TV. "It has been difficult though. There's a cable channel called the SF Channel I sometimes watch, which throws in random sound bites from me as it goes along." He laughs. "But so far my luck has held out."Most authors don't need to worry about seeing themselves pop up unexpectedly on the small screen. But then, Gibson is a special case. With his early novels - in particular Neuromancer, his 1984   debut - he redefined science fiction, returning it to a recognisably sleazy urban world, swapping ray guns for smart computers and brand name consumer electronics.This fictional mix was labelled cyberpunk and a movement was born. The term was adopted by real hackers, musicians and designers ("Bohemians with computers," says Gibson).But Gibson is more likely to get recognition now as the man who came up with the word cyberspace. With Neuromancer, Gibson gave science fiction a new dimension: the global computer networks that were just beginning to emerge when Gibson wrote it. Cyberspace   helped to crystallise the sense that these networks were a kind of place, somewhere people could go and make things happen.Bruce Sterling (the best known of the cyberpunk SF authors, aside from Gibson) says that for his generation, "the net was our spaceship".Gibson agrees. When he started writing in the late seventies, he wanted to treat science fiction as "this big conveniently-abandoned pop artefact that I could take over. To do that, I knew I would have to find my own rocket ship and that the rocket ship would be at once the arena and the narrative mode. That did lead directly to the concept of cyberspace."The term proved so potent that all sorts of people have fallen under its spell, reading their own meanings into it, using it to travel to all sorts of places. You get the feeling Gibson enjoys that. What he doesn't like is being treated as a prophet - someone who "predicted the net". He didn't, he insists gently in his soft-spoken Southern drawl.Gibson has continually pointed out that he uses the imagery of SF to highlight what's going on in the present, the way computer technology is changing what it means to be human.But people still want to believe. Increasingly his fiction has taken swipes at them. His last novel, Idoru   (which centres on a future rock star who wants to marry a computer generated pop star, the "idoru" of the title) introduced Laney, a drug-damaged researcher whose sensitivity to data lets him see patterns emerging in the information on the net. As a result, he can see where change might happen but can't predict it exactly."What Laney does looks to me like a metaphor for what I actually do as opposed to the sound bite version of what I do - which is like, 'Listen to him, he's your hot ticket to the future. He knows what's going to happen'. For 20 years, I've been saying, 'No, I don't know what's going to happen'," says Gibson.Laney takes a starring role in Gibson's new novel, All Tomorrow's Parties, published today by Viking, &#163;16.99. His sensitivity to information patterns has convinced him that the world is about to change in some way, probably in San Francisco. In other words, Gibson's new book is a millennial novel but an ironic one, which points out nothing much happened when people were expecting it to happen (ie in the next three months)."Y2K and the bug have made everyone on the planet aware of computers and interconnectivity in a way they weren't before. That's its historical significance. The only thing I expect to happen is that a lot of pissed-off survivalists will emerge from bunkers in Idaho realising that they've spent their life savings on cans of beans and ammunition and that the world is still there."In All Tomorrow's Parties, it's two decades or so on from Y2K and the thing that may or may not change everything is nanotechnology (miniature machines created from, and capable of manipulating, individual atoms). What interests Gibson is the battle between Laney and the villain, Harwood, a PR man who has Laney's sensitivity to information patterns but has used it get rich.He's setting up a network of "nanofax" machines, though he has no idea what people will use them for. The impor tant thing is to get the network in place and control it.It's hard not to see Bill Gates in here somewhere. Gibson says Harwood is more an emblem of his distrust of PR. He had intended to make All Tomorrow's Parties a more political novel, "but I came to the conclusion that politics had become public relations. I think the Monica Lewinsky sequence put paid to any overtly political SF I might have written. I thought, 'This makes my job too hard. I can't parody this'."That said, All Tomorrow's Parties feels more intimate than Gibson's previous works. It forms a trilogy with Idoru and 1993's Virtual Light, bringing back characters and settings from the early books. Gibson looks embarrassed to have written yet another trilogy (Neuromancer had two linked follow-ups, Count Zero and Mona Lisa Overdrive).But he has used the trilogy form cleverly. The characters spend a lot of time looking back on what happened in the previous books. It helps readers who start with this novel, but it also makes it clear that the book is about memory, about people, who though they live in the future, are, like a lot of us, trying to figure out their individual pasts.This all comes together round the book's signature technology, the various mid-twentieth century wristwatches collected by the owner of a future junk shop owner and described as "pocket museums", living machines that carry the seductive traces of history, both individual and collective.At the start of the year, Gibson wrote a wonderful piece for Wired magazine about how he briefly became addicted to bidding on old watches at the online auction site eBay. He has kept his distance from the net, preferring to think about it rather than do it. But Gibson described eBay as the first "real" place he had found on the net.However, he doesn't use it so much now. His time online is now taken up with email and the odd "search engine   tumble. If I do that I'm lost for half an hour at least because one thing leads to another, usually with not much result. But I think it's not about where you go. It's about the process of the connections. It's about the experience of being taken somewhere".Recently Gibson co-wrote an episode of The X Files, about an AI (Artificial Intellligence) program attaining consciousness. He enjoyed that and is thinking of doing another. He's also being drawn back to the film world, despite his bad experiences there. The first film to be based on his work, Johnny Mnemonic (Gibson wrote the script, American artist Robert Longo directed, Keanu Reeves starred) was "re-cut and re-conceptualised" by the producers."The result was neither fish nor fowl. People thought that we were just incredibly stupid and I don't blame them. It was a learning experience."There are various films based on Gibson's fiction in the works. The first to arrive will be Abel Ferrara's New Rose Hotel. Gibson says he's most looking forward to the proposed Neuromancer film being put together by British video director Chris Cunningham.As for his fiction, he feels he's finished something off with the new book, that, in some way, he's done with cyberspace. He says his next novel might be set in the present."In response to a question about what genre his films were, David Cronenberg said his only ambition was to make Cronenberg films. I want to write a William Gibson novel."As opposed to an SF novel? "Yeah. But I also don't want anyone to notice the difference. That way I'd know I'd really pulled it off."&#149; Jim Mclellan is the author of the best selling Guardian Guide to the Internet. The second edition has just been published.

1 The big idea:Carol Dukes, a serial internet entrepreneur now launching health and beauty website ThinkNatural.com, always asks herself the same question: Why bother? "Whatever your idea, make sure there are some real benefits to be gained by providing the product/service/experience on the internet rather than through conventional channels, and then focus on those benefits."According to one entrepreneur, an internet start-up is like writing a novel. Everyone has one in them. But don't make the mistake of believing you're the only one thinking of it. Another start-up, Click Mango, is about to launch against ThinkNatural.com.Most of the obvious ideas are already out there. There is no point deciding to launch an online book retailer or auction house. If you do pitch yourself against established sites, you need to offer something new or extra, such as better products, better technology or lower prices. When Freeserve launched there were already hundreds of service providers out there, but it redefined the model by dropping the subscription fee.2 The team:The technical know-how can be outsourced, as can web design, but most venture capitalists will be looking for an IT person in the core team. "I would be looking for someone with commercial experience who could sell and a technician who could build the site and deliver," says Gerald Brady at venture capital group 3i.You may not even be the one to run your company, particularly as the business grows. Tim Jackson, who launched auction house QXL, effectively sacked himself. Remember that good people are attracted by the offer of equity in the company.3 The brand:A brand name that people will remember is vital, and partially accounts for the success of companies such as lastminute.com. Users don't come across a website while trundling down the high street - they have to direct themselves to it.4 The pitch:In the US they say you should be able to explain your idea in the time it takes to complete an elevator ride. If you find that difficult, you may not have thought it through properly. Spend a bit of cash on the presentation to potential investors - remember the larger ones receive up to 20 a day. "You need to give the impression that you are six months further down the line than you really are," says one.5 The networking:Events such as the weekly get-together First Tuesday (www.firsttuesday.com) can be useful for meeting potential business partners and for getting advice from people who are a couple of years ahead of you. Because the industry is still so new, there appears to be a healthy sense of camaraderie. "Most people will meet you for half an hour to dish out advice if you call them," says Robert Norton of Click Mango. They are also good places to meet lawyers, investors and public relations agencies.6 The funding:Many of the entrepreneurs featured in the Guardian e50 got initial seed capital to get the site up and running from friends and family. The cost of getting a website online can be anything from &#163;30,000 to &#163;1m, depending on how many features it has and the number of people that will have access to your site at any one time.There is a lot of money swilling around from venture capitalists   eager to invest in the next big thing in return for a stake in your company. Some of the most common names are 3i, Apax, NewMedia ventures, Atlas Ventures, Durlacher and Botts &amp; Co. Rupert Murdoch has set up eVentures to help start-ups and Bernard Arnault of LVMH has established Europ@web.It may be worth trying the US, where investors are more used to internet start-ups and are often better at providing advice and appointing experienced people to your board. Another alternative is so-called incubators, which provide office space or equipment in return for a stake.Eva Pascoe, who runs online clothing retailer Zoom, adds a word of warning however. "Venture capitalists won't give you money for nothing. They will be on the phone the next   day to find out if their money is OK. They are sharks and that's their job."7 The marketing:As bigger companies turn their sights to the internet they can employ bigger resources. Word of mouse may not be enough any more to make a website a success. Jungle.com has committed &#163;7.5m to its launch.8 The graft:Most net entrepreneurs need little prompting to tell you how hard they work. Jackson at QXL says: "Show me an internet millionaire and I'll show you someone who has not spent time with their family in a very long while. Running a start-up was the toughest working experience of my life. The hours, the stress, the risk and the uncertainty were almost unbearable."9 The timing:Get a move on. Most agree that the window of opportunity to make your internet fortune is small - the slumbering corporations with ready-made brand names are waking up.10 The exit:If an investor pays &#163;1m for 25% of your company and you hold 75%, you are in theory worth another &#163;3m. The chief ways to bank that cash are a trade sale to another company or by floating on the stock market and selling your shares. In the current market, offers to buy may come surprisingly early, but it may be worth holding out to build value. Becoming a paper millionaire is relatively easy. Becoming a real one is a bit harder.&#149; Talk to net entrepreneurs Brent Hoberman of lastminute.com and Eva Pascoe of Zoom on News Unlimited at 2.30pm today.&#149; Order the new edition of the Guardian Guide to the Internet (&#163;5.99, p&amp;p free), tel: 01483 20 44 55
Ewan MacLeod, a rangy 21-year-old yet to shake off the awkwardness of his teenage years, is the technical know-how behind Liv4now, a fledgling internet business "devoted to hedonism", which is already worth &#163;9m-&#163;12.5m.His business partner, Serena Doshi, is a veteran by comparison at 27. The former corporate financier is presently in New York tying up legal loose ends and paying visits to two company board members - a former president of NBC and an erstwhile Time Warner director.MacLeod's slightly sallow looks and the bags beneath the eyes are testament to a youth spent sitting in front of a computer screen. A Scot who moved to Billericay in Essex when he was 10, MacLeod was acting as a computer consultant by the   time he was 15. Two years later he was hosting a chat room for AOL after discussing the idea online with the company's American chief executive. The teenage chatroom, which he ran on a voluntary basis, became the second most visited site on AOL in the UK. At university MacLeod ran a site for Virgin Net, this time for a fee.He met Doshi in November 1998 when he arrived at her house to fix a printer for a friend. Over a coffee, the pair lamented that the internet was failing to cater for people like themselves, twentysomethings who liked clubbing and bars. "I told her what I'd like to do but had no idea where to get financing," MacLeod recalls.Two months later they were trawling the US for backing for what is effectively a more sophisticated version of MacLeod's chatrooms. Doshi, who has a first-class law and accounting degree from Exeter   university, spent four years at Arthur Andersen, and used contacts to find an investor who put in &#163;250,000."We went to the US because even a year ago people were still asking 'what's e-commerce?' in this country," says Doshi.In March she quit her job to concentrate on the business and the company is in the process of concluding its second round of funding. The two founders still have the majority of the company's shares.Despite the site's theme, the pair are not taking it easy. MacLeod looks slightly abashed when asked why he wasn't out getting drunk at university instead of working every evening. "I had responsibilities," he says.His millions, he says, are "paper-based money. I've got &#163;4.50 in my pocket." Still, as it later transpires when it is time to pay the bill, he also has a brand new company credit card.

The outsiderEva Pascoe cuts an unlikely figure as the grand dame of the UK internet scene. At the age of 34 she is already on her fourth business and where the fortunes of many other internet millionaires are still virtual, she has actually pocketed several million pounds.Pascoe has now graduated to what could pass for the establishment and runs Zoom, a home-shopping website jointly owned   by Arcadia, the former Burton Group, and Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail.Brought up in Poland, Pascoe is part of the wave of business people who have arrived in Britain from abroad and led the way on the internet."There are at least 100 internet start-ups in this country right now and maybe 10 of those will float on the stock market. That's a one in 10 chance of becoming a millionaire. Where else could you get   those kinds of odds?" she asks.She studied computational linguistics at Warsaw university and came to London, where she read cognitive psychology at Birkbeck college.Pascoe raised &#163;3,000 to finance her first venture, a software company, by knitting and selling mohair jumpers. "This was in the middle of a deep recession and here was I, a woman with a funny accent - the banks just laughed at me," she says. Two businesses later   she was still being turned away and eventually got funding for Cyberia Cafe from Maurice Saatchi."I have a theory that England went through a very strange process in the 1970s," she says. "There was no competition, markets were carved up by large companies and there was no funding. The mindset was that things couldn't be done and I can still see that in people's upbringing here. But things are changing. You can see it in the 25-year-olds coming up."   She declines to put an exact figure on her wealth but collected &#163;800,000 from the sale of the cafe chain.Pascoe feels she has another one, maybe two, companies left in her after which she plans to settle down into a few non-executive directorships. "Why would I want to compete against 25-year-olds when I'm over 40?" But, she quickly adds, "of course I reserve the right to change my mind."

The DJPaul Myers left school in Dagenham, Essex at 16 to become a DJ in Marbella, Spain. Two years later he was taken on by Peter Stringfellow as the resident DJ at London's Hippodrome nightclub. A career in the music industry beckoned when at 28 he produced his first platinum album, Boomania by Betty Boo.But while working on new ways to promote bands and albums he stumbled across the internet. "It was 1995 and the net was so disappointing then," Myers, now 32, says. "It was just a grey screen with lots of text and it took forever to find anything. It was only when I found out that millions of people used the thing that I realised the selling possibility it presented. Why weren't Coca-Cola showing their logo while internet users were waiting for their search engine?"With a few like-minded friends Myers set up GOD, which he says was the first UK web directory service. They also started designing web pages for companies including Capital Radio, Virgin and Camelot. But "we had about 1,600 subscribers and the whole thing was making about two quid a week. I met this guy from Canada, Chris Sekornyk, who offered to buy our modems off us. I asked him why and he said wanted to set up an ISP &#91;internet service provider&#93; in Canada. We got chatting, worked out it could work here too and then realised that if we made money from phone calls and advertising we could offer the service free." On March 9 1998 The X-Stream Network became Britain's first free ISP. Myers says it has 450,000 customers in the UK and it has recently reached Norway and Sweden.Freeserve, Dixons' free internet service, has overtaken X-Stream in   subscriber numbers, but Myers still controls a substantial business. He won't say how much of X-Stream he owns, only that the whole business is worth "hundreds of millions".Myers says the scene has changed dramatically since 1995. "When I started out only programmers used the net, but everyone is getting into it for the money now."He plans to enjoy the ride - he is awaiting delivery of a new Jaguar XK8. And his ambition? "To win the British F1 Grand Prix and then marry Kelly Brook on my own private James Bond-style island." His immediate focus is developing X-Stream's Scandinavian business. "After that, no one's quite sure. That's the beauty of this thing."www.x-stream.com
