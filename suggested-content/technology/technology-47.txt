Apple is throwing its weight around in an attempt to stem the tide of leaks that preceded the launch of the iPhone 6 and 6+, as the rumour mill begins to turn its attention to the next in line.Accessory manufacturers ​are the latest group to be on the receiving end of Apple’s ​attentions, and the company has reportedly written to them warning that they should not be reading rumours as they prepare to design accessories for the next generation of​ iPhones.Related:Tim Cook hails Apple Watch health benefits: 'Sitting is the new cancer'According to 9to5Mac’s Jordan Kahn, the company asked manufacturers to sign an agreement which reads, in part: “Should Apple find that, prior to the release of a product, you have sought, obtained, or relied upon specifications of that product from sources other than Apple, Apple may choose to exercise its right to take action against you, which penalties can include, but are not limited to, Apple choosing not to stock your product in our stores.”Before the iPhone 6 was released, a number of extremely accurate leaks about the device’s look and feel were traced back to accessory makers. In April 2014, for instance, almost six months before the phone hit stores, a rumour site called Ukrainian iPhoneposted images of computer renderswhich manufacturers were using to design cases for the new device.But questions remain as to whether Apple’s new hardball approach will actually succeed in stemming the tide of leaks. The vast majority – by units sold, if not by profit made – of iPhone case manufacturers have little to do with the Californian firm itself. The sort of cases picked up for pocket change in a roadside kiosk are unlikely to ever be stocked in the Apple Store and do​ not have the company’s “Made for iPhone” branding, leaving Apple with little leverage over what they do and don’t look at.Related:London smartphone theft drops by 50% after 'kill switch' introductionLarger accessory manufacturers, however, might feel the strain, particularly given the broad phrasing of the agreement. Kahn writes that “after consulting Apple about the agreement’s language, one developer said that it amounted to a prohibition on reading any web site or newspaper that even discussed upcoming Apple products, including The New York Times”.
As a theatrical venue it has seen almost 300 years of intrigue, conflict and drama, but it’s unlikely the patrons of the Royal Opera House will have witnessed anything quite like this. The imposing building, which has recently hosted thrilling productions of Der Fliegende Holländer and Il Barbiere di Siviglia has been chosen as the venue for the 2015 European Call of Duty championships.Replacing renowned operatic singers and sumptuous sets will be teams from all over the continent playing a multimillion-selling military shooter. Their aim will not be the adulation of an adoring crowd, though that will come, but to qualify for the world finals in Los Angeles on 27 March.Taking place over two days from 28 February, the event will host 28 teams from the UK, France, Italy, Germany and the rest of Europe, as well as competitors from the Middle East. The prize fund is $10,000 (£6,500) but, for the qualifiers, the reward is a shot at the 2015 Call of Duty title, where $1m is shared between the three top-placing squads.Related:Does eSports put too much pressure on regular gamers?“We try to find iconic venues that are fun and different,” said Neville Upton, co-founder of Gfinity, the UK-based eSports events organiser running the tournament for Call of Duty publisher Activision. “Last year we used Twickenham, which was a fantastic venue too. We’re trying to make a statement about eSports – one of our challenges is to make people realise how big it is. We need to use iconic venues, and the Royal Opera House is certainly that.”Professional gaming is on the rise as a spectator sport. Last year over 70 million people regularly watched eSports tournaments, mostly via live online streaming channels such as Twitch TV, which now boasts over 55 million viewers a month. The most popular titles are strategy sims like Starcraft II, and team-based “moba” (multiplayer online battle arena) game such as League of Legends and Dota 2, but shooters such as Call of Duty and Counter Strike: Global Offensive have huge followings too.In South Korea, where eSports has been a major spectator phenomenon for over a decade, the biggest tournaments create the same buzz as major football finals or pop concerts. The 2013 League of Legends world championships were held in Seoul’s World Cup Stadium and attracted a crowd of 40,000. Pro-gaming is now gaining global traction as a spectator sport: tickets for last year’s International Dota 2 tournament at Seattle’s Key Arena sold out in an hour.Related:How video gaming turned into the world's newest spectator sport“Pro-gaming is not as big as the most popular sports, but it’s getting there,” said Upton. “However, in terms of how long fans actually spend watching, eSports fans are probably the most dedicated. The 70 million people who viewed eSports regularly last year were watching 19 times a month. What this demographic isn’t doing is watching TV, they’re watching or playing games instead. We held an amateur tournament before Christmas and got over 600,000 people watching online.”London may soon be getting its own dedicated eSports venue. According to Upton, Gfinity is working with a partner to build a 500-seat space and has selected a location, which will be announced later in February.“We’re going to have an event every weekend, it’s a regular venue,” said Upton. “Within five years I can imagine dedicated eSports stadiums in ever major city around the world.”For now, however, eSports will need to slum it alongside productions of Swan Lake and the Magic Flute.
You know what’s cooler than a million passwords? 10m passwords. Although evenFacebook-era Sean Parkermight raise an eyebrow at said passwords being published online alongside their associated usernames for all to see.That’s what security researcher Mark Burnett has done, though – but his intentions are benign. Burnett has built his database of usernames and passwords for the purposes of research into how password security can improve.“Frequently I get requests from students and security researchers to get a copy of my password research data. I typically decline to share the passwords but for quite some time I have wanted to provide a clean set of data to share with the world,” hewrote in a blog postthis week.Burnett has done exactly that, despite fears that he could be arrested for releasing the information. As evidence, he citedthe case of journalist Barrett Brown, who posted a link in a chatroom to a “data dump” of leaked personal information of private intelligence firm Stratfor in 2012.“Suddenly even linking to data was an excuse to get raided by the FBI and potentially face serious charges. Even more concerning is that Brown linked to data that was already public and others had already linked to,” wrote Burnett.Related:What is the world's weakest password? Even worse than 'password'In his blog post, Burnett explained that by publishing his own dataset of usernames and passwords, he wants to “further research with the goal of making authentication more secure” rather than harm the security of those internet users.“Although researchers typically only release passwords, I am releasing usernames with the passwords. Analysis of usernames with passwords is an area that has been greatly neglected and can provide as much insight as studying passwords alone.Most researchers are afraid to publish usernames and passwords together because combined they become an authentication feature. If simply linking to already released authentication features in a private IRC channel was considered trafficking, surely the FBI would consider releasing the actual data to the public a crime.”Burnett stressed that he had removed the domain portion from email addresses; mixed data samples from various security breaches over the last 10 years to avoid any single company’s data being too obvious; removed keywords that might give away the source of the logins; removed credit card and financial account numbers; stripped out as many entries from government and military sources as he could; and manually reviewed the data to remove any other information that might be linked to an individual.He added that all the data is, or at least was, available to anyone and discoverable via search engines, suggesting that it was thus already available to cybercriminals, and also that breached companies have already had plenty of time to reset passwords and warn their employees.“I could have released this data anonymously like everyone else does but why should I have to? I clearly have no criminal intent here,” wrote Burnett.“It is beyond all reason that any researcher, student, or journalist have to be afraid of law enforcement agencies that are supposed to be protecting us instead of trying to find ways to use the laws against us.”The dataset, made available as an 84.7MB download, appears to have been popular:&quot;4,800,104 requests saved by CloudFlare&quot; &#10;Even with that my web server has been stressing&mdash; Mark Burnett (@m8urnett)February 11, 2015Burnett has also been tweeting links to researchers who’ve been exploring the data, including a Twitter account –@10millioncombos– which is a bot tweeting all the logins from his password dump.Headdeda further defence against accusations that publishing the data will harm internet users’ security rather than improve it. “No, every hack today wasn’t because of the passwords I released. Seriously you people are like my father-in-law when I fix his computer.”
Of all the people one would expect to understand how Twitter works, the company’s own chief financial officer is probably fairly high up the list.And yet Anthony Noto, Twitter’s CFO, briefly lost his account after falling for a simple hack on Tuesday. At least, that’s the assumed cause of him tweeting hundreds of followers with spammy links such as “this pic of you is funny lol” and “I can’t stop laughing!”Related:Twitter: what we learned from the social network's latest financial resultsShortly after the spammy links started flowing, Noto’s account was suspended by the company. Twitter explained: “His account was sending spam Tweets. We’ve locked down the account and deleted the tweets.”It’s not the first time Noto’s fallen prey to elementary Twitter mistakes, either. In November 2014 he managed to leak details of apparent merger talks through a “DM fail” – accidentally sending as a public tweet a message meant as a private direct message.Noto tweeted: “I still think we should buy them. He is on your schedule for Dec 15 or 16 – we will need to ​sell him. i have a plan.”Observers were quick to point fingers at Mic News, a youth-focused news website, as the topic of his DM, appeared in part prompted by yet another Twitter indiscretion: he had followed both co-founders and two other editors shortly before sending the accidentally-public tweet. Whether or not the talks happened is unknown, but no merger occurred.
Smartphones thefts have declined dramatically in three major cities since manufacturers began implementing “kill switches” that allow the phones to be turned off remotely if they are stolen.The number of smartphones stolen dropped by 50% in London, 27% in San Francisco and 16% in New York in 2014, according to an announcement by officials in the three cities.After Apple added a kill switch to its devices in September 2013, iPhone thefts specifically were down 40% in San Francisco and 25% in New York year-on-year.Related:Apple iPhone 'kill switch' cuts thefts – and Microsoft and Google are to followIn 2014, Samsung added a kill switch to some of its smartphones, while Google added a kill switch to its latest Android operating system Lollipop. Microsoft has promised to add a kill switch to its smartphones by July 2015.London Mayor Boris Johnson said: “We have made real progress in tackling the smartphone theft epidemic that was affecting many major cities just two years ago.”Johnson, San Francisco district attorney George Gascon and New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman were among numerous officials arguing for new laws mandating the kill switches.In California, where a law mandating kill switches has yet to go into effect, smartphone theft is dropping because some manufacturers have already started installing the software-based switches on the devices they sell, Gascon said.“The wireless industry continues to roll out sophisticated new features, but preventing their own customers from being the target of a violent crime is the coolest technology they can bring to market,” he said.California’s law, one of the US’s strongest, received wide support from California prosecutors and law enforcement agencies that hoped it could help reduce smartphone thefts.According to the US National Consumers League, 1.6m handheld devices were stolen in the US in 2012. In California, smartphone theft accounts for more than half of all crimes in San Francisco, Oakland and other cities.Other states experiencing a high rate of smartphone thefts have considered similar measures, and Minnesota passed a theft-prevention law last year.Some of the smartphone systems require consumers to opt in, meaning not all will be protected when their phones are operating by default.Gascon, Johnson and Schneiderman called on all manufacturers to make the technology active as a default position, as Apple has done with its iPhones.
It’s Wednesday.
Apple chief executive Tim Cook has pitched health as one of the key selling points for his company’s upcoming Apple Watch smartwatch, including its hourly reminders to owners to be more active.“If I sit for too long, it will actually tap me on the wrist to remind me to get up and move, because a lot of doctors think sitting is the new cancer,” said Cook during an on-stage interview at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet conference.“Ten minutes before the hour, it will remind you to move. We have a lot of people using the Apple Watch at Apple, and ten minutes before the hour, suddenly they all get up and move. It took a little to get used to, but it’s great.”Cook was bullish about the Apple Watch’s prospects when it launches in April, admitting that there are already several competitors in the market but suggesting that “none have changed the way people live their lives... one of the biggest surprises for Apple Watch will be the breadth of what it can do”.Cook also pressed the privacy credentials of Apple Pay, the company’s recently-launched mobile payments technology, claiming that it runs against that industry’s trend for data collection on shoppers.“We believe customers have a right to privacy, and the vast majority of customers don’t want people knowing everything about them,” said Cook,according to Mac Rumors.Related:Is 'sitting the new cancer'? What Apple CEO Tim Cook really meant“When you make a purchase, we make a little bit of money. It’s very simple, very straightforward. You are not our product, that’s our product. There’s no need for us to know what you’re buying, where you’re buying, I don’t want to know any of that.”Cook talked up Apple’s growing business in China, and pooh-poohed past suggestions that the company could not succeed there with iPhones that were more expensive to buy than locally-made Android smartphones.“We had lots of people telling us we needed to do something different in China to compete. That’s a bunch of bull,” he said. “People everywhere want quality. Not everyone can afford one, but there’s a big market there.”Cook’s appearance came as Apple announced plans to spend $850m building a 1,300-acre solar farm in Monterey to power its offices and retail stores in California.“We at Apple know climate change is real. The time for talk is past and the time for action is now,” he said. “All of our data centers are now on renewable energy... It’s the right thing to do both socially and financially.”
Televisions can now listen to what we’re saying. If that sounds like something from a book, that’s because it is.A line buried in a Samsung Smart TV privacy policydescribes how “spoken words” will be “captured and transmitted from a third party” through a voice command function.It has resonated particularly powerfully because it bears remarkable resemblance to the dystopian world envisioned byGeorge Orwell in 1984. In the novel – published in 1949 – citizens of Airstrip One (which used to be Great Britain) are subjected to a brutal regime that watches their every move, and attempts to monitor their every thought.Surveillance is extensive in this frightening world. So much so that the televisions (or telescreens) directly monitor citizens. They can’t turn them off. They’re always there, watching, waiting, and you never know who is at the other end.Related:Samsung rejects concern over 'Orwellian' privacy policyIt’s a frightening image. But Orwell’s 65-year-old vision of the future is distinctly analog. The unfortunate reality is that televisions are the least of our worries in a world that listens, follows and watches us more and more.You’re might be reading this on a laptop now, but how do you know your microphone and camera aren’t on? And if you’re reading this on your phone, you know that all your movements are being sent back to the company, right? And did you use Google to find this story? If you did, your searches have probably also been stored.The point is that it all goes far beyond just a television. Part of the reason for this is that companies like collecting data. They usually do it because it helps them make money. This means that they will, inevitably, overreach and seek more data, like collecting voice samples from people.The problem is what happens next. Who is the third party the Samsung TV – or any of these devices – transmits to?An unusual feature of Australian privacy lawis that it allows your data to be sent overseas to a country that has “substantially similar” privacy laws. What does that mean? It’s never been decided. Notice of this transfer should be given – but in some circumstances that can be delayed until as soon as “reasonably possible” after the fact.The retention of all of this data, and patchy privacy laws, inevitably gives rise to uses that were never anticipated when the data was initially seized. Almost any of this data collected by these private entities can then be passed on, or sold, to third parties. Sometimes this can be other organisations, but it can also be to government and law enforcement agencies,such as in the case of requests for phone and web metadata.So if you’re not comfortable with televisions that you can talk to but that might pass on your whispers to other parties, don’t buy one. But don’t forget that the world of digital surveillance is far bigger than just a screen.
Flipboard came to prominence as a news-reading app for tablets and smartphones, attracting more than 50 million monthly active readers by the end of 2014.Now it’s launching a fully-fledged website version where people will be able to browse their feeds of news and social updates. What’s more, Flipboard will also be hosting some publishers’ articles and splitting the advertising revenues with them.“We’re moving Flipboard to the web. A lot of people think of Flipboard as an app, but Flipboard is really an overall service: a curation network that people are using to follow their interests, and curate their interests,” says chief executive Mike McCue, during a pre-launch demo of the new site.“We want to make Flipboard more universally acceptable to people by moving it to the web. And also to help people who have gone through the process of personalising their Flipboard to take advantage of that when sitting at their desktop.”The new website is a big move for Flipboard: besides giving its users another way to read, it also smashes down the walled garden around its apps, and makes the service part of the open web.That’s particularly important for two Flipboard features in particular: “magazines”, which wereintroduced to its apps in March 2013, and “topics”, whichlaunched in October 2014.The first enables Flipboard users to curate their own digital magazines on any themes they like, with other users able to follow them. More than 15m of them have been created. Topics, meanwhile, enables people to follow feeds of articles about tens of thousands of subjects: from food and football to beekeeping, virtual reality or Taylor Swift.Related:Flipboard 2.0 looks to make everyone the editor of their own magazineFlipboard is taking all these magazines and topics from its closed apps to the open web: whether curated by humans or algorithms, its collections of articles will be findable within search engines and much more shareable on social networks. As examples, here are the magazines I created fordrones,3D printingandvirtual realityto test the new features.In short, as a website with a deep, long tail of magazines and topics, Flipboard could now be attracting a lot more viewers, showing a lot more ads to those people, and thus making a lot more money.Yet this content will also now be more obviously in direct competition with the websites of the news publishers whose stories are shared (or “flipped”) on Flipboard. Which is one reason why the company wants to persuade more of those publishers to let Flipboard host their content, rather than just linking to it.Also key to that is the slick nature of Flipboard’s new website, which swaps the page-flipping interface of the app for a vertical feed of stories for users to scroll through, with images to the fore.‘This is something art directors do...’Editorial purists look away now: McCue says Flipboard’s new site is doing the job of an art director from a traditional print magazine in the way it matches text-box colours to their accompanying images, and in its placement of headlines within large photos to ensure they don’t obscure key details.“This is something art directors do on a regular basis in print. We’re doing it through an algorithm, and it works really, really well. We’ve created some really great technology in terms of how to integrate different colours, type sizes and fonts to make it feel more magazine-like.”One thing missing from the demo was advertising, but ads will certainly be a presence on Flipboard’s new website, as they are within its apps.“Advertising will play a role here, just like it does on Flipboard, but they will continue to be beautiful magazine-like ads that feel like a natural part of the experience – like full-page ads you find in a magazine,” says McCue.Irked art directors aside, what will news publishers make of Flipboard’s new site? Since its launch, Flipboard has divided opinion within the publishing industry between people who embrace its aggregation model, and people who distrust it.In fact, sometimes it’s divided opinion within media companies, for example when The Economist’s digital team struck a distribution deal with Flipboard shortly before the company’s chief executive criticised it as “a head-on competitor” and “problematic”.Flipboard’s magazines will be part of its new website.The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, CNN, Lonely Planet and (disclosure)the Guardianare among the publishers that have partnered with Flipboard, including experimenting with reformatting their articles and sharing ad revenues.“Our strategy from the very beginning has been to do all of this in partnership with publishers: to enable them to create content and have that content find its maximum audience around the world,” says McCue.“We want to be a distribution vehicle for our publishing partners, and make their content look and feel great, and load really fast, particularly on mobile devices. We do a lot of reformatting of content with our publishers’ help, and we’re able to sell these beautiful magazine-like ads. They make a lot more from those ads than from banner ads.”It’s a valid question to wonder whether some of those publishers who’ve partnered with Flipboard felt comfortable doing so because it was an app – a separate digital space on tablets and smartphones – rather than another website.There’s a view that the fragmentation (or disaggregation) of news publishing is inevitable, and that publishers should be biting the hand off clever technology companies willing to share the profits from aggregating their stories in a way that benefits readers.The opposing view –this piece on Talking Points Memo sums it up– holds that companies like Flipboard are bad for publishers: parasitical businesses whose promises of eyeballs and exposure mask a business model that will ultimately only pay off for the aggregator.Related:Flipboard reaches $800m valuation after new investmentIn truth, most news publishers sit somewhere in the middle, and their experiments with Flipboard and similar services are steps towards understanding which of the above theories holds more water. Flipboard’s new website may sharpen their thinking on this score.“We are sensitive to making sure that we do this in a way that publishers are happy and excited about,” says McCue, showing how in most cases, clicking on an article on the new website will take users to the original story. “We’re just driving traffic to their websites.”There’s a but.“But we do think there’s a path forward that could lead to more beautiful content presentation, that’s faster and generates more revenue for the publishers. We’re experimenting with a few publishers where we’ll render their content on the web too,” says McCue.‘We’re experimenting with a few publishers...’He shows a demonstration: a National Geographic article about Mexican mangroves with a fast-loading gallery of photographs.“For something like National Geographic, on the web we’re going to render their content for them in some ways they weren’t able to do before. We think we can improve the state of the art of what’s happening on the web,” he says.“It loads faster, it looks beautiful, and they could have beautiful full-page ads in here that are way more successful at monetising than a banner ad. So we are experimenting with publishers to enable them to have a better experience.”If the pitch sounds familiar, it may be because ofan article in October 2014 by New York Times media critic David Carr, in which he broke news of Facebook’s negotiations with publishers to host their content – albeit for mobile rather than desktop-web reading.“One possibility it mentioned was for publishers to simply send pages to Facebook that would live inside the social network’s mobile app and be hosted by its servers; that way, they would load quickly with ads that Facebook sells. The revenue would be shared.That kind of wholesale transfer of content sends a cold, dark chill down the collective spine of publishers, both traditional and digital insurgents alike. If Facebook’s mobile app hosted publishers’ pages, the relationship with customers, most of the data about what they did and the reading experience would all belong to the platform. Media companies would essentially be serfs in a kingdom that Facebook owns.”Flipboard is nowhere near the 900lb gorilla status of Facebook in this regard, but nevertheless it, too, is angling to host publishers’ content and do a better job than they can – art editors included – of making it look nice, load quickly and make money from ads.“Really what we’re trying to do is set it up so that people can focus on the content creation and the quality of the content. We can then help with the distribution of that to its maximum audience, help them make it look beautiful on web, phone or tablet, and we can help monetise it at a level that’s much higher, so that it continues to support that content creation,” is the way McCue puts it.What about funding it themselves? Now that Flipboard has a platform spanning mobile, tablet and the web, as well as the capability to host articles and sell advertising around them, why not take the next step and hire a few journalists, photographers and videographers to produce original content?Blogging platform Medium is one example of a company moving from a platform to a publisher, with its “verticals” likeCuePoint(for music) andBackchannel(for tech). Could Flipboard follow suit?“We will see how that all plays out,” says McCue. “You could see us partnering with Medium or other original content-authoring tools, and we might do some things that will enable our curators to create more of these magazines. But right now, our focus is on the packaging of this content.”
Boston Dynamics, the robotics company owned by Google, has revealed footage of its latest robot: a miniaturised version of its BigDog quadrupedal bot.Whereas BigDog is a hefty machine built with the eventual goal of operating as a mechanised pack animal for military forces, the new bot, called Spot, is a decidedly more compact affair.The even cuter Spot the Dog, drawn here by author and illustrator Eric Hill.Photograph: Martin Godwin/GuardianInstead of hauling loads over rugged terrain, Spot the dog instead seems to be aimed at jobs such as search and rescue, or forward scouting.Its smaller weight gives the ability to nip along the ground at a light jogging pace, and while it still has the BigDog’s unearthly motorised whine, rather than sounding like a swarm of angry hornets, it’s more like a swarm of mildly pissed-off honeybees. Which is progress, of sorts.Just like BigDog, and the other quadrupedal bots developed by Boston Dynamics, Spot is also remarkably sure-footed. The trial video shows it staying upright despite a few hefty kicks to its side, as well as gently running up and downhill.In a first for the company, the video also shows how they operate in pairs, with one Spot gently nudging another out of the way as they both struggle up a steep slope.As well as the core herd of quadrupeds put together byBoston Dynamics,the firm has also shown strong progress inits bipedal robot, Atlas. That robot, most recently demonstrated in January, is now able to follow BigDog out into the wild: for the first time, it is able to walk for up to an hour using just battery power.What is Boston Dynamics and why does Google want robots?Google’s huge humanoid robot can walk and talk without wires
When a burglar breaks into a home, changing the locks or otherwise shoring up the home’s security is among the first things likely to get done in the aftermath.Likewise, the recent spate of high-profile breaches at companies like Anthem – where a cyber-intrusion has put personal information about some 80 million of the health insurer’s customers at risk – has led to scrutiny about whether it’s time for some relatively archaic digital lock-and-key systems to be changed or improved.The username and password has long been the basic set of authentication credentials that grants access into computer and web-based systems and networks. But in light of recent data breaches, at least one regulator – New York State’s department of financial services, which supervises banks and insurance companies – isreportedlylooking at imposing stricter security guidelines on the companies it supervises. And any decision or mandate from the New York regulator is worth watching because many of the largest banks and insurers have a major presence in the state.Those new measures could include mandating that companies do more than rely on user names and passwords as key lines of defence. Additional options under consideration include requiring the use of capabilities like so-called “multi-factor authentication”. With that capability enabled, an extra layer of authentication is included beyond a username and password – the person trying to complete the login process might also get a text message to ensure they are the right person.That’s one thing that might have stopped or mitigated the Anthem breach, security experts say, since that breach appears to have involved the tactic of tricking employees into revealing security information via phishing emails.However, experts add that even tightening that “front door” on computer systems and networks shouldn’t be looked at like a cure-all – and may not even be the best thing to focus on at all.Bruce Schneier, a leading voice on cybersecurity and board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said cybersecurity-focused regulators and the constituencies they serve, might be better off focusing on outcomes instead of mandating specific security requirements.“Let the companies figure out how to do it. Good regulation regulates the results, not the process,” Schneier told the Guardian.“It always surprises me that people who understand there’s never a one-size-fits-all solution in other aspects of their lives, when it gets to IT, they start demanding – where’s the answer? Well, where’s the answer to burglary? To murder? There’s just a whole lot of things you do. And even then, the murder rate is never going to be zero.”Satnam Narang, senior security response manager at Symantec, agreed that “passwords are the biggest issue”, because they are so ingrained in peoples’ computing and internet usage.“There are people in the industry who’ve said that passwords are dead or dying, but the fact of the matter is right now, in terms of authentication, it’s hard to move away from passwords because they’re so ingrained in everything we do. Until someone comes up with something better, we’ve kind of stuck with them. There are obvious ways to enhance that, like two-factor authentication and biometrics – using your fingerprint to unlock your iPhone, for example. [But] have we solved it yet? I don’t think so.”Paul Kocher, president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, a division of Rambus, says the “reports of the death of passwords have been greatly exaggerated”.“Passwords are horrible from a security perspective, but they are also really seductive for service operations because they are free, decentralised, and supported by all users and their existing devices,” Kocher says. “The problem with passwords, as well as many other security technologies, is that they assume human beings are infallible.”Password alternatives, he said, have worked well for high-value relationships, like employee credentials and credit card payments, but haven’t scaled to the web. The really bad news: while some specific services will have effective security, Kocher thinks the macro trends all favour attackers and that the overall data security “mess” will probably keep getting worse for the next several years.Part of the problem, Schneier says, is that when it comes to IT security, there’s currently a disconnect between threats and the perception of threats. Too many companies, he argues, are under-invested in security and cyber defence.Where he does see the need for regulatory intervention is on the consequences side. There’s a market failure, Schneier says, in that the cost of breaches is often not borne by the entity in charge of fixing the breaches. If a major healthcare provider loses customer credit card numbers or they’re stolen, it’s the customers who end up suffering, he says.But even then, he and other experts say too many companies have essentially told themselves “improving our security doesn’t make us money”.“Too many of them have decided that it’s cheaper just to accept the fraud,” Schneier says. “Security is viewed as a trade-off. Why should a company spend more money than the thing is worth? One of the reasons banks often have such low security is they’ve decided it’s cheaper to pay the losses.”Likewise, security bloggerBrian Krebssays focusing on username and password security is a good place to start, but that protection will be for naught if a company’s data storage practices are lax.There aren’t enough laws, he says, about how much customer data a company can gather or should gather, and how long they should be able to store it.“Authentication and authorization – these are hard concepts,” Krebs says. “Authorizing the right person is a problem that’s hard to solve, and really smart people are out there working on good approaches. In most of these systems, it’s not the technology that breaks down in the way it was implemented. People are definitely the weakest link. Security is about layering on defences – about not putting all your eggs in one basket.”That includes not relying on technology to do the job for you. When Krebs was first reporting on the customer data breach at Target a little more than a year ago, he says other analysts told him that Target spent more on security than almost anyone out there.“But what they didn’t have was enough people to help them man all this stuff effectively,” Krebs said. “And so they missed important warning signs.”

Streaming music firm Deezer is rolling its high-definition Deezer Elite service out to more than 150 countries, following its US debut in September 2014.The company says it brought forward the plans for its global launch after finding strong demand in the US, where 200,000 people have signed up for the service that streams music in the lossless Flac audio format.For now, Deezer Elite will only be available through connected hi-fis made by Sonos, which was also its launch partner in the US.Sonos owners who are already Deezer subscribers can switch to Elite for no extra cost, while people who are new to the streaming service will be able to sign up for its higher-quality tier from 19 March.“We still haven’t set a price for new users, but I would anticipate that it will be similar to the US,” Tyler Goldman, chief executive of Deezer north America, told the Guardian.Related:Streaming music: what next for Apple, YouTube, Spotify… and musicians?There, Deezer Elite costs $9.99 a month for people who sign up for a year in advance and $14.99 a month if they opt for monthly billing. That hints at £9.99 and £14.99 respectively in the UK.Goldman said Deezer Elite’s US launch has been successful beyond his company’s expectations, noting that while subscribers to its standard service tend to listen for around an hour a day, Deezer Elite users listen for double that time on average.“This is obviously a somewhat self-selecting group – these are huge audio enthusiasts so they’re naturally going to be heavy listeners – but the satisfaction quotient is extremely high too,” he said. “65% of them say they won’t go back to MP3-quality music. They’re definitely valuing the sound-quality difference.”Deezer is focusing its energy on selling Deezer Elite to Sonos’s customers for now, but Goldman said more hardware partnerships will follow in due course, as the service is refined.Its appeal rests on the higher-quality bitrate at which the music it streams is encoded: 1,411 kilobits per second (kbps) rather than the 320kbps rate offered by Deezer’s standard service.For now, the Flac streams will not be available on Deezer Elite subscribers’ mobile devices. “Firstly because most phones today cannot support Flac, and secondly because there would be significant data charges,” said Goldman.“Third, most people listening on a mobile are listening on a headset, and although they’d hear a difference, it wouldn’t be pronounced. Also, in the US, we’re seeing for Deezer Elite users that the majority of consumption is happening at home.”Goldman said record labels have been supportive of Deezer’s move into high-quality streaming, enabling it to make more than 25m tracks available in Flac format, out of the 35m in its catalogue.Deezer is far from alone in exploring lossless-quality streaming music. Norwegian firm Aspiro has one service called WiMP HiFi in Scandinavia, and another –Tidal– available elsewhere in the world.It has 41,000 paying users across both services, although Aspiro’s profile is also currently high because it isin the process of being bought by a company owned by musician Jay Z.French firm Qobuz also has a hi-fidelity streaming service available in eight European countries, and while Spotify does not currently offer a lossless option, its chief executive Daniel Ekhinted in December that it was mulling the idea.Musician Neil Young recently launchedPonoMusic– a music-playing device and online store focusing on lossless files. However, Pono offers them solely as “a la carte” downloads, rather than as a subscription streaming service.Related:Jay Z to take on Apple and Spotify by buying streaming music servicesGoldman admitted that in time, lossless may be a standard feature for streaming services. “There are parallels to HDTV: initially people paid more for HD channels, but over time it just became part of your package,” he said.“You can see a longer-term arc in music where Flac may be the common way that files are delivered. In the interim, you’ll definitely see other services offer Flac as an option, but super-serving this audience will not just about the encode rate. It will be about the other features.”Such as? Goldman noted that Deezer Elite customers “way over-index” with their interest in the classical and jazz genres; tend to have plenty of lossless-quality songs either bought or ripped from their CD collections; and often have more than one residence.“There are a lot of things that we can super-serve here. Clearly this is an audience that has different needs,” he said.It’s also an audience that will be crucial to Deezer’s future prospects, as it faces up to competition from well-resourced rivals Apple, Google (including YouTube) and Spotify.Deezer currently has 16 million active users, including 6 million paying subscribers, although a significant proportion of the latter have the costs picked up by their mobile operators as part of “bundle” deals, so are not guaranteed to continue subscribing when those deals run out.Targeting audiophiles through Deezer Elite is one strand in the company’s strategy to find currently under-served groups of people who are not already paying to stream music.“Globally, we’re only at around 40 million people paying for a music subscription,” he said, of the wider streaming market. “That’s still quite small. There’s a lot of room for growth, but it’s important that we continue to refine what we’re doing.”
In space no one can hear you scream, but will they hear you celebrate? Sega’s critically acclaimed sci-fi chiller Alien: Isolation, based on the 1979 Ridley Scott movie, has picked up the highest number of nominations for this year’s Bafta video game awards, earning recognition in the audio achievement, best game, British game, game design, game innovation and music categories.Related:British Academy Games Awards – the full nominations listBehind it, Ubisoft’s open world action adventure Far Cry 4 and Ustwo’s beautiful smartphone puzzler Monument Valley both received five nominations, while Mario Kart 8, Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, 80 Days and Destiny are up for four awards each.The 2015 Baftas will also be introducing two new awards for original property and persistent game. The latter recognises a growing number of titles that feature online multiplayer worlds. Activision’s sci-fi epic Destiny, the space combat sim Eve Online and the battle arena title League of Legends are among the nominees.In the best game category, Alien: Isolation faces stiff competition from Destiny, Monument Valley, Mario Kart 8 and the role-playing fantasy titles Dragon Age: Inquisition and Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor.The actor Kevin Spacey – winner of a Golden Globe for the TV drama House of Cards in 2013 and twice Academy Award winner – is up for his first video game Bafta, for his performance as a despotic private military contractor in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.In all,51 games are recognised across 17 categories. And while major triple A titles dominate in key categories, the list includes dozens of titles from the independent sector, including Lumino City by London studio State of Play (Artistic Achievement, British Game and Game Innovation) and the haunting adventure The Vanishing of Ethan Carter (game innovation, original property, debut game).Bafta is also continuing its “ones to watch” award, which recognises student game developers. Three titles are competing for this potentially career-changing accolade: Don’t Walk: Run, Chambara and Sagittarius.The Bafta video game awards place on 12 March in London, with the comedian and actor Rufus Hound hosting for the first time.

The team will explore how technologies could help people’s daily life for a better future.”Related:Google’s massive humanoid robot can now walk and move without wiresThe move forms part of Samsung chief executive BK Yoon’s plan to finally make the Internet of Things (IoT) – an environment where everything is connected to the internet, creating “swarm intelligence” from individually dumb devices – a reality after being simply a meaningless buzzword for years.Yoonpledged $100m (£66m) in funding for IoT developersand said 100% of Samsung’s products would be internet-connected and IoT capable within five years.“Samsung’s previous success was mostly due to releasing products that are competitive in pricing,” Samsung said. “This is an old business formula. We need to constantly explore new ways to meet the needs of people through innovation and updated technologies.”Related:What is Boston Dynamics and why does Google want robots?Samsung’s revenues in its mobile business have declined as growing sales of the company’s smartphones, including the flagship Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series, have faltered with competition from Apple at the top end and Chinese manufacturers such as Xiaomi and Lenovo at the bottom.The company is likely to look to the innovation centre to revitalise its technology sales leveraging Samsung’s extensive expertise in semi-conductors and component manufacturing.
David Cameron’s controversial comments onwhether the government should “allow” the use of strong encryption technologyfor anti-surveillance purposes have been defended by Ed Vaizey, the minister for culture and the digital economy.Vaizey called for technology firms to “meet politicians halfway” on sensitive issues around privacy and internet safety, rather than react furiously with accusations that politicians do not understand the technology.He said politicians reflect the views of society and to technology companies must listen. “I know that it’s the fashion for politicians to be self-deprecating and say how utterly hopeless we all are, but just as the challenge was not to elect technologically illiterate politicians, the challenge for the tech industry is also to meet politicians halfway. Politicians do reflect the concerns of society as tech becomes ever more prevalent.“So the prime minister, I think, is entitled to say: ‘We have a very sophisticated technology industry and encryption and so on… on the one hand I want to promote those industries and I want a successful technology economy, but I also have a duty as prime minister to keep our citizens as safe as possible. And we need to meet somewhere in the middle and talk about this’.”Vaizey was speaking at a Big Digital Debate event in London organised by techUK, Computer Weekly and BCS – The Chartered Institute for IT, which aimed to give the three major parties a platform to set out their approach to digital issues.Vaizey suggested that the angry response from technology companies to Cameron’s encryption comments was similar to previous rows over the government’s attempts to introduce internet filters to prevent children accessing inappropriate content online. He said: “I don’t think it’s ever helpful when you say ‘Let’s talk about having family-friendly filters’ for everybody to stand up and scream ‘the government is censoring the internet!’.Related:David Cameron in 'cloud cuckoo land' over encrypted messaging apps ban“You’ve got to have a grown-up conversation between the technology industry that is rapidly changing the way we lead our lives and go about our business, and the demos – civil society – about the kind of concerns that brings.”Vaizey later returned to the theme of privacy, claiming that finding a balance between data protection and “snooping” is another area where constructive discussions between politicians and technology firms are needed. “It should be a sophisticated conversation between the technology industry and politicians, who represent the perfectly legitimate concerns of citizens,” said Vaizey.“When you talk about data, people get nervous. When you talk about how you’re going to use data, people get nervous. But there has to be this conversation about how data is being used.”Vaizey was joined at the event by Chi Onwurah, shadow minister for digital government, and the Liberal Democrat spokesman Julian Huppert. The latter criticised the implication that politicians and citizens were faced with a “one-dimensional” choice between security and privacy. “If we get it right, we can actually have better privacyandbetter security. Better businessandbetter data protection. We’re not at the technical limits of what you can have with either of them,” said Huppert.“And so we can go in the right direction: if we can move away from this idea that it must be one or the other, which I think is one of the reasons why the discussion has been so difficult, because it’s been people pulling apart.”Ed Vaizey, Chi Onwurah and Julian Huppert at the Big Digital Debate.Photograph: Stuart Dredge for the GuardianDavid Evans, membership director of BCS, was also on the panel, and agreed with Vaizey that the technology industry could be more constructive in its response to these kinds of debates in the political sphere, citing Cameron’s encryption comments as an example.“The prime minister was saying something about what he wanted out of the tech industry. It is almost … a moot point as to whether that was the right thing or the wrong thing. It is entirely reasonable for politicians to react to what the nation needs,” said Evans.“Just as we want politicians to become technically competent, we want the tech sector to become politically competent. The answer is not ‘You’re an idiot, shut up’ The answer is: ‘That may not work quite so well as you think, prime minister, but we get what you want to achieve, and here is a better way of doing it.’ And that, for me, is a much more grown-up conversation around these issues.”Evans also called for stronger leadership from British politicians in grappling with the implications of new technologies, and their implications for citizens’ personal data – citing this week’s reports thatSamsung’s connected TV software might capture and transmit “personal or other sensitive information”through its voice recognition features.Related:UK-US surveillance regime was unlawful ‘for seven years’He said: “That is in some ways hilarious, and in some ways totally chilling. And as we move in to a more connected world, and the huge proliferation of wearable devices, always-on devices that are going to be processing our information, we simply do not have a good model for how citizens maintain any control.”The question of more technically-competent politicians came up several times during the debate, with Vaizey, Onwurah and Huppert admitting that a number of their colleagues are far from tech-savvy.Huppert said: “There is an issue with how technology-illiterate politicians are. I don’t think that applies to any of the three of us, but there are people across the parties who tend to say rather silly things based on not knowing or caring about technological facts.”He called for technology companies and journalists alike to “put pressure on MPs and candidates from all parties to care about this” in the run-up to this year’s general election, calling for more “selective pressure” to make technological literacy a vote-winning issue.“People can get elected whether or not they say sensible things on these sorts of issues, and it would be really good to have that pressure so that when somebody says something which is daft, they won’t get votes from a large number of people.”Digital inclusion may also be a prominent issue in the run-up to the election, with Onwurah accusing the coalition government of letting down communities that don’t have reliable access to the internet and/or the skills to make use of it, from farmers to benefits claimants. She said: “We are still in the position where so many people can’t get online. This government is sanctioning people who can’t sign on online. And their digital inclusion strategy declares that 10% of people will never get online. This is what we want to change: digital inclusion would be a core part of the next Labour government.”Chi Onwurah wants more support for startups out of London.Photograph: Stuart Dredge for the GuardianOnwurah also called for the Government Digital Service initiative to extend from central to local government, to give people more digital access to local services.“Being able to renew your driving licence online is nice, but the way government will transform the relationship with the citizen – and also save money – is about social care, it’s about benefits, it’s about housing, it’s about looked-after children,” she said.“There are really important services out there that remain to be addressed, and that can only be done with local government putting people in control of and in ownership of their own data.”Vaizey warned that digital inclusion has to be about more than “just talking to your grandchildren on Facebook: it’s about access to benefits and crucial government services”, while Huppert called for it to not be pitched as teaching people to use a computer: “It should be ‘We’ll teach you to do the thing you want to do,’” he said.Britain’s technology industry also came under the spotlight during the debate, including whether the current government’s strategy has been too focused on London’s “tech city” cluster of startups, starving innovative companies elsewhere in the country of attention and funding.Onwurah praised the tech cluster in her constituency of Newcastle, and called for government to “reduce barriers so there is support for startups outside London”, but Vaizey denied the accusations that the capital was sucking up the limelight and resources for startups. “Tech city is not just about east London,” he said. “It’s a cluster network of about 22 different cities, from Dundee downwards.”But the conversation turned to a different challenge: turning these startups – wherever they’re based – into larger “scale-ups”.Related:Ignite flies the flag for first-time founders and startups beyond London“In London we still have a real gap to the second stage of investment in startups: the mid-cap investment,” said Onwurah, who was backed up by fellow panelist Julian David, chief executive of techUK. “A great deal has been done for startups,” he said. “British-based mid-size companies is the real issue we need to address, as we get these startups to become scale-ups.”Huppert took a different angle, suggesting that British startups are not encouraged to take enough risks in order to grow larger.“You also have to get small companies to fail quickly and easily. There is still a problem in this country: we’re not yet good enough at failure,” said Huppert. “We should make it a low-risk environment to try high-risk things, so you can try something, fail then move on to the next thing.”David Evans, membership director of BCS, suggested that there was a “leadership vacuum” on data protection that the UK is well-placed to fill, sitting as it does between Europe and the US.
Hello Tuesday!
1. NIKON D3300£390 WITH 18-55MM KIT LENS SENSOR: 24.2MPThe entry-level DSLR. A guide mode features information on screen. As with all DSLRs, the viewfinder is the primary point of use, delivering fairly snappy autofocus from the 11-point system. Use the rear screen, however, and autofocus is far slower. The large-scale DX-format sensor means quality images, although the lens can easily be bettered.VERDICT: A sensible and affordable DSLR entry point, but viewfinder operation is a must.RATING: 4/52. PANASONIC LUMIX GM1£429 with 12-32mm collapsible lens sensor: 16MPIf small is the order of the day, nothing can beat this palm-sized mirrorless camera. The collapsible 12-32mm lens helps keep the size down. Use it like a point-and-shoot compact camera, pressing on the touchscreen to focus, with Pinpoint mode a favourite for crosshair levels of precision. The big downside is poor battery life. The newer Lumix GM5, complete with built-in electronic viewfinder, is also available, but the smaller GM1 is the choice option.VERDICT: Slip into a large pocket and take everywhere, this mirrorless is small yet mighty.RATING: 5/53. OLYMPUS PEN E-PL7£499 with 14-42mm lens sensor: 16MPBased on the 55-year-old series, the latest PEN takes classic design but adds a modern twist to the now mirrorless camera: its screen tilts 180-degrees for selfies. Performance isn’t left in the lurch for the sake of that feature, with a touchscreen and fast autofocus system, but a less immediate menu system than some rivals. It’s more plasticky than the top-end PEN E-P5, but still sells itself on style, with a variety of colour options available.VERDICT: Not just for selfie fans, also for those seeking something different.RATING: 4/54. SONY A6000£549 with 16-50mm power zoom lens sensor: 24MPDespite its boxy aesthetic, this crams in stacks of features, including an electronic viewfinder that’s a rarity in such a small-scale build.. A larger sensor than the Panasonic and Olympus models is a positive for image quality, although the 16-50mm lens – which is electronically powered, so can be used via the toggle around the shutter, much like a compact camera – is far from perfect where distortion and corner sharpness are concerned.VERDICT: Not the best looks or menu usability, but delivers a full feature set, minus the bulk.RATING: 4/55. FUJIFILM X-E2£749 with 18-55mm lens sensor: 16MPWith an imaging sensor unlike the competition - the oddly named X-Trans CMOS II - Fujifilm is a step ahead when it comes to crisp and clear images. However, it’s not great for action shots, with the autofocus system lacking the same speed of its mirrorless competitors. But an eye-catching design, which is reassuringly sturdy thanks to magnesium die-cast top and front, make it the style connoisseur’s choice. It’s retro chic and all the better for it.VERDICT: Top-notch built quality and great images justify the higher price.RATING: 4/56. CANON EOS 70D£999 with 18-125mm lens sensor: 20.2MPMake no mistake, this a serious bit of kit. Viewfinder use is a given, providing speedy autofocus from the 19-point system for subjects stationary or moving. In DSLR terms it also offers one of the fastest screen-based autofocus systems, made better still by a touchscreen mounted on a vari-angle bracket to manoeuvre through multiple angles. Bigger and heavier than any contender in this round-up, enthusiasts seeking a sturdy, long-lasting all-rounder will be comfortable with that compromise.VERDICT: It is big, but for action shots little else compares.RATING: 5/5
Nearly a third of British 11-16 year-olds say they have been targeted by mean or cruel behaviour online in the last year, but nearly two-thirds say they feel able to cope with online negativity, according to a survey commissioned by the UK Safer Internet Centre.Its report, based on interviews with more than 1,000 young people, was released as part of the charity’sSafer Internet Day 2015event, which has backing from politicians, celebrities and internet companies.The survey found plenty of positives around young people’s online activities, with 63% saying they are closer to their friends because of the internet, and 55% seeing kind, positive and supportive posts all or most of the time on social networks and messaging apps.Related:How do I keep my children safe online? What the security experts tell their kidsHowever, the report also notes that 13% of 11-16 year-olds feel that people post negative, mean, critical or upsetting things all or most of the time on these services, while one in 20 said they feel that people are mean to them “most of the time” online.“The report shows how important technology is in young people’s lives and their friendships: for the majority of them, the internet is a positive place. But there is still that issue of young people that don’t have such a good time,” Will Gardner, chief executive of Childnet International and director of the UK Safer Internet Centre, told the Guardian.“We don’t want to trivialise the fact that many young people are having a difficult time online. We want to use this Safer Internet Day event to inspire young people to create a kinder internet for themselves, as well as showing parents that internet safety is an important issue to be looking at.”According to the report, 26% of British 11-16 year-olds use six or more social networks and messaging apps every week. The most popular individual services are YouTube and Facebook, used by 78% and 74% of this age group respectively.They’re followed by Snapchat (46%), Instagram (43%), Twitter and WhatsApp (both 37%) and Skype and Minecraft (both 32% – the latter game presumably included because children can play it together online).The report suggests that many children are taking action on these services when they encounter negativity. Of those who have experienced mean behaviour, 75% have blocked another user; 68% have supported someone who was being targeted, and 74% have stood up to a culprit.Gardner, who sits on Facebook’s safety advisory board, said that internet services have made encouraging steps forward in recent years to help their users – young people included – take action.“The different services now have safety centres where you can get advice on how to keep safe, and there have been some improvements to the reporting and blocking tools available on those services,” he said.“Facebook reporting wasn’t transparent in the past: when you made a report, you didn’t know what happened to it. Now it has a dashboard where you can track that report, see if it’s been dealt with or not, and what the outcome was. It’s really important that these service providers maintain their users’ confidence in the safety tools that are there.”Gymnast Beth Tweddle is backing Safer Internet Day.On the Safer Internet Day a film – #Up2Us – featuring more than 150 schoolchildren talking about their online experiences will premiere. There will also be an online TV show,SID TV, aimed at 8-15 year-olds and featuring celebrities including gymnast Beth Tweddle.“Beth has experience of getting abuse online, and she was very clear in saying ‘let’s not throw away Twitter because of the minority that are abusive: let’s engage with this medium’. She has made some incredible statements about listening to the positive voices while using this technology, and reporting the things that are abusive,” said Gardner.“And in the film, we’ve got a very inspiring commentary from young people saying that on Safer Internet Day, when they see a negative comment they’re going to post a positive one to counteract it.”Adults are also a key target for the day-long event, withonline resources for parentsand carers including a factsheet and “conversation starters”, and education packs for teachers of primary and secondary-school age children.“Our goal is to try to get a dialogue between parents and children about technology. Just as you’d ask you child what they did today, so you can take an interest in their online lives and the services that they’re using,” said Gardner.“If there is a dialogue going on, it’s more likely that young people will come and talk to their parent if something goes wrong.”Politicians including digital economy minister Ed Vaizey, the Prime Minister’s digital advisor Baroness Shields and Labour leader Ed Milliband are backing Safer Internet Day.Gardner said British politicians have a “pretty good track record” of engaging with the issues around internet safety for children.He cited the current coalition government’s addition of e-safety to England’s new computing curriculum, and the previous Labour administration’sByron review of child internet safetyand creation of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) as evidence.Related:YouTube, apps and Minecraft: digital kids and the future of children’s media“The UK is seen as something of a leader in the area of online safety. We’re very careful not to make this into a political issue: it is something which is relevant to everybody,” said Gardner.“We want to make sure that whatever happens after the general election in May, there is good support in this space for education and awareness work.”He stressed that the positive side of how children are using the internet should be acknowledged alongside problems such as cyberbullying and online grooming.“Young people are seizing the opportunity to engage with new technologies: they’re doing brilliant things, discovering new things, connecting with other people and being creative. That is a positive story,” said Gardner. “At the same time, let’s not ignore the fact that there are some other issues here.”
1. New Spotlight searchSpotlight received a significant overhaul with Apple’s introduction of OS X Yosemite, making it more powerful and useful than ever before. Press Cmd+Space and the new Spotlight search bar will appear on the screen. Just as in the previous version, it’s possible to search through your files in real time, but what’s really useful is it will now do currency conversions, simple calculations and word or phrase definitions. What’s more, the searches provide interactive previews, which means you can do all sorts of things - send emails, make phone calls – right within Spotlight.2.Sign your name with the trackpadIf you’d like to put your signature in a text document at the end of an email or even overlay it on to an image, you’re in luck. Preview now has a feature that allows you to scribble your signature using your laptop’s (or an external) touch pad. Let’s say you want to sign a document that’s in PDF format. First, open the PDF using Preview. Then, click the Toolbox icon in the top right corner. A new Markup Toolbar will appear. Now click the Sign icon, which looks like a small signature and is located next to the Text icon. Click Create Signature and follow the on screen instructions.3.Dark ModeYosemite comes with a Dark Mode, which can be accessed by going to System Preferences &gt; General and checking the ‘Use dark menu bar and Dock’ box. This significantly changes the look of Yosemite. The menu bar and its drop-down menus will now be a dark, slightly translucent charcoal colour. Almost every app you use will now have dark menus. The Dock will also be notably darker, but like the menu bar it will also retain some of its translucency. This is a great feature that can help battle excessive glare from your screen, plus it looks pretty good too.4.New MapsApple Maps is still in many ways inferior to Google Maps, but recent updates mean it might be worth taking another look at what’s on offer. The most useful feature is the traffic option. Open Maps and click the menu on the bottom left of the screen before clicking Show Traffic. You’ll now get live traffic updates on many major roads across the UK, including road closures and road maintenance. There’s also a 3D mode. Click the 3D button in the middle of the compass on the bottom right of the screen and the viewing angle will tilt. For the best effect, you should also click the satellite button in the top right corner. Major landmarks and buildings can now be seen in 3D. Search for a large city, such as London, and a 3D Flyover button will appear. Clicking the button will provide an impressive bird’s-eye tour of the city.5.Rename large groups of filesThis feature is small, but it’s a fantastic time saver. If you’ve ever had a large amount of files that you’d like to rename, you’ll know that it can be tedious clicking on each separate file and typing in the new names individually. In Yosemite, it’s possible to rename these files en masse. Click, drag and highlight the files you want to rename, right click your selection and click ‘Rename X Items’, with ‘X’ denoting the amount of files selected. This brings up a window, which has a list of naming options. From here you can replace the text entirely, add text before or after the original file names or format the text in a number of different ways. For instance, you can index each file and/or add a custom name. So let’s say you’ve selected fifty image files and you want to rename them Photo 1, Photo 2, etc. Simply select all fifty, setup a name and index format and Yosemite will fill the rest in for you.6.Disconnect from a network without turning Wi-Fi offHolding down the alt key while clicking on the Wi-Fi icon on the top right of your menu bar will provide a list of extra options and information. One of those options allows you to disconnect from a network without shutting off your Wi-Fi altogether. This is useful if you’d still like Wi-Fi networks to be discoverable, but for whatever reason you do not want to be connected to the network you’re currently using. In previous versions of OS X you could only turn Wi-Fi on or off from the menu bar, with any additional control or information requiring users to root through System Preferences, which was both inconvenient and a bit of a faff. The menu also displays useful technical information related to the network you’re connected to, such as your Router Security, IP Address, PHY Mode and Country Code.7.Quick TypeQuick Type, which was recently implemented in Apple’s mobile platforms, is also present in Yosemite. For the uninitiated, Quick Type suggests words or phrases that you’re probably going to type next, based on your past conversations and writing style. Any time you’re typing in an app created by Apple, such as Pages, you can press the Escape key halfway through the word or phrase and a list of options will appear, allowing you to select the correct one. This may or may not increase your typing speed, it probably requires a bit of getting used to at first before it truly becomes particularly helpful, but it’s nice to see some iOS 8 features making their way to the desktop.8.Close Safari tabs on other Apple devicesYosemite and iOS 8 saw the introduction of a lot more connectivity between your Apple devices, which Apple has dubbed ‘Continuity’. If you open Safari on your Mac you’ll see there’s a new ‘Show all tabs’ icon in the top right hand corner, next to the New Tab button. Clicking show all tabs will reveal the tabs you have open on your Mac, but if you also have an iPhone or an iPad, it will display any tabs you’ve left open on those devices too. This also works the other way around - any tabs left open on your Mac can be viewed in your iOS device. With this feature, you essentially gain very limited remote control over your Mac, iPad or iPhone. Perfect if you’ve got some sensitive or embarrassing web pages open on your loaned iPad and you weren’t sure whether or not you closed them down or if you want to pick up your browsing from where you left off on another device.9.New RSS and search features in SafariRSS (Rich Site Summary, or Really Simple Syndication) feeds are now particularly pleasant and intuitive to use in the latest version of Safari, which was part of the Yosemite update. Click the RSS feed you wish to subscribe to and Safari will ask if you want to add it to your Shared Links page. Click add and then click the Show Sidebar icon on the top left of the browser, next to the forward and back buttons. From here, you can click the @ symbol and view all of your feeds, including stories that are being shared by your friends on social media, which has been available since Mavericks. Click the Subscriptions button at the bottom to manually add or remove feeds. While functionality is limited, there are some people who won’t need anything more sophisticated than this, which means you might not need to use third party feed readers anymore if you don’t need anything fancy.10. Mail DropMail Drop allows you to send large email attachments by uploading your content to iCloud. Simply drag whatever file you’d like to attach and, provided you have enough space on the cloud, you can send files well over your mail client’s limit. If the recipient is also using Yosemite, it will appear as a regular attachment (even though it is actually on the cloud). If the receiver does not have Yosemite, they will instead be provided with a link from which they can download the attachment.11.Record your iPhone ScreenIf you’ve ever wanted to record your iPhone’s screen, this is the easiest and quickest way to do it. First, you’ll need both the latest version of Yosemite and iOS 8. Next, connect your phone to your Mac with a lightning cable. Then, open QuickTime and Select File &gt; New Movie Recording. You should now be presented with your own face, because Yosemite defaults to your front facing camera. To change this, click the down arrow next to the red record button and change the camera from FaceTime HD Camera to your iPhone. Now when you push record, you’ll be recording your iPhone’s screen.12.Share your screenSharing your screen is a breeze in Yosemite, provided both you and the person you’re trying to share with is using Apple’s Messages app. Open your contact’s message window and select the Details button on the top right hand corner. In the new window that pops up, you’ll see a share screen icon, which is next to the FaceTime and Call icons. Click the icon to share your screen and a request will be sent to your contact, which you can stipulate to either share your screen or to request access to theirs. This is really useful if you’re trying to show someone how to solve a problem they might be having with their Mac, or where they can find specific, buried settings.13. Answer and make phone calls on your MacIf someone calls you on your iPhone, you can answer the call on your Mac provided you’re using iOS 8 and have the latest version of Yosemite installed. This is another component of Yosemite’s Continuity, which seeks to seamlessly connect all of your Apple devices in various different ways. If you can’t receive calls on your Mac despite having the latest version of iOS and OS X, make sure you’re signed into the same iCloud account on all devices. You will also need to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network and be signed into FaceTime. Wi-Fi calling also needs to be turned off on your phone which, if you have it, can be found in Settings &gt; Phone. Making a call is as easy as accepting one, just open your contacts folder and click their phone number. If you find all of this too intrusive, you can stop calls from coming via your Mac by opening the FaceTime app and clicking FaceTime &gt; Preferences and deselecting iPhone Cellular Calls.14. Mute messages in YosemiteHere’s another feature that was first made available on iOS that has now been introduced to OS X. If you still want to be notified of messages but you also don’t want a specific person bothering you all the time, you can now mute individual people, rather than being limited to a blanket Do Not Disturb mode. To access this, open your Messages app, double click the person you wish to mute, click the Details button in the right hand corner and select the Do Not Disturb box.15. Add widgets to the notification centreThe Notification Centre now has widget capabilities, much like the widgets found in the Notification Centre on the iPhone or iPad in iOS 8. On your Mac, click the three bullet points in the top right hand corner on your menu bar and then click Edit at the bottom of the sidebar that appears. From here you can add or remove widgets that you already have installed on your system. You can also quickly access the App Store at the bottom of the screen, where you can browse, purchase and install additional widgets.16. Send and receive SMS messagesThanks to Continuity, any SMS messages you receive on your iPhone can also be read on your Mac, even if the person you’re texting doesn’t own an Apple device. What’s more, you can also send SMS text messages via your Mac using the same feature. To do this, make sure you have the latest version of iOS and that you’re signed into iMessage on your iPhone. You also need to be signed in with the same Apple ID on your phone and your Mac. Now take your iPhone and go to Settings &gt; Messages &gt; Send and Receive &gt; You can Be Reached By and make sure your email address and phone number is selected. Go back to Messages and under Text Message Forwarding, select the device you wish to use. After you’ve entered a security code, you should be able to send and receive SMS messages from your Messages app on your Mac.17. Annotate images or PDFs in mailIf someone has sent you a PDF or an image as an attachment in an email, you can now annotate it without leaving Apple Mail. To do this, make sure you have ‘Include original attachments in reply’ selected by going to Edit &gt; Attachments in the Mail app’s menu bar. Now that this is enabled, click reply and hover over the image or PDF. A small arrow will appear in the top right hand corner. Click this arrow and select Markup. A new window will open, allowing you to add lines, boxes, text, even your own signature to the PDF/image. Click Done when you’ve finished annotating, before emailing your new version back to the sender.18. Private browsingAnother great new feature in Safari allows you to set DuckDuckGo (a search engine that claims not to track you) as your default search engine. Click Safari &gt; Preferences &gt; Search and set your Search Engine to DuckDuckGo if you would like to enable this. While we’re on the subject of privacy, it’s worth noting that Private Browsing has now changed a bit. Previously, Private Browsing was either on or off. Now, you’re able to have a private window open as well as a regular window open at the same time. This is a feature that’s been available on rival browsers for years, so it’s nice to see it finally arrive on Safari.19.iCloud DriveiCloud Drive functions much like DropBox, allowing you to save your documents, music, photos, videos and numerous other apps and files on Apple’s own file hosting service. This is really useful if you like to work across multiple devices and it’s a great way to backup your files. iCloud Drive is located in your Finder window by default, under favourites. Getting your files on the cloud is as simple as dragging and dropping into the folder. You can also save directly into the folder from most of Apple’s own apps. All users get 5GB of space completely free with up to 1TB of space available for a monthly fee.
When theRugby World Cupkicks off in Twickenham later this year it will mark the start of the biggest sports event on UK soil since the 2012 Olympics.Global sporting occasions have a way of turning even the most passive spectators into fanatics and home-based ones have the potential to entirely dominate culture and conversation. For sports fans, September’s tournament will mean five weeks of epic international showdowns; for modern marketers it’ll be the latest major real time event to consider.I was part of the team that led the Cadbury social media campaign of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and now work with the team that helped Adidas deliver itsaward winning campaignaround the football World Cup in Brazil. Here’s some of what I’ve learned along the way:A Cadbury case studySummer 2012 came six months before Oreo’sinfamous Super Bowl tweetreally cemented the notion of real time, but the Cadbury team were no strangers to this reactive approach. The climax of a three year campaign saw the brand’s own social journalists sharing live content from the Olympic Park across a range of social channels, at times breaking news before mainstream news media had even done so. More than that, they took their followers (and millions more who were reached with paid media) behind the scenes of the Olympic village and gave them direct access to light-hearted content that no one else was reporting.This positioned Cadbury as the partner who brought consumers closer than any other to the playful side of the Olympics. Unlike in traditional campaigns the team was able to optimise its approach on a daily basis, using data on how consumers were responding to content to influence where they focussed media budgets and creative efforts.The approach paid off withstrong business and brand results, the organisers declaring Cadbury themost successful digital sponsor.Whilst the Olympics were surely discussed by marketing teams across the world, few will have faced the pressure to actually do something. They will this year. Real time marketing is now seen as an essential tactic by a broad range of marketers, and such a big event certainly does create opportunities to build brands and drive consumer engagement. Here are the three biggest lessons I’d suggest they take on board before jumping in:Event-based marketing doesn’t guarantee you scaleThere’s a big myth, perpetuated by stand out exceptions such as Oreo, that there’s an easy opportunity for brands to get mass viral scale by cleverly reacting to global events. Certainly a large audience is focussed both on the events, and on corresponding hashtags, but the reality is that this makes it a noisier and more cluttered time than ever.Last year’s Super Bowl saw an embarrassing line up of brands investing heavily in reactive video creation only to see that content disappear without a trace amongst the noise. However wonderful your marketing response is, if no one sees it then it isn’t going to drive your business - it’s just as important for marketers to be looking at real time data and adapting their media plans &amp; targeting as it is for them to be crafting witty creative. Cadbury and Adidas had great reactive content but the reason it worked was that they also had reactive media plans to push that content to millions of people, in turn making it much more likely it’ll be further shared.It’s one route to mass relevance, but not the only wayThe true benefit we’ve seen is in how real time allows brands to be truly relevant to millions of consumers’ lives, and to give an inspiring focus to creative development. When your entire audience is thinking about the Olympics, or the Rugby World Cup, if your brand is talking about something completely different it can in fact feel a little out of place in their news feeds.Modern digital tools mean you can create and target personally relevant creative to millions of consumers every single day by gathering and analysing the abundance of data out there, segmenting your audience around demographics, specific interests or even things they’re saying. Even the real time darlings at Twitter have spent the past year trying to convince brands to look beyond big event campaigns to how they can identify everyday moments to increase relevance. Maximising this opportunity again means mining the social data available to marketers: identifying the shared interests of their target audiences; looking for patterns in when &amp; where people are talking about/searching for certain topics; and in turn using this data to target different creative executions at different audiences.It has to be relevant to your brandWhich brings us to this crucial issue: just because you could come up with some clever, witty and relevant content and get it in front of millions of consumers with paid media doesn’t necessarily mean you should. The end result needs to build your brand. Marketers need to avoid the notion that they must do something to react to big events and instead simply consider the possibility that they could do so if relevant. Is the event obviously connected with your product? Does your brand positioning give you a clear, interesting and unique angle on it? Is your actual target audience likely to be paying attention to it? Just as with all traditional marketing, real time needs to deliver on a clear business objective, communicate key messages and help you reach the right consumers. You can begin working out what those consumers really are interested in using insights from platforms like Facebook or Google Search.I’m sure we’ll see some fantastic campaigns and responses to the rugby later this year, but there’s bound to be many more which vanish without trace or get rightly ignored by the general public. These large-scale events are a great opportunity for brands to build personal consumer connections as part of a clear broader strategy, but they must be approached with rigour and ultimately still with budgets;social media marketing has never truly been free.Jerry Daykin is the global digital director atDentsu Aegis Network.

During every minute of every day of 2014, according to Andrew Keen’s new book, the world’s internet users – all three billion of them – sent 204m emails, uploaded 72 hours of YouTube video, undertook 4m Google searches, shared 2.46m pieces of Facebook content, published 277,000 tweets, posted 216,000 new photos on Instagram and spent $83,000 on Amazon.By any measure, for a network that has existed recognisably for barely 20 years (the first graphical web browser, Mosaic, was released in 1993), those are astonishing numbers: the internet, plainly, has transformed all our lives, making so much of what we do every day – communicating, shopping, finding, watching, booking – unimaginably easier than it was.A Pew surveyin the United States found last year that 90% of Americans believed the internet had been good for them.So it takes a brave man to argue that there is another side to the internet; that stratospheric numbers and undreamed-of personal convenience are not the whole story. Keen (who was once so sure the internet was the answer that he sank all he had into a startup) is now a thoughtful and erudite contrarian who believes the internet is actually doing untold damage. The net, he argues, was meant to be “power to the people, a platform for equality”: an open, decentralised, democratising technology that liberates as it empowers as it informs.Instead, it has handed extraordinary power and wealth to a tiny handful of people, while simultaneously, for the rest of us, compounding and often aggravating existing inequalities – cultural, social and economic – whenever and wherever it has found them. Individually, it may work wonders for us. Collectively, it’s doing us no good at all. “It was supposed to be win-win,” Keen declares. “The network’s users were supposed to be its beneficiaries. But in a lot of ways, we are its victims.”Related:The Internet Is Not the Answer review – how the digital dream turned sourThis is not, Keen acknowledges, a very popular view, especially in Silicon Valley, where he has spent the best part of the past 30-odd years after an uneventful north London childhood (the family was in the rag trade). But The Internet is Not the Answer – Keen’s third book (the first questioned the value of user-generated content, the second the point of social media; you get where he’s coming from) – has been “remarkably well received”, he says. “I’m not alone in making these points. Moderate opinion is starting to see that this is a problem.”What seems most unarguable is that, whatever else it has done, the internet – after its early years as a network for academics and researchers from which vulgar commercial activity was, in effect, outlawed – has been largely about the money. The US government’s decision, in 1991, to throw the nascent network open to private enterprise amounted, as one leading (and now eye-wateringly wealthy) Californian venture capitalist has put it, to “the largest creation of legal wealth in the history of the planet”.The numbers Keen reels off are eye-popping: Google, which now handles 3.5bn searches daily and controls more than 90% of the market in some countries, including Britain, was valued at $400bn last year – more than seven times General Motors, which employs nearly four times more people. Its two founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are worth $30bn apiece. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, head of the world’s second biggest internet site – used by 19% of people in the world, half of whom access it six days a week or more – is sitting on a similar personal pile, while at $190bn in July last year, his company was worth more than Coca-Cola, Disney and AT&amp;T.Jeff Bezos of Amazon also has $30bn in his bank account. And even more recent online ventures look to be headed the same way: Uber, a five-year-old startup employing about 1,000 people and once succinctly described as “software that eats taxis”, was valued last year at more than $18bn – roughly the same as Hertz and Avis combined. The 700-staff lodging rental site Airbnb was valued at $10bn in February last year, not far off half as much as the Hilton group, which owns nearly 4,000 hotels and employs 150,000 people. The messaging app WhatsApp, bought by Facebook for $19bn, employs just 55, while the payroll of Snapchat – which turned down an offer of $3bn – numbers barely 20.Andrew Keen: ‘The internet compounds our rage.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/GuardianPart of the problem here, argues Keen, is that the digital economy is, by its nature, winner-takes-all. “There’s no inevitable or conspiratorial logic here; no one really knew it would happen,” he says. “There are just certain structural qualities that mean the internet lends itself to monopolies. The internet is a perfect global platform for free-market capitalism – a pure, frictionless, borderless economy … It’s a libertarian’s wet dream. Digital Milton Friedman.” Nor are those monopolies confined to just one business. Keen cites San Francisco-based writer Rebecca Solnit’s incisive take on Google: imagine it is 100 years ago, and the post office, the phone company, the public libraries, the printing houses, Ordnance Survey maps and the cinemas were all controlled by the same secretive and unaccountable organisation. Plus, he adds, almost as an afterthought: “Google doesn’t just own the post office – it has the right to open everyone’s letters.”This, Keen argues, is the net economy’s natural tendency: “Google is the search and information monopoly and the largest advertising company in history. It is incredibly strong, joining up the dots across more and more industries. Uber’s about being the transport monopoly; Airbnb the hospitality monopoly; TaskRabbit the labour monopoly. These are all, ultimately, monopoly plays – that’s the logic. And that should worry people.”It is already having consequences, Keen says, in the real world. Take – surely the most glaring example – Amazon. Keen’s book cites a 2013 survey by the US Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which found that while it takes, on average, a regular bricks-and-mortar store 47 employees to generate $10m in turnover, Bezos’s many-tentacled, all-consuming and completely ruthless “Everything Store” achieves the same with 14. Amazon, that report concluded, probably destroyed 27,000 US jobs in 2012.“And we love it,” Keen says. “We all use Amazon. We strike this Faustian deal. It’s ultra-convenient, fantastic service, great interface, absurdly cheap prices. But what’s the cost? Truly appalling working conditions; we know this. Deep hostility to unions. A massive impact on independent retail; in books, savage bullying of publishers. This is back to the early years of the 19th century. But we’re seduced into thinking it’s good; Amazon has told us what we want to hear. Bezos says, ‘This is about you, the consumer.’ The problem is, we’re not just consumers. We’re citizens, too.”Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.Photograph: Brad Barket/Getty ImagesOne chapter of the book is devoted to Keen’s lament for Rochester, the home town of Eastman Kodak – a company that in 1989, the year Tim Berners-Lee invented the web, was worth $31bn and employed 145,000 people. It filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Just the previous year, as a timeline at its headquarters records, 380bn photographs were taken around the world – 11% of all the photographs ever taken – and the number of images hosted by Facebook (a business whose model is the monetisation of friendship and whose product is, essentially, us and our lives) was approaching 500bn. Meanwhile, 55,000 Kodak pensioners are out of luck.Silicon Valley talks about the digital economy creatively “disrupting” what went before; Keen thinks a better word might be “destruction”. He insists he is “not a Luddite. I have no objection to the destruction of the old – providing there’s something to take its place. This isn’t a technological issue; it’s a question about the world we want to live in. Look, I’ve sat in the back of enough dirty cabs and been insulted by enough drivers to know the taxi business is very far from perfect. It needs to modernise, become more accountable.“But Uber? It’s a platform. They say everyone can become a driver, but are these jobs? My problem with Uber is not that it’s new, not even that it’s sweeping away a whole old system – it’s that it’s replacing it with … nothing. This is the gig economy. The so-called ‘sharing’ economy is actually dominated by a few companies, worth tens of billions of dollars. Do we really want to live as a precariat, perpetually selling ourselves on one network or other? Take it further: can the internet really replace healthcare, education, government? Can teachers and lawyers and doctors be replaced by a tiny group of online superstars? Some people think they can. They think the internet is the answer. I think the internet is more like the question for our 21st-century future.”Keen confesses to being “perhaps a bit of a content snob, although only in the sense that I value skilled labour and appreciate good content”. He is, he says, particularly concerned by the impact of the internet’s “culture of free” on the creative and media industries. “If there’s no exchange of cash for your article, your photograph, your movie, your book, your song, how else are you supposed to make money?” he asks. “It’s not an original point, sure. But it’s been almost 50 years since the first computer-to-computer communication now; 25 years since the birth of the web. We’ve constantly been told: wait, don’t worry, it’s a young medium, something will emerge … But nothing has. For creatives, this has been a disaster.”Related:The internet is not the answer – Tech Weekly podcastThe number of photographers’ jobs in the US has fallen by 43%, he notes; the number of newspaper editorial jobs by 27%. He cites US singer-songwriter Ellen Shipley, who calculated in 2012 that one of her most popular tracks was streamed 3.1m times on the internet radio Pandora, for which she received a total of $31.93, and points to the 45% of revenue skimmed off all independently produced content on YouTube. Meanwhile, the internet’s inherent “1% model” is functioning perfectly: in 2013, Keen notes, the top 1% of music artists received 77% of all artist-recorded music income. Blockbusters do brilliantly; most of the rest withers.“These new monopolistic platforms are more powerful, more wealthy and fundamentally indifferent to creativity,” he argues. “So I think when we look back, we might see that what we have now is actually lot worse than what we started with. Maybe, even, big media is not as evil as everyone makes out. Publishing houses, record labels, the Guardian – how much money have you guys lost over the past few years? – were and are made up of people who care about quality content, and they’re being swept away. We’re destroying the old, and what are we replacing it with? Anonymous people on Reddit spreading rumours, angry people on Twitter, celebrities online with millions of followers, selling their brand?”Rather than encouraging creativity, stimulating competition, creating jobs, distributing wealth and promoting equality, Keen argues, the internet is in fact doing the reverse. Socially and culturally, it’s the same: “Rather than creating more democracy,” he writes in the introduction to The Internet is Not the Answer, “it’s empowering the rule of the mob. Rather than encouraging tolerance, it’s unleashed such a distasteful war on women that many no longer feel welcome on the network … Rather than making us happy, it’s compounding our rage.”Google’s Larry Page.Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty ImagesNot, he says again, that he would ever try to argue that the web has not helped us to communicate: “Even I wouldn’t dare do that. There’s obviously a huge amount of very real communication on the web.” But he does have his issues with social media.If the “winnowing away” of 19th- and 20th-century industrial society is producing an “ever more atomised, more fragmented, more individualised” world in which “we are all basically our own brands – having to invent and reinvent ourselves because the old associations, the old certainties, the old identities are vanishing”, then, Keen argues, the internet is the perfect platform for us to do that. “That’s what we do, distribute our brands,” Keen says. “With the twist, of course, that in this particular economy, we’re also the product. The illusion of social media is that we want to be social; the reality is we’re selling ourselves. Or, at least, we think we are: actually, it’s selling us. We’re all working for Facebook and Google.”What about social media’s role in organising protest and as a catalyst for change – in, for example, the Occupy movement, or the Arab Spring? Even there, Keen has his doubts. “It may have helped undermine old autocracies, but now it’s descending into chaos and warring tribes just like on the ground. We’ve thrown out the information gatekeepers and what we’ve got is propaganda.” During the July 2014 Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he points out, Israel was employing 400 students to run Facebook pages in five languages, while Hamas’s military wing, al-Qassam, was busily tweeting its line to thousands of followers.Not much on social media is truly social, he argues. “We personalise,” he says. “So, you know, it’s kind of social, but in a very personalised way … One of the most troubling things for me about social media is the lack of diversity. It’s like going to some expensive US college. You only meet people like yourself.” Then there’s the whole privacy issue: “The internet is becoming structurally parochial, like a village. So not only does everyone from the NSA to the big internet companies know pretty much everything there is to know about us, but we’re all clustering in these tighter and tighter little ideological and cultural networks. There’s no serendipity, no stumbling upon random people or random ideas. Everything is pre-ordained; you’re served with what they know will suit you.”Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg.Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesPlus, of course, the internet is increasingly full of angry people. “It’s not that the net made us angry,” says Keen, “but it has become the funnel for our anger. We’re all now in the business of blaming someone else, we’re all obsessed with the meaningless indiscretions of strangers, and we have a platform for it. The internet’s a really great tool for persecuting people we don’t know, who we’re utterly indifferent to, about stuff that is essentially irrelevant. Stuff that, in a pub, we’d forget about in 30 seconds.”Look, he says, at Justine Sacco, the PR executive famously shamed – and fired – after tweeting: “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get Aids. Just kidding. I’m white!” In a pub, says Keen, “We’d say, ‘That’s a stupid thing to say,’ and move on. We wouldn’t throw her out, complain to her employers, get her fired, put her in the stocks to be publicly pelted …”So if the internet is actually the question, what’s the answer? A different internet altogether, Keen believes. Socially, he thinks, we’re all going to have to become “a whole lot more tolerant. Get over this fury at strangers.” But mainly, he thinks the time has come for “the regulators and the entrepreneurs to understand that they have to work together. That this conversation really has to happen; that we have to realise the internet has not been an unmitigated success.”Because there is, he believes, something “quite disturbing, really quite problematic, going on at the root of our culture about this networked world that we’re slipping and sliding our way into. About how we engage with other people; how we think about society, politics, values. There has been a profound, structural change in the way we all do business: personally, socially, culturally and certainly economically. A very major shift in how we organise society. And we all need to wake up to that.”• Andrew Keen’s The Internet Is Not The Answer is out now (Atlantic Books, £16.99). Buy a copy for £13.59 including free p&amp;p atbookshop.theguardian.com.
Twitter has reported a massive spike in government requests for users’ information and requests to remove tweets from its service.According to the microblogging company’s latesttransparency report, from July to December 2014 government requests for specific users’ data rose by 40% on the previous six months to about 2,871.The requests came from more than 50 countries. Twitter said it was getting more requests from countries around the world but three countries stood out: Russia, Turkey and the US.Related:Turkey Twitter users flout Erdogan ban on micro-blogging siteIn the same period Twitter received an 84% increase in government and government-sanctioned demands to remove content from its service. Turkey asked for the most removals, making 477 requests. Twitter has repeatedly clashed with the Turkish government and was brieflybannedin the country last year, after people used the service to implicate the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and others in corruption allegations ahead of local elections.The US made 1,622 requests for users’ information – Twitter gave some information in 80% of cases. The company is suing the US government to loosen restrictions over what it can say publicly about national security-related requests for user data.Twitter received 356 requests for information in Turkey and complied with none of them. In Russia there were 108 requests – up from zero in the last report. Again, Twitter did not comply.“Providing this level of transparency is not without its complications and sometimes means we get tough questions and criticism about our decisions,” wrote Jeremy Kessel, Twitter’s senior manager for global legal policy, in ablogpost.“However, this candid feedback helps us to be evermore thoughtful about our policies and decisions regarding content and compliance as we navigate complex, diverse legal regimes around the world.”
I think it really takes about 15-20 selfies that someone takes on their phone before they post the right one – Kim KardashianI have a “mirror face”. You have a mirror face. Everybody has a mirror face: a snowflake-special screwing-up of the mouth, squinting of the eyes and tilting of the cheekbones done in front of a reflective surface.But also intrinsic to the mirror face is that to everyone else, we look like idiots when we do them.It used to be easier to overlook: the mirror face was a very private thing. It was between you and yourself, and maybe your jerk ex-boyfriend that one time he was brushing his teeth while you were putting on eye makeup and did a ghoulish rendition of how you are pouting (I mean, just for example).Because of the intimate nature of the mirror face, coming across a stranger doing one – in a public restroom, say, in front of a bank of shiny elevators, or in a hand-held compact to apply foundation on a bumpy subway train – has always been a bit uncomfortable. I take it as an opportunity to stare at my shoes; to give the stranger and the mirror face and, above all, the vanity, some space.Awkward.Photograph: NBC/Getty ImagesOf late, though, I feel as if I’m spending my whole life gazing as my toecaps. On Android phones alone, research has shown that 93m selfies were taken every day of last year. And everyone knows that iPhone users are even more vain. The making of the mirror face has gone from being a rarely witnessed activity to a constant one: thrust from the private sphere into the public one by the advent of digital media and the front-facing phone camera.To be clear, this is not a wholehearted condemnation of the selfie as genre: I can empathize with the occasional urge to take one. If you’re on vacation on your own, for example, or need to document an unexpected incident of really ridiculously good-looking hair. I’m not going to pretend I haven’t done it, but I try to take selfies (even writing that down makes me feel disgusting) in my apartment with the blinds drawn, or, if needs must, on a deserted street. Because there is just something so embarrassing about standing by while someone else takes their own portrait.I’m not saying that it’s tantamount to seeing a stranger masturbate. Not quite. But if you’re not the subject of a selfie, it’s impossible not to feel like a voyeur – an involuntary one – intruding on the intense and private creative relationship between a photographer and, well, the photographer. Being in the vicinity is a little mortification whether the selfie-taker has poked you with their fit-for-purpose stick, reshot the photo 17 times while marginally rotating their chin, or asked you to step aside so that they are placed to capture their own likeness in the most flattering light in front of the most striking part of a Unesco World Heritage site.Once upon a time, like in the 1990s, when you were out and about in the world and wanted to capture an image of your out and aboutness, you’d ask someone to take a photo of you. Putting trust in someone else to capture your likeness was risky, maybe; perhaps they wouldn’t capture your prominent chin at the most flattering angle. But it also served as a valuable check: if you felt like a fool asking someone to take a photo of you in a particular scenario, then maybe it wasn’t a photo of yourself that you needed, or needed to share. On the other hand, it also meant that moments that were worthy of a photograph were shared at their point of execution.It’s human to be vain. But it’s also human, I think, to find other people’s vanity a source of excruciating embarrassment. In our moments of most profound narcissism, as we hasten to capture our most flattering moments, let’s try to spare a thought for the innocent bystanders who cringe and blush as we tap our phones. Every one of the 15 to 20 necessary times.
All the top sports team use data these days – and rugby union is no exceptionWhen I started working on data analysis in sport, when I tried to value football players in the 90s before Prozone and Opta, all we had in terms of data was who played, who scored, and basically who was a bad boy. Nowadays all the leading rugby union clubs will use data to monitor fitness, injury prevention and tracking players through GPS. That’s not a surprise: the sport scientists and performance analysts who have come into rugby since professionalism have a background in data because they studied science. However Saracens are probably unique in how much tactical data analysis we do. We have a coaching staff who are strongly wedded to data analysis, and that has a lot to do with the culture Brendan Venter, a practising GP, created at the club. He very much believes in an evidence-based approach to performance and that is what we have implemented.If I am doing my job well, I need to detect the strengths and weaknesses in my weekly opposition analysis that Saracens’ coaches can use in their game plan. They will look at my report, pick up on things, and then study match footage in detail - and from that analysis they will feed tactical insights to the players in the run up to a game. It is worth stressing that everything I do is fed to the coaches to help support decision-making. Incidentally, I read a lot of analytics work, but it can be quite superficial from a coaching view – sometimes you think so what? For example, knowing that more successful teams typically have played together a lot more is almost a statement of the obvious. And you can’t go out and buy shared experienced.Apologies to romantics, but the data shows the kicking game works ...When I joined Saracens, one of the first things I did was to show that the coaches’ intuitions about what was the most effective style of rugby was supported by the data: on the whole, teams that use a kicking game more tend to be more successful. It’s one of the basic principles of effective rugby. Now that goes against the purists who want total rugby, and want to play ball-in-hand rugby wherever they are on the pitch. Well, I’m afraid the data doesn’t support that. The less you play in your own half and the more you play in the opposition half, the more likely you are to be successful.There are really two reasons why that is the case: the more you play in your own half, the more likely you are to be turned over. And the more you are turned over nearer your try line, the more you are likely to concede. Second, the more that you run the ball in rugby, the more collisions and rucks you are going to be involved in and they just sap energy. Incidentally there are certain teams who slightly change the way they play against us – you can see that in the data. Teams kick more when they play against Saracens. The data doesn’t lie.Deep data analysis increasingly provides insights which can help teams develop successful game plansThe game against Clermont in last year’s Heineken Cup semi-final was one of the best performances in my time at Saracens. And I think it was my best performance in terms of opposition analysis too. We knew how vital Brock James was, so I did an incredibly detailed analysis of his kicking game - the types of kicks, when he made them, from which part of the field and the distance he tended to get. Another important element was deeply analysing the key people in their running game.But what also came out was that in the seven games prior to that Heineken Cup semi-final, Clermont had only conceded six points in total in the first 20 minutes in those games. They started very strongly and the way they used the kicking game was huge part of that. They would put teams under pressure, get ahead, and in the second half they would adopt a conservative game of keeping what they’d got. And you could see it in the stats in terms of the types of kicks too. They put up bombs far more often in the first half then in the second half. In the second half Brock James would kick for position, he would kick for territory. He was very conservative. That was fed into the coaches and their plan to combat Clermont’s strategy worked perfectly. Indeed, I don’t think Saracens have ever implemented a game plan as well as they did that day.Data is increasingly custom-made by clubs because it can provide more valuable insightsWith a third-party provider such as Opta, I’ll get data on the outcome of every scrum the opposition has had in the league and European Champions Cup. Opta will also tell you if the No8 had a pick and go from the scrum, or passed, or so on. But Saracens’ internal scrum data goes much deeper because the scrum coach, Alex Sanderson, will analyse the technique of every player involved in every scrum and he will pick up on where there has been a failure of technique. Some of it is comment, but that can be transformed into data because it is categorising the outcome.It is what I call ‘expert data’ because you have an evaluation of technique or decision making. It’s the same with the internal kicking data we use - the kicking coach will evaluate at every given situation how many chases there should have been and go through the video and evaluate how many effective chases were made. Similarly, when it comes to tackles made you’ll get a single figure from Opta, while at Saracens our performance analysts will record several categories of tackles. It all means that we are able to more accurately assess player performance which should help us become a better team.Data is increasingly important in rugby - and the way technology is going that is not going to changeMy academic background is in applied economics and my sporting background is football – I have a Uefa B coaching license. So when I first met Saracens’ coaches their questioned what someone who had never played or coached the sport possibly contribute to a rugby union team. Five years on I am still there, and I have been able to learn from coaches like Brendan Venter, Mark McCall, Paul Gustard and others at first hand. Inevitably I can only see the role of data analysts growing: we increasingly have new technology coming into rugby, which will put more demand on people who can process that data and come up with relevant analysis. But it might be that I am superseded by people who can combine a strong coaching background in rugby union with analytics. After all, I can find patterns in the numbers, tell coaches what the numbers are saying, and pick out where the performance levels are at, but it is the coaches who have the deeper understanding to do something with it.TheCreative Data hubis funded byAccenture.

So I’m a fair few hours into the nautical RPG, Sunless Sea, chugging along on a boat somewhere in the middle of the ocean, tucking into my fourth and final crew member to avoid starvation and starting to think that perhaps my standards of acceptable behaviour has shifted somewhat in the last few days. There are giant crabs surrounding my boat. My terror level is at 100 (“crazed”). My fuel runs out. The lights cut off. My boat sinks.Goodbye, cruel world.The year is 1888. London has become “Fallen London”, dragged down into a sunless underworld called the Neath and is now situated on the coast of a vast, black ocean – the Unterzee.Before setting out, you begin the game with a few options for your captain and an ambition for your nautical career. I have decided that I am a former street urchin and that my ambition is to travel across the Zee to find my father’s bones. I’m not sure what I’m going to do with bones when I get them, but I really want those bones. I am a boy, but I ask my crew to address me as “madam” for the sake of inclusivity. With the suck of an engine, I set off across the Zee in my trusty boat, able-bodied crew by my side, full of the buoyant optimism of youth, ready for anything the sea can throw at us.Several days later I’ve had more screen deaths than Sean Bean and I’ve eaten my way through about10,000 crew members. My first encounter with the flagrant and fairly unapologetic cannibalism in Sunless Sea was when my demonic chef offered me a bowl of “Able Seaman Ayrton, rendered partially as stock”. It’s all going well.Inhabitants of the islands in the Neath range from bizarre (the island of guinea pigs), to hazardous (the island of spiders), to terrifying (the island of postmen). The dark waters in between the islands are filled with giant sharks, giant crabs, giant jellyfish and the occasional giant tentacle stretching out of the deep to steal a crew member.There is a real-time combat element, as you can upgrade your craft and your weapons in order to avoid being bashed about by tentacles and having your boat consigned to the deep after the hull falls apart. The ability to kill sea creatures also has the benefit of providing food for you and your crew, meaning you will hopefully never have to answer the question “One of your crew members has accidentally drowned. Do you want to eat him?” On top of beasties, whirlpools and pirates, the geography of the Unterzee has an interesting tendency to rearrange itself from time to time, making navigation rather tricky.Island-hopping, giant attack crabs, cannibalism and a landscape that keeps rearranging itself, all have a tendency to grate somewhat on any ship captain, salty sea-dog or no, and as a result your “terror” score rises troublingly over the course of your travels. Helpful in-game phrases that pop up, like “YOUR CREW IS DOOMED” and “YOUR SHIP IS ON FIRE” or the classic “YOU HAVE GONE MAD” also go some way towards increasing this. The mechanics of the game are designed to make you return to your home port in between voyages, and going back to Fallen London is a way of reducing your terror score, and refilling on supplies, gathering information and unlocking new quests. You can relax at your lodgings and read the paper, before getting your Ahab back on and launching back out to into the watery unknown.Sunless Sea was borne out of a Kickstarter launched by independent games studio, Failbetter Games, previously responsible for the narratively connected gothic adventure, Fallen London. The game has already been available in early-access beta for about a year, meaning the finished product has been moulded and shaped in a live environment. Its creators welcomed feedback from players, who have spent the last year requesting features and generally helping shape the experience they wanted to play.Related:StoryNexus: building your own adventure gamesThis dialogue with participants is cleverly mirrored in the dynamic narrative of the game itself. Failbetter’s StoryNexus system means that all game events can be experienced in any order, combined with the constantly shifting geography of the Neath, the myriad of atrocities occurring on the islands and the random, horrific events befalling the crew while out at sea, mean that no two games in Sunless Sea are the same.Indeed, one of the best things about Sunless Sea, apart from its beautifully crafted elder-horror stories, fantastically drawn artwork and generally creepy atmosphere, is the feeling that the decisions you make within the game are shaping the narrative, and that by playing, you are writing yourself into that story. So if you end up eating your crew, going mad or being dragged into the brine by giant creatures, it’s your fault, it’syourcruel world.• Failbetter Games/PC/£13.
The new, more powerful Raspberry Pi 2 credit card-sized computer has a small and rather surprising flaw: flashes of light will cause it to spontaneously crash and power off.The curious issue was first spotted by the self-proclaimed “discoverer of the Pi2 xenon death flash” and Raspberry Pi 2 user PeterO, who posted his discovery on the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s message boards.“My PI2 is camera-shy! Taking its picture with a flash causes an instant power-off! I’ve done it three times now and same thing happens each time,” saidPeterO.Related:Raspberry Pi 2 goes on sale for less than £25 – with support for free Windows 10It wasn’t long before the flaw was verified by Raspberry Pi engineer and moderator known only as jdb, replicating the crash.A small gaggle of Pi 2 users started taking pictures of their unprotected boards with a variety of cameras and cameraphones, quickly narrowing the problem down to the brighter Xenon flashes – LED flashes common on smartphones didn’t cause the bug.“With a Canon Ixus 60 (handheld compact camera), its flash reliably locks up the Pi. You need to be closer than about 50cm to make it happen, though,” said jdb.Photoflash glitchAnother user mikerr confirmed that the previous generations of the Pi board were all immune to the “xenon death flash”.Related:Crowdfund this: the Kano computer you can build in 107 secondsThe components, chips and resistors of the Raspberry Pi are exposed, part of its DIY aesthetic. It seems that the chip with a weakness for flashing is the tiny U16 chip, part of the power supply circuit.Flashes of light at the right frequency seem to interrupt the supply of power to the rest of the board, according to another Pi user, tdicola. Attaching an oscilloscope to the board showed that not only does it cause a power interruption when exposed to the light, but also a power spike when exposed to the flash without being plugged into a power supply.“It’s a feature not a bug, it teaches you about the photoelectric effect,” said tdicola.In trueHeath Robinsonfashion, a bit of Blu-Tack or similar to cover the chip solves the issue, whilesugruoffers a more permanent solution.

France has introduced a new law that allows government agencies to order the blocking of websites that advocate acts of terrorism or contain images of child abuse.The legislation was brought in by revisions to 2011’s Loppsi Act, and an anti-terror bill passed by the French senate in October, but can now be used by the general directorate of the police’s cybercrime unit to force French internet service providers to block sites within 24 hours, without a court order.Sites that are blocked will redirect to a page from the interior ministry describing why the action was taken. The sites will be checked quarterly to make sure they continue to display the proscribed content and that the block is still appropriate.Related:France boosts anti-terror measures in wake of Paris attacksCosts incurred by the ISPs as part of the block can be recovered from the French government, while sites can appeal if they have sufficient grounds to do so.The bill was criticised by Felix Tréguer, founding member of La Quadrature du Net free-speech group : “With this decree establishing the administrative censorship for internet content, France once again circumvents the judicial power, betraying the separation of powers in limiting what is the first freedom of all in a democracy – freedom of speech.”Tréguer said: “Website blocking is ineffective since it is easily circumvented. It is also disproportionate because of the risk of over-blocking perfectly lawful content.”Related:Internet filters block websites of sex abuse charitiesThe UK also blocks sites for similar reasons, under anagreement between ISPs and governmentbased upon the system used to keep child abuse material off the web.Media companies can also force the closure of sites that infringe on their copyright via ISPs in the UK, but only through the use of court orders.

When you play the game of cross-media adaptation you win or you die, there is no middle ground. And, unfortunately, when it comes to turning video games into television or movies, spectacular, bloody death tends to be the grim result.Nevertheless, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Netflix has a live-action television series in early development based on the popular Legend of Zelda series of fantasy adventures. The news has, of course, piqued the interest – and unguarded opinions – of gamers everywhere.There are few details presently, beyond the fact that, in common with the role-playing games themselves, the story will involve a hero named Link who must traverse the world of Hyrule in order to rescue a princess named Zelda. The pitch from Netflix is apparently, a family-friendly take on Game of Thrones – which makes sense brieflyuntil you think about it and realise that no one wants to see a Blue Peter version of the Red Wedding.You sort of understand the pitch from a business perspective. Since the series began on the Nintendo Entertainment System back in 1986, it has sold over 60m copies worldwide, with each new generation of Nintendo hardware bringing a critically acclaimed new approach to the format. The game has a gentle take on perennially popular Tolkien-esque fantasy conventions, and the world of Hyrule is densely populated with bizarre and interesting characters. The business development types at Netflix must be looking at Game of Thrones, then across at the success of the Hobbit movies, and thinking they’re on to a sure thing here.At this stage, I just need to show you something. I’ll come back to it later.Are you OK? Do you need a glass of water? I’ll just give you some time.Right, OK, so here are some reasons why it may not – despite all evidence to the contrary – be a good idea. First, of course, is that the greatest Legend of Zelda games are essentially open-world; although they have over-arching narratives, players are free to explore Hyrule, engage in side-quests, and work out for themselves how the worlds function. This interactive freedom is intrinsic to the entire experience. The beauty and majesty of, say, Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, isn’t the central plotline, it’s the opportunity to investigate the components of the universe, to be a part of an eccentric but functioning culture. Of course, all games offer interactivity, but in the Zelda titles teasing out the threads of the main quests by discovering secrets, mini-tasks and seemingly peripheral activities, is absolutely central to the appeal.Furthermore, there is no timeline to the Zelda series – at least not one that any fans can agree on. The Zelda titles flit around in the imaginative space of Hyrule, with Link sometimes portrayed as a fully-fledged warrior and other times as a complete novice. Ocarina of Time, as its name suggests, goes backward and forward, creating rifts in the continuum that Zelda scholars cannot agree on. Wind Waker, its immediate successor, takes place hundreds of years later, while Skyward Sword, released later still, is set before the rest of the titles – and yet exhibits the most advanced technologies (due to the existence of an ancient civilisation that mastered robotics – but let’s not go there).On top of this, you have the fact that each new Zelda title has its own aesthetic. Wind Waker uses cell-shaded visuals to provide a cartoon look, while Twilight Princess has a more naturalistic look, befitting its focus on combat and bravery. Any live-action take would probably have to decide on a single look and stick to it, which would work against the sense of endless reinvention that has made the series so successful as a video game franchise.And live-action? Live-action? Do I have to show you that trailer again? I will do it. I absolutely will.Super Mario Bros, the 1993 live-action movie version of the seminal platform game, was a horrendous nuclear apocalypse of a Nintendo translation. It stands as a nightmarish warning to society for the rest of time that Nintendo’s approach to video games as a visual craft, is not something that can be easily replicated by actual actors. Not even by the wonderful Bob Hoskins and Dennis Hopper. Who would play Link? What would they look like? Let’s face it, Link dresses like the principal boy in your local pantomime production of Peter Pan – which is fine in animated video game form. But on TV?And actually, Zelda has already failed as an animated series. Transmitted in 1989 with a US writing and production team, it ran for 13 obnoxious episodes and was never recommissioned. Link’s constant insufferable refrain of “Excuuuuuuuuse me, Princess” has become a video game meme.Of course, Netflix probably won’t fall into the same traps as Super Mario Bros (which actually survived much longer as an animated series) or the Zelda cartoon. Netflix has a pretty good hit rate with shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Perhaps if the company can take on writers with a similar level of daring, flair and wit, something positive could happen. Maybe.But then absolutely maybe not. Because the biggest problem, as we’ve already hinted, is that Link – the central component of the Zelda universe – isn’t really a character. Link is you, the player. Link is a surrogate, an avatar. He is mute in the games, not because of some narrative reason, but because he is a representative in Hyrule of the player’s imagination and interaction. Even his name suggests that he is there as a parser between player and game.One day, there will no doubt be a really good movie or television adaptation of a video game – better even than Tomb Raider (well, it had its fans until they made the second one) or Mortal Kombat (ditto), and certainly better than Silent Hill, House of the Dead, Doom, Need for Speed or Street Fighter. And don’t get me started on Resident Evil.But Zelda?Zelda? That is a game series so utterly interconnected with player experience and agency, so dreamlike and aloof in its sense of space and time, so open and circular and tricksy. Zelda is the Catch 22 of games; when you think you have it, there is another left turn, another flight of ingenious fancy and your understanding crumbles; logic is just another game to designer Shigeru Miyamoto as it is to writer Joseph Heller.But that is the pleasure and the wonder of it. Legend of Zelda, like the imagination required by players to understand and appreciate its brilliance, is non-linear and elusive. We only ever orbit Hyrule; we never really touch down.
Users of Samsung’s Smart TV devices have raised concerns over the device’s privacy policy, which seems to suggest that they should not discuss any sensitive topics in their living room while the television is plugged in.The warning relates to the product line’s voice recognition services, which lets users control their television with voice commands input through a microphone on the set’s remote control.Samsung privacy policy warns: “Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of voice recognition.”The third-party mentioned is thought to be Massachusetts-based voice recognition company Nuance, which provides the technology to Samsung as a white-label service.Parker Higgins, an activist for San Francisco-based advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation who brought the privacy policy to light,compared the featureto the telescreens in George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984.Orwell wrote: “Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork.”Samsung told the Guardian that the fears were overblown. “Samsung takes consumer privacy very seriously. In all of our Smart TVs any data gathering or their use is carried out with utmost transparency and we provide meaningful options for consumers to freely choose or to opt out of a service. We employ industry-standard security safeguards and practices, including data encryption, to secure consumers’ personal information and prevent unauthorised collection or use.”Samsung said the ability to control the TV using voice commands can be activated or deactivated by the user and that the Smart TV displayed when it is actively listening. Samsung said: “Should consumers enable the voice recognition capability, the voice data consists of TV commands or search sentences, only. Users can easily recognise if the voice recognition feature is activated because a microphone icon appears on the screen.”It added: “Samsung does not retain voice data or sell it to third parties. If a consumer consents and uses the voice recognition feature, voice data is provided to a third party during a requested voice command search. At that time, the voice data is sent to a server, which searches for the requested content then returns the desired content to the TV.”Emma Carr, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: “Samsung needs to understand that not everyone wants to be spied on by their TV. It is outrageous that the company has even stated in its own privacy policy that if the TV’s owner does decide not to share their private information, then the company may still take the information anyway.“This leaves users with no knowledge or control over where your information goes or who has access to it and that is simply unacceptable.“Few people would expect a TV to intrude on our privacy, yet this is increasingly becoming the case. As this sort of technology is being made to gather increasing amounts of data about us, it is vitally important that people should have to choose to make use of these additional services.”Samsung is not the only company to have found always on voice recognition causes controversy. Microsoft’s Xbox One console features a similar implementation, which lets users control their machine with voice commands while playing games or watching television.But the company did not account for gamers’ sense of humour when planning the feature, and soon found that legions of pranksters were endeavouring to trick players intouttering the words “Xbox Shut Off”– which, if said out loud, caused the user’s console to turn off.Worse still, the company decided to advertise the console by demonstrating the voice control features. If any user had the misfortune to watch the adverts through the console, which can also be used to watch television, they would find it responding to the on-screen command to shut down.Apple, Google and Amazon also offer services which feature always-on voice recognition, sold respectively as “Hey Siri”, “OK Google” and “Alexa”.
Mobile games developer Supercell’s Super Bowl commercial for Clash of Clans has been more popular on YouTube than rival ads from an array of traditional brands.The “Revenge” ad aired during Super Bowl XLIX on 1 February, and has since beenwatched nearly 36m times on YouTube.That’s double the 17.9m views generated so far by T-Mobile’s #KimsDataStash commercial, which starred Kim Kardashian, and also ahead of ads from brands including Budweiser, Nissan and Snickers.Related:Katy Perry follows Kim Kardashian by striking mobile game dealSupercell’s ad starred actor Liam Neeson, and spoofed his much-quoted “I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you” speech from 2008 film Taken, with his anger this time focused on a defeat in Clash of Clans.“I don’t know you, BigBuffetBoy85, but if you think you can humiliate me and take my gold, think again.

I will have my revenge … You will regret the day you crossed AngryNeeson52.”Supercell was one of several mobile games firms advertising during the Super Bowl, when 30-second spots around the match’s US television coverage famously cost as much as $4.5m.Developer Machine Zone advertised its Game of War – Fire Age game with acommercial starring model and actor Kate Upton, although it has only been watched 5m times on YouTube so far. Another developer, uCool, ran an ad for its Heroes Charge game.The ads are the latest sign of the growing marketing budgets for the most popular “freemium” mobile games, which make their money from in-app purchases and in-game ads rather than upfront purchases of the games themselves.Supercell made $892m in 2013from two games alone: Clash of Clans and farming strategy game Hay Day. The company has yet to declare its financial results for 2014, but in December, research firm Superdata claimedClash of Clans alone made $1.8bn that year.The growth of these and other lucrative freemium games was initially boosted by advertising on Facebook and within other mobile games, but in 2014, companies like Supercell, Machine Zone and Candy Crush Saga-maker King expanded their marketing activities to television.Related:What is Trivia Crack and why are 100m people playing it?With their games making hundreds of millions (or even billions) of dollars in annual revenues, $4.5m for 30 seconds of Super Bowl airtime – Supercell actually splashed out on a full minute – represents small change for these companies.Were they effective? Clash of Clans and Game of War – Fire Age are the top- and second-top grossing games on Apple’s App Store in the US at the time of writing, with Heroes Charge in 21st spot in the chart.They are also benefiting from follow-on viewing on YouTube, which claims that in the first six weeks of 2015, its users havewatched more than 7m hours of Super Bowl ads and teasers– up from 6.3m hours in the whole of 2014.
Towards the end of last month, Microsoft released a trailer for a new device it has in the works –HoloLens. Declaring “the era of holographic computing is here”, the video is, and I don’t say this lightly, extraordinary. If early reports from testers are to be believed, it creates a realistic-feeling augmented reality. You put it on – a visor you wear over your face – and see the world around you as it really is, plus a bunch of things that aren’t really there: maybe a “television screen” where there’s a blank wall in your living room, maybe a pile of bricks fromMinecraftpiled on your bedroom floor, maybe your friend who lives in Australia, sitting on your sofa. In the same month that Google announced that it wascancelling Google Glassbecause no one really wants constant notifications about text messages in the corner of their eye, Microsoft, of all unlikely suspects, has announced the product that everyone hoped Google Glass would be. You wear it, you look through it, and it re-skins reality the way you want it. This is the future. Can you feel it pressing on the nape of your neck, pushing you forward?Microsoft HoloLens trailer.Gaming is an early driver of augmented reality technology – there’s a reasonMinecraft,acquired by Microsoft last year for $2.5bn, is front-and-centre in that first HoloLens video. When people think about reasons they might want to enter a virtual world, they tend to think of gaming. Microsoft spokespeople have already talked about the “mind-blowing” possibilities for HoloLens in gaming. The previous front-runner in “most exciting virtual reality equipment available”,Oculus Rift(acquired last summer by Facebook for $2bn – the smart money knows this stuff is going to be big business), is specifically designed as a gaming product. You put it on your face and suddenly the gaming world in which you’ve been running around slaying dragons or shooting marines isn’t just on a screen in front of you, it’s all around you. It’s easy to understand why that would be fun.What’s less discussed, however, is what the development of augmented rather than virtual reality will mean for the gaming space, and for our lives in the future.To get our terms straight, virtual reality means you step into the gaming world and all you see is that computer-generated digital reality. Augmented reality is like HoloLens: you can still see the real world, still walk around in it and navigate it successfully, but some of the things you can see aren’t really there. What does this mean for gaming? It means games can be everywhere.The Microsoft HoloLens.Photograph: RexImagine this: you’re waiting for a bus, with your HoloLens on. I mean it’s 10 to 15 years from now, the HoloLens comes in contact-lens form. You’re signed up to play a new spy game. You’re playing it right now. An attractive person of the gender you prefer comes up to you at the bus stop and passes you the secret documents. Of the other passengers on the bus – some of them are real, but one of them’s an enemy agent. Don’t worry, the game knows which is which and will stop you misidentifying a stranger as a target. And anyway the poisoned umbrella ferrule you have to aim for someone’s exposed calf is virtual too. You can’t actually hurt anyone, or yourself. It’s just that you no longer have to experience reality ever, unless you really want to. You can always be playing. If that sounds a bit troubling, I can’t say you’re wrong. And I can highly recommend a movie that was released last year:The Congress. Based on the works of visionaryStanislaw Lemand created byWaltz With Bashirdirector Ari Folman,The Congressis an at times incoherent but often brilliant evocation of, essentially, life after shared consensual reality is gone. That is, a reality we all agree on, one on which there is consensus. In the film, everyone “skins” reality to be whatever pleases them the best. You can know what you’re seeing, but not what anyone else is seeing.The Congress trailer.In a way, it’s going to be amazing. Don’t like the British winter? Why not experience Caribbean sun in the sky whenever you look up? Want to walk to the shops next to your best friend who lives in New York? Sure, can do. Want to hang out with AI-driven virtual people from your favourite game? They’ll always be there for you.Does that sound ridiculous? Consider that we’ve already lost shared consensual audio reality and we didn’t even notice it going. In any city centre, it seems more than half of people are wearing headphones now; we don’t share the soundtrack of the streets anymore. So yes, in a way it’ll be wonderful. And of course it will also be terrible: every new development is a gain and a loss. Enjoy consensual shared reality while you can; my guess is it won’t be here for long.
With a group of “delinquent” girls banished to hell, you play their male warden, shepherding them metaphorically towards redemption and literally towards freedom when the underworld’s prison system fails. The setting is appropriate, as actually playingCriminal Girlsis certainly a hellish experience.One of the laziest examples of J-RPG game design ever seen, this is a level-up grind from the earliest moments. Thankfully, random battles occur every few steps during your trek around level after maddeningly dull level. Unfortunately, those battles are tortuous, with barely animated characters, terribly designed monsters and literally no backgrounds. Mechanically, they’re stunted too, with only one of four girls able to attack each round.Wafer-thin plot and shoddy mechanics are bad enough, but the levelling system is downright offensive. The stereotypical anime girls (see above) learn skills as you discipline them with crops and electro-stims, rendering the game tasteless as well as terrible.
DR JOANNA BRYSONExpert in artificial intelligence, University of BathWhat I don’t like is when people say artificial intelligence is going to take over. As humanity gets smarter, we keep creating these dangers – like climate change, the global extinctions of biodiversity, nuclear weapons. But AI just makes us smarter: it’s wrong to think of it as alien. So the question is: is it possible for us to keep regulating ourselves, including AI, so that we don’t do serious damage? So far we’re doing pretty well. We are able to build safe systems, but we sometimes make mistakes. And no one can guarantee that you won’t do that. But we do we know a lot of ways to make sure it doesn’t happen.NOEL SHARKEYProfessor of artificial intelligence and robotics, University of SheffieldThere are many areas [of AI] which, if handled in the right way, can be very beneficial to us but if handled in the wrong way could sink us. Our job is to work out what the issues are and then take those issues to professional bodies. We can start to move towards guaranteeing how systems are used to a certain extent. But really the consumer market takes over. Once we make a product, and it gets into the wild, then it’s very difficult to monitor what will happen. I’m involved in some problematic areas – I’m part of the campaign to stop killer robots. We’re working at the UN in Geneva. The idea of these weapons is [that] they will find their own targets and kill them without intervention once they’ve been launched. It’s an area that I think should not be researched. We should draw a strong moral line in AI research that machines should not be delegated to kill people.PROFESSOR NICK BOSTROMDirector of the Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford Martin School, University of OxfordIf [super intelligence] ever were to be developed, it should be done only for the benefit of all of humanity and in the service of widely shared ethical ideals. Getting some early commitment into this general ideal is still valuable. Then the hard work of the coming decades will be to ensure that this happens. I think we should start working on the safety and control problem, so that when we eventually do figure out how to create general intelligence in machines, we will hopefully already [have] solved the problem of how to make [them] safe and human friendly.TONY PRESCOTTProfessor of cognitive neuroscience, University of SheffieldI support the pledge, although I’m not sure it will have the intended impact. It may just cause people to worry more. My feeling is that AI will be different from human intelligence. AI already is more powerful in some respects than human intelligence, but in other ways it has miles to go before it can catch up with us. AI doesn’t really have any understanding that there’s a world out there. It only knows the information that it’s given to process. One of the issues is [whether] AI [will] go out of control – I think that that’s a remote issue. The more pertinent issue is that people will use AI for bad purposes. And I think that is a risk – it’s difficult to guarantee that won’t happen, in the same way as it’s already difficult to guarantee that people won’t use computer science in nefarious ways. It’s good to get a commitment that people want to do [develop beneficial AI], and it might be good to fill that out in terms of saying what are the things that we shouldn’t work on that could be damaging and dangerous.DEMIS HASSABISCo-founder and vice president, engineering, Google DeepMindIn the early days of computer science – in the 1950s – artificial intelligence was thought to be just around the corner but researchers vastly underestimated the challenge. Now, 60 years later, AI is still in its infancy but significant advances are opening up a new range of exciting applications. It’s already helping us to create smarter speech recognition tools and translators and in the future it could transform the way we tackle a huge range of challenging areas, from climate science to urban planning. We still have a long way to go but as we get better at making machines smart, we need to make sure we understand its potential. Technology itself is not inherently good or bad but the key is ethical deployment. Through open and collaborative research between academics, industry leaders and companies, we can begin to lay the foundations of the ethical use of AI so we can all benefit from its tremendous potential.
Irish startup Immersive VR Education is hoping to take a small step for virtual reality with a crowdfunding campaign for its app based on the Apollo 11 moon landing.The company istrying to raise €30,000 (£22,000) on the Kickstarter websitefor The Apollo 11 Experience, which uses archive footage and audio from Nasa of the 1969 lunar expedition.Related:Oculus Rift – 10 reasons why all eyes are back on virtual realityA prototype demo is already available for Facebook’s Oculus Rift VR headset, while Immersive VR Education has beenshowing the app at a series of eventsfor students in Ireland, to drum up support.“We have created an inspirational journey that we hope will engage students and give them a better understanding of what took place way back in 1969,” explains the company’s Kickstarter pitch.“We don’t just want kids to read about history, we want them to experience history as a living entity that they can relate to.”If successful in its crowdfunding campaign, the company will expand the prototype into a full app with more detailed models, animated avatars and interactive features, with audio – including interviews – with astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.According to the Kickstarter pitch, players will be able to “carry out the same experiments as Buzz and Neil as you explore the lunar surface” when the app is released in July.The project’s producer, David Whelan, is also chief editor of VR-focused website Virtual Reality Reviewer, whichpublished some first impressions of the demoas the crowdfunding campaign went live:“There is no denying that Apollo 11 is still very much a work in progress. It still needs, at least, to add the lunar landing itself and the return voyage to feel complete.There are also improvements to be made to the existing segments – some textures are missing or could be enhanced and adding more animations would have a big impact on immersion. If you’re not naturally interested by the subject matter then it could be considered a little slow at times, but on the whole it is very well composed.”Related:Virtual reality documentaries 'take the middle man out of journalism'The Apollo 11 Experience is the latest example of VR technology being used outside the gaming sector that was the initial focus for Oculus Rift maker Oculus VR, which wasbought by Facebook for $2bn in 2014.Oculus recently unveiled a new division of the company,Story Studio, which will make animated VR films to be experienced using its headset. Meanwhile, Vice Media is backing filmmakerChris Milk’s exploration of VR’s potential for journalism.Elsewhere, Toyota isusing VR to raise awareness of the dangers of distracted-driving; Oculus rival Fove hasan app that helps children with physical disabilities play the piano; and there have been musical VR apps forPaul McCartneyandThe Who.
In its opening moments,868-Hackdoes everything it can to punish the player. Even with the tutorial, this abstract hacking-themed puzzle game can feel deliberately obtuse. Seconds-long games end confusingly and abruptly, as jargon glares from the screen in garish blocks of neon. But the opening mystery – what is going on? – is a compelling one. Persist for just a few minutes, and as swiftly as it was bewildering,868-Hack’s workings become suddenly clear and the apparently arcane mechanisms reveal themselves to be an elegant, rewarding system. Backed by an ominous soundtrack, the player must move through claustrophobic grids, blasting enemies and collecting points and abilities.868-Hack, originally released for IOS but now available on Mac, PC and Linux, captivates by imposing limitations. Vital resources to spawn points are drip-fed, while moving and shooting is rigid and restrained. Which all makes every move count in a game that is challenging, visually eccentric and a great deal more refined and considered than it first appears.
It could be said that the job of bridge toll collector was invented in San Francisco. In 1968, the Golden Gate Bridge became the world’s first major bridge to start employing people to take tolls.But in 2013 the bridge where it all began went electronic. Of its small band of collectors, 17 people were redeployed or retired and nine found themselves out of work. It was the software that did it – a clear-cut case of what economists call technological unemployment. Licence-plate recognition technology took over. Automating jobs like that might not seem like a big deal. It is easy to see how it might happen, just as how we buy train tickets at machines or book movie tickets online reduces the need for people.Related:Rise of the robots: how long do we have until they take our jobs?But technology can now do many more things that used to be unique to people. Rethink Robotics’ Baxter, a dexterous factory robot that can be programmed by grabbing its arms and guiding it through the motions, sells for a mere $25,000 (equivalent to about $4 an hour over a lifetime of work, according to aStanford University study). IPsoft’s Amelia, a virtual service desk employee, is being trialled by oil industry companies, such as Shell and Baker Hughes, to help with employee training and inquiries. Meanwhile, doctors are piloting the use of Watson, IBM’s supercomputer, to assist in diagnosing patients and suggesting treatments. Law firms are using software such as that developed by Blackstone Discovery to automate legal discovery, the process of gathering evidence for a lawsuit, previously an important task of paralegals. Rio Tinto’s “mine of the future” in Western Australia has 53 autonomous trucks moving ore and big visions for expansion. Even the taxi-sharing company Uber is in on the act – it has just announced it will open arobotics research facilityto work on building self-driving cars.Baxter is created by Rethink robotics and does manual tasks in factories. Needs a human trainer.Photograph: courtesy of Rethink RoboticsThe upshot will be many people losing jobs to software and machines, says Silicon Valley-based futurist Martin Ford, whose bookThe Rise of the Robotscomes out this year. He forecasts significant unemployment and rising inequality unless radical changes are made. Until recently, says Ford, such predictions risked you being branded a Luddite.Based on past history, standard economic wisdom holds that technology creates as many jobs as it destroys and makes people better off by making goods and services cheaper. But, Ford adds, it is increasingly obvious that we are becoming less and less useful compared to machines. Every day, he says, brings new examples of technology set to spell the end of someone’s job. Nearly half of almost 2,000 experts recentlysurveyed by the Pew Centresaid technology will have displaced more jobs than it creates by 2025.Under threat, stresses Ford, are not just the jobs of people who work with their hands but those who work with their minds, including professionals. “Robots aren’t just in factories threatening blue-collar workers,” Ford says. “It is really now anyone who sits in front of a desk doing any kind of job that involves manipulating information – especially if it is more routine and formulaic.”As an example, he cites New York- based startup Work Fusion, which sells software to businesses to automate big projects that would previously have been done by office workers, such as updating company records or extracting specific information from internet websites. The software divides the job into micro-tasks, automates the repetitive bit then recruits freelance workers through crowdfunding platforms for tasks that require thinking. The remarkable thing about the system, notes Ford, is that as it manages these freelance workers it monitors what they are doing and learns from them so, over time, it can automate more and more: “As the freelance workers do their jobs they are, in effect, training the system to replace them. That’s a pretty good preview of what the future looks like.”Of course most companies say the goal is not to replace workers but free them for other tasks. But Ford argues that technology combined with capitalism naturally tends towards making the economy less labour-intensive. Don’t be surprised if it is hard to find examples of people directly losing their jobs to automation like those on the Golden Gate Bridge, he adds. Most commonly, jobs are eliminated during an economic downturn and then, when the recovery comes, employers find technology allows them to avoid rehiring people.Ford’s book isn’t the first in recent times to sound alarm bells. It follows last year’s influentialThe Second Machine Ageby Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, business school academics at the Massachusetts Insitutute of Technology (MIT) Sloan School of Management. They also warned we face significant overall job loss from computers, robots and automation unless we institute radical change. There is no economic law that says technological progress has to result in job creation and shared prosperity, they say. Rather, we are about halfway into a century-long transformation that moves us from merely automating physical work to automating mental work, a process that started with the first computer boom in the 1970s. The effects are just becoming noticeable now because exponential growth by its nature takes time to build up. “Machines are better than humans in many tasks right now, from playing chess to legal discovery to medical diagnosis,” says Brynjolfsson. “That will just accelerate.”TheKnightscopeK5 is a mobile robotic security guard, equipped to patrol and monitor an area with mobile sensors, GPS and laser scanning built-in.Photograph: © Knightscope, Inc. 2015Artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology that allow computers to make decisions, recognise speech and visualise in 3D are the main driver of the process, says Ford. They are leading to the development of both algorithms and new robots that can perform all sorts of previously non-automatable tasks.“Little bits of artificial intelligence are all over the place now,” says Murray Shanahan, a cognitive robotics expert at Imperial College London. For example: automated call systems that recognise voice commands. But what is coming is more sophisticated. When it comes to robots, he adds, most of the automation of manual tasks we have seen has occurred in highly engineered settings where the task can easily be specified for the robot without it having to understand the environment. We have had automation of car assembly lines for decades, but the whole plant has needed to be carefully designed – tools and components in particular predetermined places – so the robots can repeat mind-bogglingly precise tasks. But with AI boundaries can be pushed. Google’s self-driving car, which is essentially just a robot, is being taught to operate in the real, unpredictable world.The question is what do humans do next? When you automate the physical work you still need humans to be the control system, says Brynjolfsson. But when you automate the control system, “then it is less clear what the role for humans is”. Ford comments: “There isn’t another big sector of the economy to absorb all these workers.”Related:Artificial intelligence: how clever do we want our machines to be?The US has experienced measurable net technological unemployment for about the past decade and a half, Brynjolfsson and McAfee argue. Productivity (the output for the labour input), private sector employment and median income have all risen roughly together. But in about 2000 a divergence began, which continues. Productivity has continued to increase while employment and median income have stagnated and even fallen. “I call it the great decoupling,” says Brynjolfsson. “It is a different pattern than what we have seen during the preceding 200 years, [and] the biggest single explanation is that technology has been affecting far more middle-skilled jobs.” Concentrated in the middle it hollows out this group, making things more unequal.To analyse the skills most affected, Brynjolfsson and McAfee categorise jobs as routine or non-routine and then again by whether they are cognitive or manual. The routine jobs – both cognitive (say payroll clerk) and manual (say assembly line worker) – are falling away most dramatically while the non-routine – both cognitive (say financial analyst) and manual (chambermaid) – have held up better so far because they turn out not to be simple and repetitive in a way that can be easily programmed.But they note that the boundaries of what counts as routine and non-routine are moving all the time. It was once thought that driving was a skill so complex it couldn’t be automated only to see it turned on its head by Google and others. Dexterous robots such as Baxter can now do some non-routine manual tasks as well and skills such as medical diagnosis and legal analysis, once thought of as non-routine cognitive, are increasingly becoming automatable.SaviOne is a robot butler that can take towels and food to guest rooms.Photograph: courtesy of SaviokeMichael Osborne and Carl Frey from Oxford University have put numbers to Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s job loss predictions. In areport published last year, they conclude that 35% of UK jobs were at high risk of disappearing in 10 to 20 years because of automation. (An earlier study of the US, which has more manufacturing, suggested 47% of jobs were at high risk). They used a different method for estimating the vulnerability of occupations focused on the extent to which people’s jobs involved three types of task – originality, social intelligence and interacting with complex objects in unstructured environments, which comes naturally to us but is hard for robots. The more a job involved those tasks, the less likely it was to become automated, they estimated.Job categories most at risk tended to be low-skilled and were in office and administrative support; sales and services; transport; construction and extraction; and manufacturing. Among the highest risk jobs were telemarketers, payroll managers and wages clerks, bank and post office clerks, local government administrative occupations, assembly line workers, taxation experts, accountants, retail assistants and waiters.We may even already have seen social unrest as a result of people losing jobs to technology, believe Brynjolfsson and McAfee, citing movements such as Occupy and the Tea Party. “People feel they are not getting a fair deal,” says McAfee. “They blame different parties … [but] there is this tectonic force in the background that I would call technological progress.” Osborne and Frey’s job categories least at risk tended to be high ability and spanned skilled management; financial services; computing, engineering and science; education; legal services; community services; arts and media; and healthcare. Among the lowest-risk jobs were: hotel managers, doctors, teachers, nurses, architects, lawyers, management consultants, IT systems designers, childcare workers, artists and journalists.Not every component of the highest risk jobs may be automatable, says Osborne. For example, we may well make orders on tablet computers at restaurant tables, but staff will still bring the plates. Likewise, some components of low-risk jobs may incorporate elements of automation – algorithms can now write simple finance and sports news stories once done by journalists, for example – but it doesn’t mean those jobs will disappear anytime soon because of the skills they require.“I think a lot of the risk to professions has been overhyped,” says Osborne. “Yes some component of doctoring is going to be automatable, but a lot of what doctors do is interacting with people … these algorithms will free them up to do more of that.” Medicine will be an interesting test bed, says McAfee: “There is a lot of potential for automation but also for resistance from patients, who don’t want to be diagnosed by a machine.”Yet the picture painted by the doomsayers does not resonate with many economists. Jobs will always be “destroyed” by technological change, says David Autor, an economist at MIT, citing how there are not many train firemen (they shovelled the coal into steam locomotives), typists and lift operators left in advanced economies. But this has not reduced employment in aggregate or lowered earnings levels on average. It has done the opposite: raised productivity on average and led to more interesting, more cognitively challenging, better paid and less dangerous jobs.To focus on jobs destroyed is like writing a history of the economic impacts of the motor car that focuses entirely on the plight of blacksmiths and stable boys, he says. “It sows panic without adding to understanding.” Job displacement is highly disruptive and even traumatic for those who experience it, he notes, but in time new sectors open up. (A figure of 35% of jobs at risk does not mean employment will be 35% lower.)Alan Manning, an economist at the London School of Economics, takes issue with the assertion that economic trends observed in the US are caused by technological unemployment. While he agrees US data shows rising productivity and stagnating employment, it isn’t the case in Britain. For about a decade UK productivity has been stagnating while employment, if anything, is up. If technology was having a big effect, he argues, it might show up in US data a bit earlier but wouldn’t be entirely absent elsewhere.“They are citing a pattern that isn’t true of many other of the most advanced economies,” he says. “Which makes me think other stuff is going on here.” The UK’s situation suggests that there has not been too much investment in machines, but too little.Aethon’s TUG robot performs transportation tasks in hospitals.Photograph: courtesy of AethonAll the talk of robots taking jobs makes Gavin Kelly at the Resolution Foundation, a UK-based thinktank focused on improving the living standards of low- to middle-income earners, fret for different reasons. He is optimistic that technology will not end work and is also confident that we are capable of adapting to the big shifts in employment he expects over the next 30 years as technology churns things up. What he worries about is that all the rhetoric about robots might spook politicians into not pushing for better wages.Others note the technology still has a long way to go. Might Google’s showy self-driving car lead people to extrapolate a little too far? There are many tasks we do effortlessly that we don’t explicitly understand, yet those “rules” are exactly what is necessary for them to be computerised, notes Autor. There will still be plenty of room for humans, with common sense and judgment, to complement the work of machines, he believes.Rodney Brooks, founder of Rethink Robotics which makes Baxter, dreams of the day when we will truly have robots with arms that can manipulate stuff. We need them to do all the unskilled jobs no one wants, including providing care for our ageing population, he says. But the technological challenge of making robots dexterous is “massive” (something that doesn’t afflict the self-driving car). “We have a lot of stuff we have no clue how to do,” he says. He cites a problem he calls the “bin of parts”. While a person can reach in to a bin full of jumbled parts and grab the right one, a robot still can’t.In 2010 researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, programmed a robot to fold a pile of towels (videos of it went viral). But it took the robot, which cost $400,000 to buy, 25 minutes a towel, with most time spent working out how to grasp it. The researchers have been working on trying to get it to do a full cycle of laundry, but many areas seem to hamper it.If you still don’t feel reassured, Brynjolfsson, McAfee and Ford offer suggestions about how to avoid being usurped by a robot or lines of code. Just as a bad outcome isn’t impossible, neither is it inevitable.Individuals should cultivate skills, such as idea generation, where humans currently have the comparative advantage, and select job types that are not so subject to the head-to-head race against machines.Recommendations for policymakers include boosting entrepreneurs to enable them to invent the new industries and jobs necessary to replace the old ones and refocusing education to emphasise creativity and interpersonal skills.They all float the idea of basic guaranteed incomes for everyone, or tax credits to supplement low-wage workers.“We are going to have to restructure our economy and society to deal with this,” says Ford. If we did, he adds, we could live in a world where we all have a lot more leisure time. If all else fails, in the words of one prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist, Steve Jurvetson: “We’ll probably make good pets.”
You may have noticed that there’s a lot of talk about the “internet of things” – things that aren’t computers but with connectivity, such as appliances and sensors. Think of an internet-connected lightbulb, thermostat, door lock, washing machine or oven you can control from inside or outside your house. Think of a bridge that can communicate when its concrete structure is starting to show signs of ageing in places that can’t be reached by normal inspection. Think of a car that communicates with other cars about traffic and road conditions.It’s a thrilling concept if you believe in the power of the internet to transform our lives, and connectivity and intelligent (or at least constantly monitoring) systems to improve our wellbeing. And that’s before you get into the question of how many of the “things” might be objects that you swallow or have otherwise inserted into your system, temporarily or longer term. There’s already a system for rotating computer hard drives calledSmartthat often gives you a warning if your drive is ill (drives can fail without Smart warning you, but a warning ahead of time should be taken seriously). What if you could have a similar warning for your boiler, or oven, or your heart?That’s the sort of promise that the internet of things holds, which is why lots of companies are putting serious money into it.Samsung is investing $100m. Meanwhile, UK telecommunications regulatorOfcom has set out plans“to ensure the UK plays a leading role”, noting that there are already 40m devices connected via the IoT in the UK, and that is expected to grow eightfold by 2022.However, while I like the possibilities, I worry just a bit about the implementation. Remember the denial-of-service attacks that took Sony’s PlayStation network and Microsoft’s Xbox Live networks offline at Christmas? Security experts reckonthe source was largely reliant on home routers– yes, those things that pipe the internet into your house – which had been subverted because they all used the same factory-default password, and all accepted direct logins. At which point everyone slaps their forehead and says, really? Did millions of routers ship with a simple default login user and password (say, “admin” and “password”) that people weren’t encouraged to change, or perhaps couldn’t change? And the answer is yes: pretty much all of them do, and you’ll find them listed atRouterpasswords.com, which ought to scare you. (BT’s Home Hub, which is used by millions, is manufactured by Huawei; however, they come preconfigured with a non-default password and internet administration turned off.)That doesn’t mean that there aren’t millions of routers out there whose makers and users haven’t been as careful, though. Oh, and it’s not just routers: the Raspberry Pi, the credit card-sized computer that’s Britain’s most beloved since the Spectrum,ships with root login enabled, using the same password on every device. (So, change that password.)Still, everyone knows this now, and nobody will be foolish enough to ship lots of things with default passwords, will they? I’m not so sure. The internet of things will grow biggest if it has an open structure – if devices can connect to the internet and each other easily. If we have to enter a 12-character gobbledegook hexadecimal password on dozens of devices around our home, we’ll want some pretty dramatic payback; turning lights on and off won’t really do it, will it?For that reason I have a sneaking expectation that many devices will come with default logons and passwords, a default set of open ports, and software that will just about do the job; the only way the internet of things will get big is by getting cheap, and there’s a natural tension between “cheap” and “configured with a unique setup”. Yes, manufacturers can write software that will give every device they make a unique password; but then life for the end user becomes complicated, not to mention remote access.I don’t think there’s a simple answer to this problem, which is why I’m both thrilled at the idea of the internet of things, and a little wary of it. I might be able to configure the things I deploy safely. But will everyone else? It didn’t happen for routers. What happens when it’s door locks, ovens or even hearts?
Simply, the Jamstik is a travel-sized, vaguely guitar-shapedMIDI controllerthat simulates the first section of a fretboard. The position of your fingers across the strings is picked up by an infrared detector, which translates the information into a digital signal on whatever device you’re using. It runs on Wi-Fi, and it interacts with lots of apps such as Garageband. It’s low-latency, responsive: the technology is sound.I started out on a laptop in the music app Ableton, and, once I’d installed it (which took ages), it played well, but having only five active frets, rather than 19, is very limiting. You can switch the octave, but it’s awkward, and I can’t imagine anyone wanting a MIDI controller that you play like a guitar, even a guitarist like me. MIDI controllers come in all shapes and sizes, and beyond the typical keyboard controller, I find it more intuitive to have a very simple pad controller programmed to my specific needs. Set-up is simpler in an iPad, but the iOS app is extremely basic and uninspiring. The Jamstik could come into its own as a guitar-learning tool for beginners, but the app designers have missed a chance to pair it with an engaging, educational interface. Instead there is a confusing, ugly platform and the option to play in “Arcade” mode – pretty muchGuitar Hero, minus the fun.I think the Jamstik needs to figure out what it is. Even the name suggests a purely technical, utilitarian thing, but there’s many more useful pieces of gear out there. One interesting thing about music gear is that, sometimes, something looking and feeling right is the reason why you’re inspired to play it. If they could take this technology and use it to create an instrument that looks and feels inspiring, and that was more involving and less limited, then they’d be on to something. As it stands, I would recommend it to beginners wanting to learn basic chords, but not until they fix the app.jamstik.com, £186Emmy the Great’s EP‘S’is out now on Bella Union
Grim Fandango Remastered: ‘even by today’s standards, it remains a brilliant work’.It is hard to escape the heady air of nostalgia that comes with playingGrim Fandango Remastered, but regardless of happy memories of theoriginal 1998 release, even by today’s standards it remains a brilliant work. This updated edition offers a gameworld that gracefully blends the tropes of film noir, art deco and the Day of the Dead festival. Its star is a quick-talking skeleton of a travel agent for the afterlife, setting off to save a lost soul. As per the adventure genre conventions,Grim Fandango Remasteredoccupies the player with interactive conversations and puzzle solving. It is a particularly fine example of the form, stuffing a sumptuously realised setting with witty, sharp scripting.This remastered update offers a smattering of extras, an understated visual polish and a rousing update to the game’s bebop and big band soundtrack. It isn’t perfect, though, suffering control issues and a few weak puzzles. But whether you remember the original or not,Grim Fandangostill offers a stylish mystery drama that delights effortlessly.
Oh no, it’s Monday!
I’m a big fan of validation. I’m one of those people who likes to know people have read my texts. When I foundSidekick– a plugin that allows you to track the precise moment people open your emails, I couldn’t resist.For a month now, I’ve been getting a little notification in the right hand corner of my screen every time someone opens one of my emails.It works by planting an invisible picture into each correspondence. When the image is loaded, I know the email has been opened. It lives in my browser and works continuously in the background, constantly updating me on my contacts’ activities in real time. At last, some validation to quantify my efforts.Plus it tells me a fair bit about my contacts. For instance, some people, not mentioning any names, re-read my emails up to 20 times. Are they that hard to understand? Some read them at midnight (Dad). Some read them and reply immediately (boyf, good boyf, well done).No one is safe from my email eyes.If someone clicks on a link in the email – say my Twitter handle, my Guardian profile or my blog – I’m notified about that, too. I wasn’t surprised to learn my mother clicks around a fair bit, but I wasn’t expecting to discover a male acquaintance visits my Guardian profile up to five times a day.But hang on – these people are innocent bystanders in a sick clandestine game I’ve got myself embroiled in. Who’s stalking who here?Take one example, where I didn’t get a reply to an email I thought was pretty important. After nine days of stoic silence and, thanks to Sidekick, absolutely no doubt about whether my email had been read (it had – six times), I called the offender to see what she had to say.Instead of asking if she’d received my email, I asked – in a brasher tone than usual – why she hadn’t responded.Stunned, she said: “Oh, er, sorry, but I … I didn’t receive anything!”LIIIIIIIIIIAR, I thought. But, actually, what could I say? “Yes, you did, I know because I’ve installed an email-tracking device on my computer”? Not really. What’s the use of these “email superpowers” if I’m too ashamed to admit I use them?Instead, I began to feel like some kind of email lurker in the shadows of the internet. What if people were doing this very same thing to me?Sidekick isn’t stupid – there’s an option to block people from using it back on you – which I’ve done. British Gas do not need to know I’ve seen my bill and have no intention of paying it. I’m a hypocrite: I enjoy the privacy of replying when I feel like it and lying about why I haven’t just as much as the next person.It’s all a bit too reminiscent of those “thinking” dots in WhatsApp, Google Chat and iMessage – great when you’re the sender, less so when you’re the responder and you start to reply, then stop.I’m keeping Sidekick for now – but if you get an email from me, just know – I’m watching you.
HYGIENEThis will ensure you are utterly kissableSingletons can now invest in the “Mint breathometer”, a miniature halitosis-detecting gadget that has already nearly trebled its target investment onIndieGoGo. Blow into it and the Mint will count the allegedly “volatile sulphur compounds” swilling around your mouth. It then sends a message to your smartphone which tells you whether or not you “need a mint” before you get close up. At a provisional price of £99, it’s an affordable route to seasonal self-disgust.PHOTOGRAPHYCamera that prints – and uploads as wellRub your love in Facebook’s face with the long-awaitedPolaroid Socialmatic, released on Amazon this month for £249.99. This chunky camera has 14 megapixels, a built-in printer and a separate “selfie camera”, so you can capture those spontaneous Valentine’s moments. The camera is powered by Android, allowing you to download apps, edit photos and share them at the touch of a button.DININGCreate your own dinner party, Italian-styleCombining sleek technology with a vintage, junkshop tint, creative consultancyTourdeforkhas published the designs for these adorkable dinner-table accessories on the website of Italian design magazineCasaFacile.If you happen to have any wine bottles or jam jars lying around your house, these 3D-printable trinkets can turn them into Valentine’s candlesticks (vandlesticks).

Are you a gadget fiend or a technophobe?Gadget fiend. Hopelessly tech-addicted and a chronic early adopter. I’ll never forget being in Brazil on my dream holiday when Apple announced the first iPhone. I was so excited, I genuinely considered flying home.Were you a teen computer spod?Of course. I never had aZX Spectrumbut my friends did, so I’d write a bit of Basic. My programming career ended at Fortran 77, which dates me. People were starting to learn C and I thought: “Nah, I’ll stick with Fortran, that’ll be fine.” Like choosing Betamax over VHS.You started a PhD in physics but didn’t finish it ...Thanks for reminding me.A pleasure. Did that make you an uncool nerd or a sexy geek?There was no such thing as sexy geeks back then. Even at university, if you were at a party and mentioned you were studying science, people would literally walk off. Nobody hid their contempt. I was early to get a mobile phone, a Nokia in 1997, and passers-by in the street would call me a wanker. Now they’re an extension of our bodies.Any regrets about pursuing acting and comedy instead of physics?God no. I’ve always loved science but I was never going to make much of a contribution. I’m better off having science as a hobby. Now I feel like Professor Brian Cox makes programmes just for me.How has technology changed an actor’s work?Hugely. I audition over Skype or just shoot myself on my phone and email it. I love the technical aspects of acting on camera. The pace of a film set is dictated by the camera crew. Christian Bale’s famous shouting fit was just an actor getting frustrated by the fact that it’s never about them, it’s about the lights, the lens, the sound. But that’s what I love about screen acting.What’s the most technologically advanced project you’ve worked on?TV shows likePrimevalandDoctor Whobecause they use so much computer modelling and green screen. The challenge is to imagine things that aren’t there but I lack that ability, so there’s usually a middle-aged man with a stick pretending to be a dinosaur. OnDeath In Paradise, I had a CGI pet lizard and had to react to nothing, which was hideously embarrassing.You’re starring in the WikiLeaks-inspired sitcomAsylum.I play a government whistle-blower taking asylum in a South American embassy. The issues are about technology, security and freedom. It made me realise that all these big decisions are being taken now and we need to participate, to speak up. Technology empowers us but it also puts freedoms at risk. We need to think very carefully about what we want to preserve.Do you love or loathe social media?It’s a waste of time. I was an early adopter of everything fromMyspaceto Twitter and I think they’re just fads, like CB radio. They’re also selling your personal data. That’s why I left Facebook three or four years ago.Are you an Apple addict?Afraid so. I had a Google tablet for a while and I liked it but I keep going back to Apple. I got my first Mac in 1984. I’ve got an Airbook, iPad, iPhone, the lot. I love that blend of technology, creativity and design.What are your favourite apps?Shazam’s amazing.Guitar Tuna. But mostly I use the boring ones: banking, train tickets, flights, all that grunt stuff that apps do really well now.Do you ever use textspeak or emojis?No textspeak but my son taught me how to use emojis and now I’m like a teenage girl, every text gushing with pictures of ponies and sharks. And inappropriate kisses, but I think that’s being in showbiz.What’s the most expensive gadget you own?AnEverhot oven. It’s like an electronic Aga with four ovens, so you can cook things slowly, control temperature and precisely time everything. Amazing but horrendously expensive, like buying a car.Do you ever Google yourself?Constantly. About six times a day. Any actor who says they don’t is lying, like pretending they don’t read their own reviews.Have you tried Google Glass?I can’t bring myself to. It’s the styling – an après-ski look, mixed with Data fromStar Trek. I just can’t take them seriously. They look slightly futuristic and that’s a turn-off for me with technology, weirdly. If Apple had made them, they’d look cool and classic, but Google misjudged it. My advice would be to make them wearable outside St Moritz chalet bars. When they look like normal glasses, maybe I’ll be interested. But hey, my mind is still blown by bifocals. And Ceefax.What’s the first thing you’d make on a 3D printer?Something boring but useful. Where 3D printing will really come in handy, I think, is the purchase of lightbulbs and screws. Things that are a pain in the arse to track down and replace. Zipper fobs or Allen keys. The little things – that’s where it’ll find its use.If you could time travel, where would you go?The 17th century for the beginning of science and the Restoration. I’d get right into the thick of it at the court of Charles II.What gadget would you like to see invented?I’m continually losing my keys and glasses, so I’d like the tiniest tracking device attached to them, so I could find them easily. Chip everything, like we do pets. I don’t know why nobody’s done this. It’d save me about 58 minutes per day.Asylum starts on Monday 9 February at 9pm on BBC4
When Galileo used a telescope to view the night sky and became the first person in history to see the moons of Jupiter and other marvels of the solar system, he was bucking a trend. It was the civilisations of the east such as China that were leading the way in technology – they were more advanced than the west and had already invented printing, paper and gunpowder, while being pre-eminent in metals and ceramics. So if you had put a bet then on where science would flourish, you might well have backed the Chinese. But they lacked one piece of technology that turned out to be crucial: glass.Of course the Chinese knew how to make glass from quartz sand and used it to glaze their ceramics. But glass objects were not part of their culture. By contrast, the European glassmakers of the middle ages used it to make windows to keep the wind and the rain out while letting light in. They developed a form of stained glass to create a new type of devotional space bathed in light in the form of Gothic cathedrals. The use of glass to sculpt light was even more evident in the development of elaborate chandeliers for the palaces of Europe.One of the enormous stained glass rose windows in Notre-Dame de Paris.Photograph: JTB MEDIA CREATION, Inc. / Alamy/AlamyThus when Galileo decided he wanted to a build a telescope, he had a rich tradition of skilled glassmakers on which to rely. They already knew that glass could bend light and that if it could be ground accurately into the shape of a lens, a magnified image could be formed. They also knew that by changing its composition they could manipulate its optical properties. This playing with light in the form of a telescope wasn’t so different from making a chandelier.Galileo’s discoveries amazed people, not least because they could see the evidence for themselves, by looking through the telescope to see what was not visible to the naked eye. The late astronomer and TV presenter Sir Patrick Moore used to wear a monocle, and I like to think it was an ostentatious tribute to the glass that gave birth to his profession. Because as well as the telescope, glass lenses had many other uses, not least of which was the invention of eye glasses to allow those like Moore and myself to see a less blurred world. It’s hard to overestimate the impact of this technology; if you look around you to see how many people today need corrective eyewear, you get some idea of the predicament and blurred world that many of our ancestors lived in. But even if you can see perfectly well, there is a limit to your resolution – you cannot see the bacteria under your fingernails and this is probably for the best. They are there though and you can see them with a microscope.Laboratory glassware is a crucial scientific mainstay.Photograph: Ian Logan/Getty ImagesIt was via this glass apparatus, propelled into existence by the invention of the telescope, that we first understood that all living organisms are made out of cells and that there is a whole world of almost unimaginable complexity under our fingernails. Modern biology was born. There is more. During the middle ages, alchemists interested in the transformation of materials used crucibles and opaque vessels to experiment. This was not ideal for many reasons and you get the sense of it if you look down into a boiling pot of water and try to see what is going on – the steam gets in your eyes and makes it difficult, hot and bothersome to inspect the boiling mechanism closely. But what if you could look sideways at the pot, through the material of the pot. In other words, what if you had a glass pot or, as they called it, a glass test tube.Yes, glass gave birth to modern chemistry and this is still evident today. Go into any chemistry lab and what do you see? A room full of glassware; the subject couldn’t exist without it.The scientific revolution that gave us our physical, chemical and biological viewpoint on the world didn’t arise in China, even though at the time it was more technologically sophisticated than the west. There were many cultural differences of course, but it’s hard not to conclude that the absence of glassmakers in the east was a major factor holding back science.Yet for all its considerable importance in our history and our lives, glass has failed to win our affections. If we break the screen of our mobile phone we feel annoyed and let down by this material that we have pressed to our cheeks for so long. When we go to the top of a skyscraper and look at the wonderful view, we do not tend to appreciate the glass that makes it possible.In our homes, it is often the quality of light we appreciate but not the glass itself. Perhaps it is because we look through it, not at it, that has disqualified it from our affections. So if you do one thing today, give glass a pat of affection; it’s responsible for quite a lot of who we are.
Ten years ago, a weekend journey to a friend’s wedding was likely to involve typing a postcode into Multimap, printing out step-by-step instructions and then enduring amateur navigation from your partner in the passenger seat.A decade on, digital maps and the inexorable rise of the smartphone have radically changed how we locate, navigate and plan our journeys. Mobiles, satnavs and computers act as our guides for everything from driving holidays to nipping to the shops.Apps such as Google Maps have become the de facto interface between the the physical and the digital world, meaning people need never be lost again - even if they don’t have a sense of direction.While Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s nascent world wide web supported the first online maps in 1993, it wasn’t until the launch of Google Maps ten years ago today that digital maps began to enter the mainstream.Multimap was the go-to online map in 2005 for the UK.Photograph: MultimapIn 2004, Danish brothers Lars and Jens Eilstrup Rasmussen went to Google with an idea for a web app that would not only display static maps, but provide people with a searchable, scrollable, zoomable map.Google acquired their company Where 2 Technologies - along with a second company called Keyhole developing the geospatial visualisation software that would become Google Earth - and the new team of 50 people set out building Google Maps.Google Maps launched in ‘beta’ in 2005.Photograph: GoogleGoogle Maps launched in the US on 8 February 2005 and in the UK two months later, though by that time it wasn’t the first digital map of its kind: Yahoo had beaten Google to it with a redevelopment of its long-standing Yahoo Maps in 2004.“Yahoo beat Google to web maps and MapQuest beat it to turn-by-turn directions, but people didn’t stand up and take notice until Google Maps came along,” said Gary Gale, the Ordnance Survey’s head of APIs. “It wasn’t the first out there, but the role of Google Maps in transforming digital maps, making them popular and bringing them from a tech niche into the public consciousness cannot be underplayed.”Google Maps didn’t stand still. Later in 2005 Google launched driving and public transport directions, but it wasn’t until the launch of satellite imagery that Hanke saw how committed Google was to the project.“Our aim was to create one seamless, browsable map of the entire world – an Earth that you could browse,” John Hanke, co-founder of Keyhole and vice president of Google’s geospatial division until 2011 told the Guardian. Google’s co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, he said, thought that geospatial – data and information related to maps and location services - was a key element of Google’s organising the world’s information.“At the time satellite imagery was quite expensive to acquire and scarce because there weren’t that many satellites available. I went to show Sergey on the map all the major cities we wanted to acquire. He looked and he just said, ‘why don’t we do all of it?’”Street View was Larry and Sergey’s ideaStreet View has proved to be one of Google Map’s most controversial but popular features. Launched for select US cities in 2006, and rolled out to Europe, Japan and Australia in 2008, the service relied on building up pictures of every street in the city using a specially equipped camera mounted on a car.“Larry and Sergey had toured around the Stanford campus with Larry taking photos out the window of a car with a dSLR camera to experiment with stitching them together,” said Hanke. “That was their idea, but it took a partnership with Stanford and Sebastian Blune to make it work.”One of Google’s Street View cars kitted out with specialised cameras and sensors.Photograph: GoogleEach car was fitted with a range of sensors including GPS, which allowed Google to trace routes and meant the company no longer had to reply on data from third parties.The cameras also captured road signs, house numbers and other data not visible from the sky, giving its maps local knowledge of no-turns, speed limits and other street rules. This was all part of what Google termed “Ground Truth”, aiming to create the most accurate, detailed maps possible.Google Maps debuts on Apple’s first iPhoneGoogle Maps first appeared on a smartphone in 2007 on Apple’s first iPhone - a very different era when Google and Apple were partners more than rivals as they are today.“Smartphones were the key crystallising moment causing people to fall back in love with the map,” said Gale. “Digital maps are essential to everyday life – you wouldn’t buy a smartphone without them.”Google Maps was the default mapping app on Apple’s iPhone until 2012.Photograph: FaceMePLS/flickr“Steve Jobs called me at my desk to ask me to help out on a project – he wouldn’t tell me what it was, but of course I knew,” said Hanke. “We worked closely with Apple to get maps ready for the launch of the first iPhone, which opened up so many possibilities.”Related:Google introduces 'time machine' feature in Street ViewGoogle Maps has since added turn-by-turn satellite navigation, Zagat restaurant ratings, traffic updates and expanded Street View to include Venetian canals and the Grand Canyon - yet progress has not always been smooth.In 2010 it was revealed that Street View cars had also been capturing information about private Wi-Fi networks as they roamed the streets of US and Europe, prompting a$7m fine from US authorities. The service’s expansion into Europe, especially in Germany, also caused home owners to take issue with their property being captured and placed online for the world to see without their permission.“We were doing something that hadn’t been done before,” said Hanke. “People had put up with surveyors going out with range finders and survey equipment, but now cars with cameras were doing the work. It was a learning process for us, the whole idea of photography in a public space and what it means; it was a big cultural shock and we were part of it.”And the competition?Related:Seven urban apps guaranteed to improve the quality of city lifeGoogle Maps faces ever increasing competition. Some, such as popular third party travel app Citymapper, use Google’s own mapping data, while other services have created their own geospatial resources.Apple turned from partner to competitor in 2012, deciding to dump Google Maps from the iPhone for Apple Maps. The company quickly learned that making a solid map service was more difficult than it looked, forcing chief executive Tim Cook topublicly apologisefor the bug-ridden product. Today it is a viable alternative and gaining in popularity as the default maps app for the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers.Bing Maps is the default mapping app on Windows Phone.Photograph: Kārlis Dambrāns/flickrMicrosoft’s Bing Maps was one of the first to improve upon top-down aerial images, introducing a birds-eye view that allows browsers to see streets and buildings from a 45-degree angle.Nokia also acquired the largest maker of automotive-grade map data, Navteq, in 2007 and has been using it to build highly accurate maps which it sells to other companies, including Garmin, BMW and Amazon.Beyond the professional maps, there are also collaborative projects such Open Street Map creating free, editable maps of the world and relying on users to correct things that are wrong in much the same way as Wikipedia.“The mapping war isn’t over, and it won’t ever be,” said Gale. “It’s all about the fight to keep the map accurate and to give it context. A map is never finished, there is always more to be done. Anyone who gives people and business what they want, making it valuable to them will win.”The future of maps is indoors, and offlineField Trip from Niantic aims to use location services and data buried in Google Maps to surface interesting facts and places as people roam the streets.Photograph: GoogleFor Gale, the next five years in mapping technology will be about a new generation of sensors to take over from GPS and mobile phone signal triangulation.“The moment we get cut off from GPS the mapping experience becomes rubbish. We need something to fill the gap for mapping indoors, where accurate positioning is difficult. We’re not clear on what that will be yet – whether Bluetooth beacons or another suite of sensors,” Gale said.The future of the digital map, however, is not actually of the map, but using the map. Projects like those created by Hanke’s own Niantic Labs are good examples.Field Trip, for instance, uses location awareness to notify users of interesting landmarks, features and places in the real world. Another,Ingress, is a location aware game that overlays a virtual playing field on top of our towns and cities.These are the next evolution of the map, humanising and contextualising location to make it more relevant to us.
In LucasArts’ classic you play the deceased Manny Calavera, whose job in the afterlife is that of travel agent, flogging transport upgrades to souls on their way to the Ninth Underworld. The virtuous can afford rapid, luxurious packages, while less righteous souls have to walk, a process that takes four years and involves numerous hellish trials. But Manny’s got bigger problems in the shape of corruption at the Department of Death, and it goes right to the top. Originally released in 1998, the remaster spruces up people and backdrops, but leaves the staggeringly wonderful characterisation intact, with Manny and his irrepressibly joyous driver Glottis still a pair of the most endearing entities you will ever encounter in a video game. By today’s standards many of its puzzles are sadistically opaque, but with a bit of Google cheating you’ll be right back on track with this enduring classic that everyone should experience.ALSO OUT THIS WEEKSuper Mario Galaxy 2, Wii USuper Mario Galaxy was an almost unassailably ingenious 3D platform game that placed Nintendo’s moustachioed plumber in a constellation of little planetoids, each one a separate world with distinct rules and challenges. Its sequel had no right to be any good, let alone turn out to be the standout piece it is. Super Mario Galaxy 2 came out on Nintendo Wii nearly five years ago, and arrives on Wii U unchanged. It’s as spectacularly fresh as it was in 2010, building on the radical invention of its predecessor and somehow managing to proffer all sorts of new delights, from the way the game’s introductory sequence gradually emerges into 3D, to the enormous volume of secrets, with even the simplest-looking level yielding manifold extra lives, bonuses and little one-off touches.Nintendo, £17.99Dying Light, PS4, Xbox One &amp; PCDying Light is made by the same people as the bafflingly successful Dead Island, a lacklustre zombie game in which you aimlessly thrash your way through hordes of shuffling undead, using pathetically fragile household objects. Dying Light retains the zombies, flailing combat and weapons that break after a surprisingly small number of encounters with rotting skulls. It’s a feature made more annoying by your enemies’ stubborn resistance to being bludgeoned back to eternal rest, forcing you to plough through countless baseball bats, claw hammers and electrified shovels. The game, therefore, involves a lot of running away, using the hero’s much vaunted parkour skills to vault walls, fences and slower-moving zombies. It has a couple of scares, but that doesn’t make up for the non-existent plot and endless, mind-numbing fetch errands.Warner Bros, £24.99-£49.99
The Alfa Romeo Mito QV is a relaunch of the moderately popular Cloverleaf Mito, and has a big sister, theGiulietta. QV stands for whatever the Italian is for “green four-leafed clover”, so as its driver one is presumably meant to consider oneself lucky. I dare to imagine the driver of the bigger sister is luckier than the small one, which felt as fortunate as being left with the second-to-last shopping trolley in a supermarket car park.This car can’t decide whether it wants to look cute (small, round edges) or butch (brushed steel, headlamps like narrowed eyes). So it looks neither, and in a charm contest with a Mini, would come a poor second. The cabin looks OK, but the seats deliver a weird driving posture: you’re too far away or too far forward. The steering is a bit premenstrual, at times wildly touchy, at others morose and unresponsive. (I’m allowed to say that because I’m a feminist. If Jeremy Clarkson said it, I would troll him. I know! Life isn’t fair.) This makes navigating slightly dishevelled country roads in the dark genuinely hairy.And God, the noise; it claims 0 to 62 in 7.3 seconds, but I never got any sense of such acceleration, partly because it made such a fuss at the touch of the gas that it seemed mean to push it, like flogging a donkey. It was all gong and no dinner.The 1.4 turbo engine left a neutral impression – neither “How does it manage to be so zingy?”, nor “What did it do with the turbo?” If I wouldn’t recommend it for rural driving, it was fine on a motorway. Dual-clutch transmission is supposed to offer the best of manual and automatic; the idea is to change gears without interrupting the power flow (stop me if you’ve heard all this), so avoiding that pause-for-breath that manual drivers find unnerving about automatics, yet automatic drivers get used to pretty fast. It does move smoothly, but that’s offset by the melodramatic resonance. It’s reliable, though – I never felt as though I might get into a lane-changing fix where I’d overestimated my own coolness and annoyed the person behind me.City driving is just a bit blah in this, with little potential for showing off, either with the exterior or with the performance. It is what it is: a car capable of a certain amount, but that nobody would call enthusiastic.• Follow Zoe onTwitterAlfa Romeo Mito QVPricefrom £20,210 (as tested £25,020)Top speed136mphAcceleration0-62mph in 7.3 secondsCombined fuel consumption52.3mpgCO2 emissions124/kmEco rating7/10Cool rating5/10
Bankrupt at the age of 93, the store that onceproclaimeditself “America’s #1 Electronics Store – Nobody Compares!” willshutter its shopsand declare its chapter over in the saga of technology of the past century.RadioShack, maybe more than any other American company, has charted the history of modern technology even through the store’s messy, prolonged demise. More than a decade after its first shop opened in Boston in 1921 to sell radios to ship captains who had small radio houses on board their vessels, RadioShack’s first catalogue advertised radios alongside the latest microphones, record players and and “custom built Taylor Tubes”.RadioShack 1939Photograph: RadioShackCatalogs.comThe first world war had picked up the inventions of Edison, Bell, Marconi and Tesla and turned them into the accessories of modern life, lighting prohibitionists’ meetings and speakeasies alike, accelerating communication across the Atlantic and recording theblues, folk and jazzmusic of the time.War and the depression redirected the attentions of retailers, but by 1945, “New England’s oldest amateur distributor” was back with an expanded inventory, sellingoscilloscopes,telegraph apparatuses, and the usual Hallicrafter radio equipment.A decade later and tube testers andEico Kitswere more in vogue, along with smaller “amateur radio” and “economy-king radios”,handheld microphones, and “indoor-outdoor-portable-mobile systemsfor schools, stadiums, rallies, entertainment”. People turned towns into suburbs and suburbs into advertisements for capitalism: Americans started living large, and few home accessories were larger than home sound systems in the 1950s.RadioShack 1945Photograph: RadioShackCatalogs.comRadioShack knew it had a good thing going by the 60s: its ads showed casual and cool domestic bliss thanks to the latest in sound, as couples enjoyed their dandy portable FM-AM 9-Transistor radios on the beach, at the backyard grill or even in the family station wagon. The company expanded into “console organs” (keyboards) andtrombones, electricguitarsand table-sized “stereo phono consoles”.The most technologically adept of neighbors installed “Talk-A-Phone Intercom Systems” to ward off the hippies at the door and climbed on to roofs to straighten antennas thatoffered“maximum reception on all channels 2 to 13”.In that (technologically) simpler world, freshly elected president Richard Nixon had no idea how much trouble anewly accessible tape recorderwould later cause him. Slowly, the United States became not just connected by wires hanging between poles and cords linking outlets to phones and televisions, but also wired through and through and recorded with electronics that RadioShack supplied.In the 1970s, RadioShack came into its own. It sold the first all-electronic calculator in 1972 and“high-velocity” headphonesin 1976, and struck it huge with the first CB radios that people could install in their cars.RadioShack 1976Photograph: RadioShackCatalogs.comDuring a decade when the paranoid hangover of the 60s reigned side by side with disco balls, sideburns, David Bowie and Cher, Walkie Talkieschangedthe lives of buzz-cut neighbors, anddecorative “Fiber Optics” lightingadded shimmering decor to basements and bachelor pads across the land. Some RadioShack inventor first conceivedthe science fair kitsthat would survive several generations.In 1977, the year of Star Wars andprimitive descendants of Pong, RadioShack sold its first TRS-80, one of the earliest mass-produced computers that ran on an operating system designed by a mop-haired lad named Bill Gates, who also happened to be arrested that year for a traffic violation in New Mexico. RadioShack was ready to sell everything.RadioShack 1989Photograph: RadioShackCatalogs.comAnd so it did during its heydays in 1980s USA. The Walkman. Boomboxes.Supertape cassettes.Mini-tape recorders. Massivemobile phonesthat could be lugged by handle and eventually equipped with foot-long antennas.Color computing for the entire family.If it could be remote-controlled, RadioShack would sell it: cars, tanks, monster trucks, skateboards, robots and a “battle iron claw for action-grabbing fun”. The VHScamcorder. Modern technology was no longer a novelty – it was the way things got done: finance, phones, music, entertainment, home and hearth itself. The future was computers and cordless and possibly robots, too.RadioShack rode that wave of gadgetry into the 1990s, selling joysticks, beepers, CD players, and the essential VCRs even as competitors like Best Buy and Circuit City rose up out of the 80s with them. Americans wanted cordless phones and Game Boys, and RadioShack and its increasing fellows were happy to provide.But as the decade went on, Americans’ appetite grew for technology that developed faster than shelves could empty. Intel, IBM and Microsoft learned to sell computers for themselves. The internet crept into common consciousness, and RadioShack, rather than try to join the next leap forward, stuck with retail and abandoned manufacturing and development. The Nokiaringtone, the Brian Eno-composedarpeggio and dingthat opened Windows 95, and eventually thelowing “bong”of the Mac all sounded the death knell for RadioShack.RadioShack 1987.Photograph: RadioShackCatalogs.comThe new millennium did not go well. Technology changed too quickly, Apple introduced the smartphone, e-retailers swept through the market, and RadioShack gave up its quirky penchant for following American culture.An attempt to rebrand the company “the Shack” evoked images of rural outhouses more than cutting-edge technology in consumers’ minds, and by 2014, a former employee found time to composea long “eulogy”for the company and its “unsellable crap”. Anostalgia-fueled ad campaignfailed to rouse old passion for the increasingly ramshackle retailers, and eventually its ownership realized the end had come.RadioShack’s long story ended in a new century as messy and marked by technology as the retailer had been at its highest success: a bizarre collection of America’s most advanced contraptions and its most trivial and weird diversions, and all of it for sale. Unfortunately for the retailer, Americans outpaced it in both ingenuity and consumption, with no heed for the fact that RadioShack had helped wire their world together.All photo credit goes toRadioShackCatalogs.com, which carries facsimiles of just about all the company’s annual catalogues.
Emoji and emoticons are not the same thing and the continued confusion of the two will not stand.In the New York Times, under the headline “At Silk Road Trial, Lawyers Fight to Include Evidence They Call Vital: Emoji”, the two were treated as interchangeable.“At issue” in the court’s debates “was a piece of information that [the Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s] lawyer suggested was critically important, yet was omitted by federal prosecutors: an emoji.“And not just any emoji, or emoticon, as the symbol is sometimes called — it was the gold standard. A version of a smiley face.”And on the BBC, under the headline “Emoticons in texts can rack up huge bills” is a news story which exclusively discusses emoji.Anemoticonis a typographic display of a facial representation, used to convey emotion in a text only medium. Like so:;-)Invented multiple times over human history, its internet-era genesis is widely considered to have occurred in September 1982, when computer scientist Scott Fahlman suggested to the Carnegie Mellon University message board that :-) and :-( could be used to distinguish jokes from serious statements online. Shortly thereafter came the name, a portmanteau of the phrase “emotion icon”.In contrast to the grassroots creation of the emoticon,emojiwere created in the late 1990s by NTT DoCoMo, the Japanese communications firm. The name is a contraction of the wordseandmoji, which roughly translates to pictograph.Unlike emoticons, emoji are actual pictures, of everything from a set of painted nails (💅) to a slightly whimsical ghost (👻). And where emoticons were invented to portray emotion in environments where nothing but basic text is available, emoji are actually extensions to the character set used by most operating systems today, Unicode.In essence, emoji are treated by the computer as letters from a non-western language, in much the same way as Japanese and Chinese characters are. But that also means that the software has to explicitly support them – otherwise it is forced to display a placeholder icon, or even just a blank space (which you might see between the brackets in the paragraph above if your browser doesn’t support emoji).It also means that each company has to provide its own interpretations of what the emoji descriptions should actually look like – and they don’t always agree. Take the implementations of the “dancer” emoji: for Twitter and Apple, it’s a female flamenco dancer. But for Google, it was, until recently, a John Travolta lookalike dancing disco style. And now it’s a weird blobby thing. So if you’re about to tell someone “you look gorgeous, like a 💃”, make sure they aren’t reading it on a new Android phone.A smattering of dancer emoji.Photograph: Guardian compositeTo complicate matters, some emoji are also emoticons. The standard for the characters breaks them apart into sets by theme. Most are filed under “Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs”, but the emoji which depict emotive faces are separated out as “emoticons”.There’s more.Although the name’s not much used in the west, it’s probably best to distinguishkaomojifrom emoticons in general. Independently invented around the same time as emoticons, they make the most of the fuller character set necessary to write in Japanese, and can be read head-on. They may be as simple as (*_*), or as complex as (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧. or ಠ_ಠ.Oh, and then there’sstickers, the custom pictures used in a number of instant messaging clients such as Facebook Messenger or Line. Some apps refer to them as emoji, but they’re fully specific to the app, and can’t be cut and paste anywhere else except when they’re treated as an image.With that much variation, is it surprising that people get a little (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ if you confuse :-) with 😃?
