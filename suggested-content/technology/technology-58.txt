Teenagers and celebrities are up in arms after photo sharing appInstagramscrubbed millions of spam accounts and bots.The crackdown has been called the “Instagram Rapture” or “Instagram Purge” as accounts dropped thousands, and even millions, of followers overnight.Celebrities hit the hardest includeJustin Bieber, who lost a whopping 3.5 million followers, while hip hop starAkonlost more than half almost 56% of his Instagram chums.Other music stars whose follower count plunged were rappersTygaand Ma$e, wholost1.5 million followers.Kim Kardashianmay have failed tobreak the internetas promised, but she didshedsome 1.3 million followers.While many celebrities and civilian Instagrammers were furious over their free-falling follower count, others revelled in the massacre.Instagram feels right now hay haha#InstagramPurgepic.twitter.com/TRUIqEL7Bq&mdash; Nika Basa (@nikabasa)December 19, 2014IM SO ANGRY I LOST 1900 INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS WHY TF DID INSTAGRAM WANNA CLEAN OUR ACCOUNTS&mdash; zjm (@Nightmareszarry)December 19, 2014Them 500K ppl really thought they was following me tho.

Recentreportssuggest that there are more bots on the internet than there are people on the planet.Manycompaniespromise users the opportunity to buy a bunch of followers (mostly bot accounts) on social networking sites includingTwitter, Instagram andVineto appear more popular.Instagram’s latest move means this now appears a risky investment. Users who make money from sponsored posts due to their large follower count also stand to lose out.Instagram, owned by Facebook, has previouslyacknowledgedthat spamming is a problem.A spokesman said of the purge: “After receiving feedback from members in the Instagram community, we recently fixed an issue that incorrectly included inactive accounts in follower/following lists.“We believe this will provide a more authentic experience and genuinely reflect people who are actually engaging with each other’s content.”The Instagram account that lost the most followers - an eye-watering 18 million?

Having your smartphone recreate the smell of bacon sizzling on the hob; a wild-flower meadow in summer; or a bubbling pan of mulled wine, might not be at the top of your wishlist for new technology.But that has not deterred Nesta, the “innovation charity that helps bring great ideas to life”, from declaring scent transmission to be one of itstop 10 predictions for 2015.It is already technically possible to send the aroma of freshly baked bread along with a picture of the loaf that has just been plucked from the oven to a friend’s smartphone – as long as it has an attachment called theScentee. But Nesta reckons that next year will be the moment when the technology really takes off.Adrian Cheok, professor of pervasive computing at City University in London, was responsible for the technology behind Scentee. It plugs into a smartphone’s headphone socket and uses alcohol-based aroma cartridges to emit a puff of vapour after being triggered by a signal.The scientist is also working on a way of avoiding the need to use chemicals and cartridges to achieve the same goal. However, it involves an electronic mouthguard that sits in the back of the user’s throat to stimulate the olfactory bulb. Marketing such a device could be a tricky sell.Nesta also mentions the oPhone as further evidence that scent transmission is about to go mainstream. The pipe-shaped device allows scent messages, oroNotes, to be sent from an app called – you guessed it – oSnap.It is about half a century after Smell-O-Vision – and its lesser-known rival AromaRama – failed to convince cinema goers (and owners) that scented movies were the way of the future. Indeed Smell-O-Vision made it into Time magazine’s list of the 100 worst ideas of all time in 2000.Whether Scentee and its rivals are destined to meet the same fate remains to be seen – or rather, smelled.•Fake flavours: why artificial aromas can’t compete with real food smells
Australia’s tax authorities have ruled that bitcoin transactions are subject to the goods and services tax (GST), suggesting that the cryptocurrency is not likely to be classed as “money” in the near future.The ruling mainly applies to Australian businesses running bitcoin exchanges, which let customers trade real money for the digital currency. The decision means that when bitcoin is bought from an exchange, it will have to pay GST on the supply of bitcoin.GST does not usually apply to financial transactions, meaning that a conventional money exchange does not have to charge the tax when Australians buy foreign currency.“A transfer of bitcoin from one entity to another is a ‘supply’ for GST purposes,” the Australian Tax Office said. “The exclusion from the definition of supply for supplies of money does not apply to bitcoin because bitcoin is not ‘money’ for the purposes of the GST Act.”The tax will make running a bitcoin exchange in Australia an expensive proposition, because it is due on the total amount of bitcoin supplied, rather than on the cut the exchange takes above the market value.However, the way an exchange actually operates will make a difference. Bitcoin “trading platforms” are liable for much less GST under the new rules. The difference lies in whether the company buys and sells bitcoin itself, or merely facilitates transactions between third parties in a manner akin to a stock exchange. If it is the latter, then GST is only due on the percentage commission the exchange charges - not on the total amount bought.The ruling also complicates transactions involving spending bitcoin, requiring sellers that accept the currency to treat it as a “taxable supply”, rather than simply money exchanged for goods and services.The office’s rationale for treating bitcoin in this way is that “bitcoin is not a legally recognised universal means of exchange and form of payment by the laws of Australia or the laws of any other country. Therefore, it is not ‘currency (whether of Australia or of any other country)’ under paragraph (a) of the definition of ‘money’.”Not every country has decided to treat bitcoin in this way.Britain abolished VAT on bitcoin trades in March, although it avoided declaring bitcoin a currency. Nonetheless, the UK now treats bitcoin almost identically to conventional currencies, and buying bitcoins is no longer subject to VAT.In December, New York state followed suit, ruling that sales tax was not due on purchases of bitcoin, andagain avoiding explicitly declaring bitcoin a currency.Australia hinted it would be taking the opposite approach in a draft ruling in August, and businesses have been steeling themselves for the final decision. CoinJar, a bitcoin wallet provider and one of Australia’s largest bitcoin firms, relocated to London in the wake of the draft ruling, while some smaller firms have decided to close.•Bitcoin is the worst investment of 2014. But can it recover?
Google has accused Hollywood of attempting to “secretly censor the internet” by reviving the failed Stop Online Piracy Act (Sopa) to enable wholesale site-blocking.The search company alleges that Hollywood studios, through the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), conspired to push through the effects of Sopa through non-legislative measures.“We are deeply concerned about recent reports that the MPAA led a secret, coordinated campaign to revive the failed Sopa legislation through other means, and helped manufacture legal arguments in connection with an investigation by Mississippi state attorney-general Jim Hood,” said Kent Walker, general counsel for Googlein a blog post.Sopa defeatedSopa was a bill put before the US House of Representatives intended to significantly expand the powers of US authorities to combat online trafficking in copyrighted and counterfeited goods.The sweeping act gave companies that claimed their intellectual property was being infringed the power to request court orders to forbid advertising networks such as Google, as well as payment facilities, from conducting business with infringing sites.Complainants could also ban search engines from linking to allegedly infringing sites and obtain court orders requiring internet service providers (ISPs) to block access to those sites.Sopa was defeated in 2012 despite the backing of the MPAA following a public outcry that prompted some 115,000 websites, including Google, to protest against the act. Ten million people signed a petition against Sopa, while 8m made phone calls to Congress and a further 4m sent emails.‘Why is it trying to secretly censor the internet?’Google cited news reports that accused the MPAA and six studios of colluding to “begin a new campaign to figure how it could secretly revive Sopa” and “to achieve wholesale site-blocking by [convincing] state prosecutors to take up the fight against [Google]”.In Britain, copyright holders can seek court orders to force ISPs to block access to sites they deem as infringing copyright. Sites including the notorious Pirate Bay have beenblocked in the UKsince 2012.The movie studios reportedly provided $500,000 a year in legal support, which was increased to $1.175 million for this “campaign”.Google also detailed how the MPAA then convinced the Mississippi attorney-general to support the action, including sending an accusing letter to Google drafted by the MPAA’s law firm Jenner &amp; Block but signed by Hood.Hood then sent a “sweeping 79-page subpoena” for topics he lacked jurisdiction for, according to Google.“While we of course have serious legal concerns about all of this, one disappointing part of this story is what this all means for the MPAA itself, an organisation founded in part ‘to promote and defend the First Amendment and artists’ right to free expression’. Why, then, is it trying to secretly censor the internet?” Walker asked in his blog post.•Google ‘plays hardball’ in Spanish news row
Fans of the block-building phenomenon Minecraft will soon have a new way to explore the game’s chunky universe. Developer Mojang has announced that a new spin-off title, Minecraft: Story Mode, is in development.The narrative-driven adventure series is being created by TellTale Games, a specialist in the genre. The first episode is due out “sometime” in 2015, on Xbox and PlayStation consoles as well as PC, Mac and smartphones.Previously responsible for the critically acclaimed episodic interactive dramas The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, Telltale has told fans that the new game will be a new original story, driven by player choice. It seems the game won’t feature “Steve” the name given to the generic lead character in the original Minecraft, which has now sold over 50 million units on PC, smartphone and consoles.In a blog post, Mojang explained: “We’re not intending on creating an ‘official’ story for Steve, or explaining the world of Minecraft in detail. It will be a cool game.”It seems that the stand-alone game, which won’t require players to own Minecraft, is being developed with the help of the huge and very dedicated Minecraft community - although it hasn’t been made clear how that will work.One thing is clear, however: Telltale won’t be using its experiences with The Walking Dead to make Minecraft’s zombies, and other creatures, more scary. The game will be aimed at the same family audience as the main title.It’s unlikely this is the last Minecraft spin-off we’ll see, as the game brand continues to grow. It is already a huge merchandising hit, with books, clothing and toys all available, as well as a growing range of Lego sets. A Minecraft movie is also in development. In September, Sweden-based Mojang was purchased by Microsoft for $2.5bn; the ability to develop and expand the property was seen at the time as a major motivation for the purchase.Mojang is promising more details early in 2015.
Here we go again. From blockbuster mainstream hits to lesser-known indie gems, these are the 25 games that have kept our reviewers glued to their gigantic HD televisions this year.As ever, it’s a highly subjective list, based on the titles we genuinely played and played, rather than the critical hits we thought we really ought to consider. Apart from that, the rules were simple: every title in the list had to be released for the first time in 2014 (so no remasters, repackages or conversions of early titles), and everything had to be on console or PC, as we’re handling smartphone and tablet favourites in another list.Enough excuses. Here are the first five titles from our selection. Check back to this story every day this week for more additions.25. Titanfall | Microsoft, Xbox OneWhat we said:“Titanfall is a sort of masterpiece, so confident in itself and its identity, yet so reverent in its art direction to the science fiction visions of artists such as Shōji Kawamori, Kunio Okawara, Syd Mead and Chris Foss. You will play for hours, get tired, think you’re done, and switch it off, but then it nags at you and you go back. Sure, it is the pattern of compulsion that has governed the genre since Modern Warfare, but here it is tuned and perfected and ever-so-slightly evolved, and it is wonderful at times.”24. Hohokum | Sony, PS4/VitaWhat we said:“This genuinely feels like an adventure into the unknown, which is an achievement nowadays, although the non-linearity of Hohokum, while its biggest strength, can make the latter part of the game frustrating. It will doubtless perplex many players, but anyone open-minded and looking for something different will have a ball.”23. Fifa 15 / PES 2015 | EA, multiple formats / Konami, multiple formatsWe cheated! Although EA’s title scored higher, as a group we couldn’t separate these two hugely entertaining football sims this year, so we put them both in together.What we said about Fifa:“If this is your first Fifa game on the new gen consoles then you will be blown away by all the little details that together contribute to an overall experience not too dissimilar to watching football on live television.”What we said about PES:“The variety of goals, dribbles, tackles and passing moves means you won’t play the same game twice. It captures the thrills and spills of football brilliantly.”22. OlliOlli | Sony, PS4/Vita/PCWhat we said:“[OlliOlli] brings to life the rhythm and momentum of skateboarding, highlights the importance and impact of a well-timed landing, and engenders the precise focus that will be familiar to skaters across the world [...] It is certainly not a simulation, but for anyone who has travelled with a deck beneath their feet, this is a fascinating interpretation of the experience.”21. The Banner Saga | Stoic, PC/MacWhat we said:“This is a game with a strong sense of place and the ambiance elevates it beyond the immediate competition. The illustrated 2D art is expressive, while Austin Wintory’s score is nothing short of extraordinary – evocative, unusual and rousing. The designer Sid Meier famously said that a game is a series of interesting choices. It’s a maxim fully embraced by The Banner Saga, which stitches those choices into its very fabric to form a tapestry that is wholly your own.”20. The Evil Within | Bethesda, multiple formatsWhat we said:“So, is The Evil Within a proper, back-to-core-values Resident Evil for the 21st century? In a word, yes. It couldn’t even resist the temptation to put “Evil” in its name. It more or less is Resident Evil, with its unathletic, slow-moving protagonist, devastating shotgun, crates to smash, near-monochrome visuals, reel-to-reel tape recorders, squelchy mutant bosses and so on.”19. Civilization: Beyond Earth | Take-Two, PC/MacWhat we said:“The politics and philosophies contained in Beyond Earth are great new additions from a mechanical and structural standpoint, but more than any game in this series, they strip away the polite veneer of diplomacy. Beyond Earth feels positively Darwinian and that’s fitting in a way; on a hostile alien world, only the strong survive and only the brutal thrive.”18. Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare | Activision, multiple formatsWhat we said:“Advanced Warfare is the best that Call of Duty has been for years, a successful negotiation of that troublesome creative and commercial tension. And while the game has nothing substantial to say about the future of warfare, it nevertheless presents a grimly vivid vision of how humanity’s technological ascent will continue to enable the wealthy to better kill and maim others in the pursuit or protection of power.”17. Hearthstone | Activision Blizzard, PC/smartphoneWhat we said:“Video gamers may wonder why they would play a card game when their medium has moved beyond such limitations; tabletop gamers may bemoan the fact that people are getting excited about thewrongcard game. But if you fall awkwardly between those two groups, Hearthstone will keep you hooked for some time.”16. Divinity: Original Sin | Larian Studios, PCSomehow we neglected to review this ostensibly nostalgic role-playing adventure, which harks back to the glory days of the Ultima series with its neat isometric visuals and epic sprawling narrative. However, what really works here is the game’s joyous humour: fantasy video games can be so ludicrously po-faced, but Divinity guides you through its crowded world with a warm smile and a constant stream of knowing jokes. It is like spending 50 hours playing Dungeons and Dragons with a very good, slightly drunken game master. It is the classic RPG for people who have grown tired of classic RPGs.15. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter | The Astronauts, PC/PS4What we said:“This is an ethereal and haunting work that left me constantly on edge. Its beauty lies in its hands-off approach, confronting you with a mystery and leaving you to discover fragments of clues which build together to reveal the story. It’s a mystery game, rather than horror – but when a jump scare did happen, it certainly lived up to that phrase. If you want to be free to make your own way through an intriguing narrative in gorgeous surroundings, this subtle, melancholy game is for you.”14. Dragon Age Inquisition | EA/Bioware, multiple formatsWhat we said:“Inquisition gets under your skull like red lyrium. Objectively, you know your followers singing the theme music to raise morale after a great loss is cheesy, but you still find yourself humming it on the way to work. Then you spend all day at work thinking if you can find 20 elfroots you can improve your potions sufficiently to beat one of the 10 dragons. That truly will be a good day in what is a truly monumental game”13. Wolfenstein: The New Order | Bethesda, multiple formatsWhat we said:“Developer MachineGames has all sorts of fun with the imagined general depravity of triumphant Nazis as well as the technology they would have had at their command by the 1960s. It’s more sophisticated than you might imagine, thanks to a dubious plot device, so you get genetically enhanced, massively armoured super-soldiers, giant dog-like robots and huge multistorey mechs (a Wolfenstein game needs boss-battles).”12. South Park: The Stick of Truth | Ubisoft, PC/PS3/Xbox 360What we said:“If any game ever challenged the old distinction between graphics and gameplay this is it, because simple as its systems are, and even as dull as the fetch-questing can sometimes be, the look and script and voice-acting carry this rocketing over the finish line – as well as through the taste barrier. In some ways this game is to the RPG genre what the animated series is to celebrity voice overs: a comic impersonation. As far as the comedy goes, however, Stick of Truth is fuckin-A dude.”11. Never Alone | E-Line Media, PC/PS4/Xbox OneWhat we said:“The artwork and overall feel is almost cartoonish, yet beautiful and endearing. Despite its minimalist feel (it is basic to the extent that the characters never even speak), it works well at making you feel involved and I found myself with genuine affection for Nuna and Fox and their mission.”10. Dark Souls 2 | Namco, multiple formatsWhat we said:“It’s a huge game, larger than its forebear and it offers perhaps the greatest sense of discovery, victory and, at times, frustration of any video game yet made. There is something mystical in its secrecy, in the obscured rules and storyline that compel you to explore deeper and deeper; there is something primal in the David vs. Goliath stand-offs with hulking beasts and the satisfaction of licking your wounds by a bonfire thereafter.”9. Far Cry 4 | Ubisoft, multiple formatsWhat we said:“Far Cry 4 truly shines in the almost bacchanalian sense of freedom it bestows on the player as they traverse through its environment. In Kyrat you have the ability to go anywhere and do pretty much anything – much as Pagan Min would advocate. Here, the only pact you need keep is that with your conscience. God help you.”8. Super Smash Bros | Nintendo, Wii UWhat we said:“The game’s collection of challenges, mini-games and multiplayer options feels like a toy box; there are even demos of dusty old classics such as Pilotwings and F-Zero, which inspired Smash Bros’ level design. It’s refined, subtle and extremely silly.”7. This War of Mine | 11 Bit Studios, PC/MacWhat we said:“The designers have built something in which it’s possible to survive, but only just – you have to plan carefully and trade well, use the game’s systems to your advantage, stop exploring, limit your ambitions to surviving the next day, scavenging what you know you can find.”6. Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor | Warner Bros, multiple formatsWhat we said:“It turns out that Shadow of Mordor is that rarest of things in video game culture - an unexpected knockout punch. It’s also a glorious return to form for one of the most interesting developers out there – Washington-based Monolith Productions – whose track record is inconsistent but features glorious oddities such as No One Lives Forever, FEAR and Condemned.”5. Forza Horizon 2 | Microsoft, Xbox OneWhat we said:“As a festival of speed, Forza Horizon 2 succeeds in almost every way. With such a strong offering of cars and events, and a gorgeous environment that feels more like a holiday destination than a game location, there’s strength and beauty in Playground Games’ second lap. On top, there’s a stronger multiplayer offering, complete with whole Road Trip events to share with your friends, which take advantage of the game’s spaciousness, the day/night cycle and dynamic weather additions. Add in the ability to start clubs and race socially and you have some real longevity here (even if forthcoming titles like DriveClub and The Crew promise a much more expansive social structure).”4. Alien Isolation | Sega, multiple formatsWhat we said:“This terrifying game is a passionate homage to a horror classic, and a rich, well-designed stealth experience in its own right. Giger’s monstrous alien is, for the first time in a video game, as formidable and menacing as it was in the films. It was brave of Sega to take a chance on a game like this, where guns are a last resort, but their faith in The Creative Assembly’s vision has resulted in an unusually clever and subversive triple-A game.”3. Destiny | Activision, multiple formatsWhat we said:“Make no mistake, Destiny is fun. It is stylish and technically amazing – it will provide weeks of enjoyment if you are committed to its vision. Gathering with friends to take on missions is a treat, and being joined by strangers for impromptu skirmishes leads to some lovely moments of shared drama”2. Bayonetta 2 | Nintendo, Wii UWhat we said:“The sheer polish applied to every part of Bayonetta 2 is something every major studio should aspire to: the exceptional and wide-ranging soundtrack, the huge number of unlocks, theNintendoeaster eggs, the “making of” materials, and the unlockable characters that bring their own style. Not a single thing has been held back. In this second adventure, Bayonetta over-delivers in every regard, and it will be a long time before another fighting game threatens her crown.”1. Mario Kart 8 | Nintendo, Wii UWhat we said:“Regardless of the Wii U’s troubles Nintendo remains one of (if not the) greatest developers on the planet in terms of making games that are a pure joy to play, and Mario Kart 8 is one of its finest. The question with Mario Kart 8 was never really “is this going to be good”, because with Nintendo that much can be taken for granted. The question is whether it’s the best yet. And, among one hell of a field, it takes first place.”
It's Friday.
Uber has agreed to stop operating in Portland for three months just days after the city sued the ride-sharing service for failing to comply with local laws.It had been operating in areas around Portland, but only began offering rides in the Oregon city on Friday last week despite lacking an agreement with authorities over how it should be regulated.A spokeswoman for the company said that Portland had agreed to let Uber resume operations after three months regardless of whether new regulations had been implemented.“Uber has received a tremendously warm welcome from riders and drivers in and around Portland … their support illustrates why it’s time to modernise Portland transportation regulation,” said a spokeswoman on Monday, when the legal action was announced.Uber has attracted controversy for its aggressive approach to local governments and traditional taxi services.It is facing legal challenges in several European countries because authorities say it lacked the appropriate licences.On Monday, the service was banned from operating in New Delhi and several other Indian cities after a female passengeraccused one of its drivers of rape.On Wednesday, an Uber driver in Boston was charged with the kidnapping and rape of a female passenger earlier this month. The driver, Alejandro Done, who has pleaded not guilty, had passed a background check, an Uber spokeswoman said.It also faced more negative publicity this week after introducing surge pricing in central Sydney in the wake of the lockdown prompted by Monday’s cafe siege.Hundreds of taxi drivers blocked roads around Paris on Monday to protest against Uber, preventing access to key roads around Charles de Gaulle airport on Monday before crawling towards the centre of the French capital.The online service was valued atmore than $40bnlast week after its latest funding round ahead of an expected initial public offering next year.US senator Al Franken also said this week that Uber hadfailed to respond adequatelyto questions he submitted last month about its privacy policies.The chair of the Senate subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law wrote to the company last month setting out ten questions after a spate of incidents that he said indicated a “troubling disregard for customers’ privacy”.“They did not answer many of the questions I posed directly to them,” Franken said. “Most importantly, it still remains unclear how Uber defines legitimate business purposes for accessing, retaining, and sharing customer data. I will continue pressing for answers to these questions.”
I have many A4 pads of handwritten notes, which I would like to convert into Microsoft Word documents. To type them all in would take a very long time. I’ve noticed that Google’s ability to read text from photos has vastly improved in recent months. Are you aware of a tool from Google or anyone else that can do a good job of this, please?MichaelThe idea of converting written or printed text into digital text is generally called OCR for optical character recognition, and it has similar problems to speech recognition. That is to say, if the input is close to perfect, the output can also be close to perfect.But in practice, it works best when dealing with restricted inputs and/or limited domains. For example, it’s possible to recognise the English names for numbers and the names of major UK cities, especially if you can get people to write each letter in its own little box. The same software wouldn’t have the domain expertise to cope with a Russian-speaking coroner who liked to include Sanskrit quotations in his handwritten autopsies.Handwriting mattersOCR works best with high-quality printed materials and worst of all with handwriting, so you’re not starting from the best position. In my experience, you can only get handwriting recognition to work well enough by doing it in real time. That enables you to train the software to recognise your input, while the software also trains you to write characters in ways that it can understand. I’ve had some success with this approach, starting more than a decade ago with Microsoft OneNote (which can also record your voice in sync) running on Windows XP Tablet Edition, and more recently with a Livescribe Echo digital pen andMyScriptsoftware. However, all this has more to do with keyboard replacement strategies than with OCR.It’s generally agreed that the best OCR programs areAbbyy FineReader(£99) andNuance’s OmniPage 18(£79.99) and Ultimate (£169.99), though neither is suitable for cursive handwriting recognition. Both companies offer free trial versions so you can test them before you splash out. There’s alsoCharacTell’s SoftWriting($49.95), which the company says is for students taking notes in class and professionals taking notes in meetings. But it also says it is designed “for recognising non-connected handwriting and machine-printed text” (their emphasis) so I wouldn’t bet on it reading your handwritten notes.Like most if not all the programs in this field, SoftWriting has to be trained to recognise your handwriting. When it is processing a document, it will present you with words it doesn’t recognise, so that you can tell it what they are. If you have 250 words on a page and the program miraculously gets 90% of them right, you will still have to correct 25 words.If you want to try a few pages as an experiment, then you can downloadFreeOCRfor Windows, though be careful not to install any crapware that may be included. FreeOCR is based on the widely used Tesseract OCR engine, which was originally developed by Hewlett-Packard in England in the 1980s. HP made it open source in 2005, andGooglenow maintains the source code.You can also use FreeOCR online by uploading PDF files tofree-ocr.com. Google Docs and various other services also use the same Tesseract OCR engine.Wikipedia warnsthat “Tesseract’s output will be very poor quality if the input images are not preprocessed to suit it: Images (especially screenshots) must be scaled up such that the text x-height is at least 20 pixels, any rotation or skew must be corrected or no text will be recognized, low-frequency changes in brightness must be high-pass filtered, or Tesseract’s binarization stage will destroy much of the page, and dark borders must be manually removed, or they will be misinterpreted as characters.”PDFs and scannersYour handwritten notes would be more useful in Microsoft Word format because you could do lots of things with them. For example, you could change the typeface, size and spacing, correct and amend your notes, add illustrations, and so on. But unless you have extremely neat, clear and very consistent handwriting, that probably won’t be possible. Instead, think about converting them to high-quality, scanned PDF files that you can store on a hard drive or in the cloud.You can feed these PDF files to OCR software and hope that it will recognize enough words to make your notes searchable. If not, you will probably have to tag them manually. Either way, if someone does come up with an OCR program that can read your handwriting – not impossible, though I’ve already waited 30 years for one – you will be ready with sharp PDF files, rather than curling originals where the paper has aged and the ink has faded.Of course, if you are going to scan your notes then you must already have a scanner, or be prepared to buy one. A cheapEpsonorCanonflat-bed scanner should give good results, though it is time-consuming to scan a lot of pages. If you intend to do a lot of scanning, consider a sheet-fed model like theBrother ADS-2100(from £222). You can also get scanners that include OCR, such asFujitsu ScanSnap iX500 Duplex(from £352), which scans both sides of the paper at once. (The scanner’s OCR software usually runs on your PC.)Scanning servicesIf you have to buy a decent scanner and perhaps good quality OCR software for a one-off project, add up the cost and divide it by the number of pages of notes to find the cost per page. It’s a boring job, so perhaps you should add the cost of your time. The result might prompt you to abandon the whole idea, or start looking for a company to do it for you.Most of the companies that provide scanning services cater for businesses that need to clear away large volumes of paper records. However, some cater for low-volume and home users. One example is Oxford-basedScanning Geeks, which charges 25p per page for documents up to A3 in size. (One page means one side of a page.) They can do OCR (“Textual Data Capture”) as well. Ideally, find a good local company where you can drop off your notes securely and collect them afterwards.It’s an expensive route if you have lots of paper: it could cost £3,000 to scan the contents of a four-drawer filing cabinet. But if you only have 100 to 500 pages of notes to scan, it could be the best option.
Apple has been ordered to hand over documents in an investigation into whether the company used unfair tactics to boost iPhone sales in Canada.The country’s competition bureau said agreements that Apple struck with mobile networks may have encouraged the operators not to reduce the prices of rival phones or to increase them.Huge consumer demand for the iPhone has given Apple considerable bargaining power when negotiating contracts with mobile operators and some believe the company has abused its position.The US company has 90 days to hand over the documents, including deals it had reached with Canadian mobile networks.A spokesperson for Apple declined to comment on whether it might appeal against the ruling.The Competition Bureau lawyer Derek Leschinsky said it was possible Apple could challenge of the right of Canadian courts to force its Canadian subsidiary to turn over records held by the US parent company.European questionnaireHowever, the country’s competition law allows Canadian courts the power to compel the production of documents held outside the country.Last year, the European commission sent a questionnaire to several mobile network operators in an effort to determine its sales tactics with iPhones.“The commission has information indicating that Apple and mobile network operators have concluded distribution agreements which may potentially lead to the foreclosure of other smartphone manufacturers from the markets,” the questionnaire stated.The move followed complaints made by networks to the commission about the contracts that had been struck with Apple. However, no anti-trust investigation was opened.This week a jury in Californiafound in favour of Applein a lawsuit concerning iPods and iTunes.The eight jurors in Oakland rejected a claim by iPod buyers and resellers that Apple’s iTunes software amounted to anticompetitive behaviour because it prevented the use of competing music players by consumers.Applehad argued that iTunes provided necessary security protection and was part of a larger package of features that made its iPods and iTunes music store popular with music fans.•Anti-trust lawsuit shot down in three hours by jury
Apple has inadvertently confirmed that its mobile wallet and online payment system, Apple Pay, is coming to Europe by posting a job advertisement on its website.The advert, which has now been taken down, said that the company was seeking a London-based intern to “drive out the roll-out” of Apple Pay across Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa.“Apple Pay is a new and exciting area in Apple that is set to expand across Europe, Middle East, India and Africa,” read theadvert. “Apple Pay will change the way consumers pay with breakthrough contactless payment technology and unique security features built right into their iPhone 6 or Apple Watch to pay in an easy, secure, and private way.”Apple Pay comprises two related services that both require close links between Apple and existing banks. The first is an in-app payment tool, which developers can implement to allow customers to make purchases without entering credit card details. In apps such as Uber, users will instead be able to pay by simply tapping the touch ID sensor of an iPhone 6, iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3.Contactless technologyThe second service allows users to buy items in stores using their NFC-enabled iPhone 6, or their Apple Watch - which is yet to go on sale.In the US, Apple Pay has taken considerable preparation because of the need to ensure retailers have compatible hardware. However, existing technology in many European shops should make the task easier on this side of the Atlantic.The technology works with the same terminals as contactless payments, so retailers that already accept those cards should be able to use Apple Pay with the flick of a switch.On top of the promise of increased ease of use, Apple is touting the security benefits of its service. Unlike paying with a card online, or a swipe-card in stores (still common in the US) that reveals all the information on the card to the merchant, Apple Pay sends a one-use token.That means in the case of a hack such as the widespread data theft from US retailers Target and Home Depot earlier this year, the stolen information cannot be used to authorise further transactions.Further, the company promises that users are doubly secured if they lose their device. Not only does the system need a fingerprint to initiate a transaction, it can also be remotely disabled.Apple Pay launches in US
Smartphones from a major Chinese manufacturer have a security flaw that was deliberately introduced and allows hackers full control of the device.The “CoolReaper” backdoor was found in the software that powers at least 24 models made by Coolpad, which is now the world’s sixth-biggest smartphone producer according to Canalys.The flaw allows hackers or Coolpad itself to download and install any software onto the phones without the user’s permission.“The operator can simply uninstall or disable all security applications in user devices, install additional malware, steal information and inject content into the users device in multiple ways,” according to areport on the malware by security firmPalo Alto Networks (Pan).‘It’s possible that over 10m users have been affected’The backdoor may not have been installed by Coolpad, but by hackers who had broken into the company’s systems. However, Pan found that the phone’s Android operating systems had been modified to hide the malware from the user and security programs.Pan also found that the server remotely controlling the malware on the phones was owned by Coolpad.In China, Coolpad outsells Apple and Samsung and is beaten only by Xioami and Lenovo with 11.5% of the smartphone market, according to IDC data.Coolpad sold 37.2m smartphones in 2013 and is targeting 60m phones worldwide in 2014.Pan said: “The known impact of CoolReaper thus far is limited to China and Taiwan, but Coolpad’s position in the market and global expansion plans mean this backdoor presents a threat to Android users all over the world.“We do not know how many Coolpad devices contain the CoolReaper backdoor. Considering that CoolReaper appears to have been developed and embedded into 24 phone models in the last 12 months, and the Coolpad sales targets published by IDC, it’s possible that over 10m users have been affected.”Pan also found vulnerabilities in the backdoor that would let hackers take control of the flaw, even if Coolpad was not using it for malicious reasons.The biggest problem is that users are powerless to do anything about the flaw, short of modifying the operating system. They may also be unaware that their data such as personal data, credit card information and logins and passwords was being stolen.•Chinese smartphone sold on Amazon and eBay contains built-in malware
It’s being tipped as the lesbian equivalent ofGrindr, but “classier”, a dating app “for lesbians, by lesbians”: introducing, the none-too-subtly named,Scissr.The free app, which will be available oniOSandAndroid, will fill a gap in the women-seeking-women app sector.The brainchild of the Chicago-based climbing instructor Allison Ullrich, Scissr promises to offer a “mind-blowing” experience.After experiencing little luck with the more traditional dating techniques of bar hopping and mingling with mutual friends, Ullrich hit on the idea of Scissr.“I think what spawned the idea was life – reality – and conversations I’ve had with my friends regarding relationships and women,” shetoldDNAinfo.Ullrich was disappointed with heterosexual-focused apps and websites such asOkCupid,MatchandTinder.Tinder, for instance, will often throw up men as options for women who have set their preferences for other women.The app allows users to upload three pictures and a short bio.Photograph: ScissrWith the the help of her friend, Adnan Beck and developersOra Interactive, Scissr was born.Users must be over 18, and are allowed to upload three photographs and write a bio of 300 words.The app will feature private messages, and the option to “crush” on a user or add them to a “wish list”. There will also be preferences, including: “hookup”; “love and relationship”; “networking”; and “friendship”.Sexuality options to choose from are: lesbian, bisexual and “curious”.As with many other dating and messaging apps, Scissr will work with GPS data to find potential romance options in a location close to the user, but unlike other apps, won’t geofence to restrict potential matches to a certain proximity.Scissr is the latest dating app towards the gay market.Photograph: ScissrScissr isn’t the first app geared towards gay women:Daatch,BrendaandWing Ma’amare already on the market and have proven popular.And websites such asPink Cupid,Pink LobsterandDivaDatealso exist. But Ullrich hopes Scissr will offer more.“We want to connect and promote those in the LGBT community through our independent or shared cultural interests,” she said.There’s no release date yet for Scissr, but the website promises that the app will be (ahem) “coming soon”.•Tinder: the ‘painfully honest’ dating app with wider social ambitions
Evan Spiegel is not a happy man. Snapchat’s chief executive is furious, in fact, after some previously-unreported acquisitions and future business plans were splashed all over the tech blogosphere this week, after being leaked as part of the Sony Pictures hack.In an internal memo, Spiegel gave his response to the stories, and latertweeted a screenshot of the memo outfor wider airing:“I’ve been feeling a lot of things since our business plans were made public last night. Definitely angry. Definitely devastated. I felt like I was going to cry all morning, so I went on a walk and thought through a couple of things. I even ran into one of my high school design teachers. She gave me a huge hug. I really needed it.”Much of the memo was about the importance of secrecy for a startup like Snapchat, with Spiegel going on to say he felt that the company had been “violated and exposed” by the reports based on the Sony leaks.The memo was also an instructive insight into how he views the media: “It’s not fair that the people who try to build us up and break us down get a glimpse of who we really are,” wrote Spiegel.I shared this with our team today and I wanted to share it with our partners and friends bc I think it&#39;s important.pic.twitter.com/eN5HpAhp42&mdash; Evan Spiegel (@evanspiegel)December 17, 2014So, is it? There’s a view that writing articles based on leaked Sony emails is not that different from writing articles based on hacked voicemails –see Brad Pitt’s arguments on that.There’s another view that once documents are in the public domain – in this case, the hackers have placed them there – they are fair game for reporting. TechCrunch journalist Josh Constine argued in favour of this:RE ethics of pubbing info from Sony leak: I don&#39;t feel cheery about it, but we treat it like any info passed to us, often against the rules&mdash; Josh Constine (@JoshConstine)December 17, 2014It’s about ethics in technology journalism! So what do you think: should private emails released as part of a hack attack be fair game for technology reporters – or, indeed, reporters in any industry?

Some more links to chew on:No offline viewing for NetflixSorry, folks: you won’t be watching House of Cards without a decent Wi-Fi connection any time soon. Netflix’s Cliff Edwards told TechRadar that offline downloads are a “short term fix for a bigger problem” of constant, reliable broadband connectivity. I’d be interested to know whether licensing restrictions are a factor here too.Reddit bans users for sharing Sony leaksReddit has banned a number of accounts, and closed one subreddit, for sharing information released as part of the Sony Pictures leaks. “So one has to wonder: where was that rule when Reddit users were posting nude photographs stolen from celebrities’ smartphones without repercussions?” asks PandoDaily.BuzzFeed boss talks technologyThe Verge has a really interesting interview with BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti about how his company has evolved: from blending content and technology, to the role played by standalone mobile apps, to whether the company is increasingly competing with Facebook, not just using it to get stories out.Apple makes VAT changes for apps in EuropeFrom January, VAT will be charged on iOS apps according to rates in each individual European country, rather than the same flate rate across the continent. Which, at least, means that next time a British chancellor changes the VAT rate, we get to describe it as a “Candy Crush tax”. Possibly.What else?

Web video startupVesselhas revealed its plans to take on YouTube in 2015, including striking “early access” exclusivity deals with some of the latter company’s popular channels.Vessel will launch early in 2015 as a two-tier service: a free ad-supported version, and a $2.99-a-month subscription tier promising fewer ads and “early access to the web’s best short-form videos”.In the latter case, videos will be available to Vessel subscribers for at least 72 hours before moving to its free tier and rivals like YouTube. Creators will be able to extend the exclusivity period for as long as they like, though.Vessel was founded by two former executives from online video service Hulu: chief executive Jason Kilar and chief technology officer Richard Tom.The San Francisco-based company is backed by venture capital firms Benchmark Capital and Greylock Partners, as well as Amazon boss Jeff Bezos’ investment firm Bezos Expeditions. In June, tech news site Recode reported thatVessel had raised $75min its initial funding round.“Around the time that my co-founder, Rich, and I started Vessel, we observed that the audiences so coveted by traditional TV were gravitating toward a new generation of digital storytellers,”wrote Kilar in a blog post.“Many of these voices have become brands in their own right, building passionate audiences that rival the size of the most popular shows on network and cable TV.”Vessel has already signed up three YouTube multi-channel networks (MCNs) – Machinima, Tastemade and DanceOn. Individual YouTubers already on board include Rhett &amp; Link, Shane Dawson, Marcus Butler, Caspar Lee and Ingrid Nilsen.(Among the34 people followed by Vessel’s Twitter accountare even more popular YouTubers Ray William Johnson, Connor Franta, O2L, Grace Helbig, Zoella, and Hank and John Green, but that’s not yet proof of deals with those creators.)Vessel is definitely working with TV firm A+E Networks, actor and producer Alec Baldwin, and music label Warner Music Group though, with the latter’s artists able to debut new videos on Vessel first before launching them elsewhere on YouTube, Vevo and other music video sites.Vevo is a partner for Vessel’s ad-supported tier though, where Warner’s videos will be joined by content from rival major labels Sony and Universal.Rhett &amp; Link have 2.9m YouTube subscribers but are a Vessel launch partner.The free tier will also include comedy clips, news reports, sports highlights and other videos from partners including Funny or Die, Time, BuzzFeed, TED, Major League Soccer and the New York Times.Today’s “creator preview” aims to attract more partners, particularly those unhappy with what Kilar described as the “low, single-digit dollars for every thousand views” that their videos often generate on YouTube.“At this level of monetization (or even 5x this level of monetization), it is extremely challenging – if not impossible – for most creators and content owners to realize their creative and professional ambitions if this is the sole manner in which they release their content,” he wrote.“During the early access period on Vessel, we estimate that creators will earn approximately $50 for every thousand views (approximately 20x the levels earned from free, ad-supported distribution).”Vessel says it will divide up 60% of its subscription revenues between channels on its early-access tier, based on their share of viewing time: “If a creator’s videos accounted for 5% of all the minutes consumers spent watching subscription content on Vessel, that creator would get 5% of the subscription dollars set aside for creators,” as the company’s launch FAQ put it.Channels will also receive 70% of all the revenues from advertisements running around their videos on Vessel’s free tier, and will also be able to earn money from referral fees if their fans sign up to a subscription.Taking on YouTube is a huge challenge. Google’s video servicehas more than one billion monthly viewerswatching more than six billion hours of video every month, and claims that “thousands” of its channels are making six-figure annual revenues.That has not quashed a debate among MCNs and individual creators about whether they should be making more money on YouTube, or their interest in opportunities on other sites though.Besides Vessel,Yahoo is reportedly keen to poach popular YouTubersfor its own shortform video service, possiblyunder the umbrella of its Tumblr blogging site.Facebook, where videos uploaded directly to the social network arenow watched more than one billion times a day, is also lurking, with the Wall Street Journal claiming in September thatit had plans to “muscle in” on YouTubeby persuading MCNs and creators to test uploading their videos to Facebook.Meanwhile, some MCNs like Disney-owned Maker Studios havelaunched their own sites and apps, where they will be able to keep 100% of any advertising revenues rather than the standard 55% share offered by YouTube.Vessel will blend online video stars with familiar media brands.Even so, YouTube remains the dominant company in the online video world, with a recently-appointed chief executive – veteran Googler Susan Wojcicki – who is overseeing its efforts to fend off the rivals trying to poach its biggest stars.YouTube has thrown its marketing weight behind key channels and stars with high-profile advertising campaigns across TV, print and billboards forBethany Mota, Michelle Phan and Epic Rap Battles of History in the US, andZoella, Vice News and Slow Mo Guys in the UK.In September, as rumours mounted of rivals waving their chequebooks at its biggest stars, YouTube announced that it was alsoplanning to back key partners with production budgets.“We’ve decided to fund new content from some of our top creators, helping them not only fulfill their creative ambitions but also deliver new material to their millions of fans on YouTube,” explained the company at the time.In December, the Wall Street Journal claimedYouTube was offering some of those stars “bonus” paymentsin return for multi-year deals to post their videos on YouTube first, as a direct response to Vessel’s launch plans.One source for that report described YouTube as being “in a fire drill” mode in response to the likely competition for creators. With Vessel’s creator preview announcement today, that drill will shift to a full-scale alert.•YouTube multichannel networks stake claim to the future of TV
BlackBerry is returning to its roots with a new smartphone called the Classic, which imitates its previous models, even to features that hark back to 2012.The Classic, an unabashed throwback, looks like everything smartphone manufacturers – including BlackBerry itself – have spent years running from. It features a traditional Qwerty keyboard for tap-happy business-class emailers. The screen, at three and a half inches, is small. The processor is a 2012 model and the memory is two gigabytes of RAM – compared to the estimated 1 gigabyte the iPhone can command.The Classic is modeled on the BlackBerry Bold, a favorite model among fans. BlackBerryhinted in Marchthat it would bring back a classic version to appeal to its core audience, who dislike typing on slippery touchscreens. The Classic will have access to Android apps, but given its modest memory, it’s unlikely users will make much use of them.BlackBerry is courting its primary customer, the business user. The model is sure to appeal to businesspeople, who rely on the BlackBerry for easy typing and a focus purely on email. The company is also emphasizing battery life and security as a way to set its phone apart from competitors.The company is trying to stay relevant on the hardware side of the business as it attempts to pivot toward becoming an enterprise security and consumer software company. Whether the Classic will sell enough to keep it in the hardware business is unclear.There is a lot of pressure on relatively the new CEO, John Chen, to turn around the company’s fortunes after a trip to the brink last year, whenBlackBerry couldn’t find a merger partner.Last month, analysts at Nomura Securities called BlackBerry “tantalizing yet elusive” as a company because it was hard to predict its future performance.“We find ourselves in a difficult spot. We like the product offering and believe that there is a compelling turn-around story ahead of BlackBerry. We need to spend a bit more time to frame the potential opportunity, but note that the range of potential outcomes appears broad and hard to narrow down,” the analysts wrote.The chief problem: BlackBerry was fading into the background. “In effect, BlackBerry now offers the same experience as its key rivals on Android and iOS, while offering the extra security capabilities built into the BlackBerry platform.”
BlackBerry dug out its Bold and give it a new lick of paint in the form of the new BlackBerry Classic.Afterlacklustre receptionof its recent BlackBerry 10 devices, which was somewhat boosted by thesquare Passportthat saw the physical keyboard stretched as wide as a small tablet, the Canadian company has decided to stick with what it knows its customers used to like.“We listened closely to our customers’ feedback to ensure we are delivering the technologies to power them through their day – and that feedback led directly to the development of BlackBerry Classic,” said John Chen, chief executive of BlackBerry. “BlackBerry Classic is the powerful communications tool that many BlackBerry Bold and Curve users have been waiting for. It’s the secure device that feels familiar in their hands, with the added performance and agility they need to be competitive in today’s busy world.”‘No-nonsense smartphone’BlackBerry describes the Classic as a “no-nonsense smartphone built to meet the needs of productive people who appreciate the speed and accuracy that can be found with a physical keyboard”.As such it is the spitting image of the BlackBerry Bold from 2011, which is still being used by businesses that haven’t yet dropped BlackBerrys as their prescribed work phone.“By bringing back the trusted functionalities, incorporating our latest operating system and building a speedier browser, our users can feel confident they are using the best communications tool out there,” said Chen.Unlike the Passport, the Classic has the the physical shortcut keys and optical navigation button that made the Bold popular, as well as the a 3.5in touchscreen. It promises 22 hours of battery life and a modern processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Like a lot of Android smartphones it also has a microSD card slot for adding more storage.Highlights include a web browser that is three times faster than the Bold, and access to Amazon’s app store for a limited number of Android applications.Security and privacy by defaultBlackBerry is pushing privacy and encryption by default with the Classic, as well as “built-in protection against viruses, tampering and data leaks.”Whether the Classic is enough to turn around BlackBerry’s continued slide in device marketshare remains to be seen. The Passport managed to buoy up BlackBerry’s share price along with its aggressive cost cutting.BlackBerry’s refocus on business users, in effect jettisoning its consumer offerings, has been seen as a positive move by some industry watchers, which the Classic is likely to feed directly into. BlackBerry’s biggest challenge, it seems, is theperceived instability of its future, which it has to overcome to satisfy concerns and attracted back big business.For BlackBerry die-hards, the Classic is likely to be the answer to their prayers – a tried and tested design with updated software – but it is unlikely to tempt anyone away from Apple’s iPhone or the many good options among the Android devices.•BlackBerry looks to long turnaround despite sliding sales
In the wake of the massive hack that has seen more than 250GB of private files shared online, Sony Pictures is successfully cracking down on discussion of its stolen data on sites such as Reddit.The social news site has deleted posts, blocked individual user accounts, and banned a subreddit devoted to sharing the files, after takedown notices from the film company.At the core of the deletions, prompted by a takedown notice from Sony citing the American Digital Millennium Copyright Act, was the SonyGOP subreddit. Before the takedown, it served as a hub of discussion around the files, but also as a depository for download links to the content – which remains, strictly speaking, Sony’s copyrighted material.SonyGOP is now returning a “subreddit banned” notice, and the moderator of the page (a throwaway account also named SonyGOP) has also had their account deleted.Reddit told Business Insider’s James Cook that“discussions and news stories” about the hack were still allowed on the site.The removal of SonyGOP has echoes of Reddit’s previous removal of the subreddit TheFappening, where Redditors congregated to share and discuss photos stolen from celebrities’ iCloud accounts. The subreddit was also bombarded with DMCA takedown notices, but the lack of a single authority with ownership of all the material meant that Reddit didn’t remove the whole subforum, instead policing it on a piecemeal basis.Eventually, however, it decreed that the subreddit as a whole fell foul of its rules on sharing personal data, and removed it.The takedowns on Reddit are the most successful example of Sony’s legal campaign to suppress the dissemination of the stolen material. On Monday, the film company sent a legal letter to a number of news sites around the world, including the New York Times and Re/Code, demanding that they “destroy the stolen information”.“If you do not comply with this request, and the stolen information is used or disseminated by you in any manner, Sony Pictures Entertainment will have no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination,” the letter continued.SnapchatBut despite the letters, the stories from the stolen data keep on coming. Thanks to the involvement of one Sony executive in the board of photo messaging app Snapchat, the hack has led to confirmation that the firm really did pass up a multibillion-dollar acquisition offer from Facebook.Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, a Snapchat board member, was asked over email by the New Yorker staffer Malcolm Gladwell whether the company really had turned down a $3bn offer. “If you knew the real number you would book us all a suite at Bellvue,”was Lynton’s reply.The firm’s rejection of the buyout offer was seen by many in 2013 as evidence of Snapchat’s hubris. But others compared it to Instagram, a company which accepted just $1bn to be acquired by Facebook and is now the same size as Twitter, which has a market cap of $23bn.
Not yet been terrified by the Year 2038 problem? Somehow you must have missedreportsclaiming it poses a threat, as exposed byGangnam style(yes, you read that correctly), to our computerised future.In fact, it is claimed, Y2038 is so bad it could be worse than Y2k.Well that’s absolutely true. Just like Y2K, if left unchecked, Y2038 could cause major issues for any computer systems. But just like Y2k, any prediction of planes falling out of the sky and the banking system melting down are likely to bea long long way from coming true.So should you worry? No. But here’s what you need to know …What is Y2038?The year 2038 problem is caused by 32-bit processors and the limitations of the 32-bit systems they power. The processor is the central component that drives all computers and computing devices. It crunches the numbers and performs calculations that allow programs to run.Essentially, when the year 2038 strikes 03:14:07 UTC on 19 March, computers still using 32-bit systems to store and process the date and time won’t be able to cope with the date and time change. Like the Y2K bug, the computers won’t be able to tell the difference between the year 2038 and 1970 – the year after which all current computer systems measure time.What does 32-bit mean?Processors come in many difference sizes and capabilities designed for different applications, but most of them operate and crunch numbers in a similar manner.The first desktop computer processors were 16-bit and ran 16-bit software, which meant they could store and access values up to 216or 65,536 distinct values within 64KB of memory. Other notable 16-bit systems include the 1990’s gaming consoles theSuper NintendoandSega MegaDrive, which took over from 1980’s 8-bit systems.Later, 32-bit processors were developed that ran 32-bit software and increased the number of values a system could handle 232different values or 4,294,967,295 different numbers within 4GB of memory. The systems stored dates and times in 32-bit chucks. In reality that large number of different values is halved for time keeping and other data storage applications as they range from -2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647 leaving only 2,147,483,647 positive values from zero.Modern processors that power almost every computer bought today, and are starting to make their way into smartphones and tablets too, are based on a 64-bit system and 64-bit software. They also have a maximum number of different values they can address but at 264or 18 quintillion values within 16Exabytesof memory, the ceiling is considerably higher at a date that is over twenty times greater than the estimated age of the universe or 292bn years from now.What’s the problem with 32-bit systems?The basic problem is about a computer’s capacity to count the time in seconds past a certain date. As computers measure time in seconds from 1 January 1970, 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038 is equal to 2,147,483,647 seconds after 1 January 1970. As 32-bit date and time systems can only count up to 2,147,483,647 separate positive values the system cannot continue counting the seconds past that time.To continue to count the seconds the values will start to be stored in negative counting up from -2,147,483,647 to zero. But most systems will not be able to cope with this change and will likely fail.A similar issue happened with YouTube, where the number of views of Psy’s Gangnam Style passed 2bn and broke the 2,147,483,647 limit of the 32-bit counter Google supposedly used.What will happen?How computer systems will fail is unknown. Some may continue to work fine just with the date wrong. Others that rely on precise date and time may simply stop working.The biggest issue, like the Y2K bug, is that computer systems that control crucial infrastructure stop working all at the same time. Planes crashing out of the sky was the common scaremongering example from the Y2K.Is it really going to happen?The simple answer is no, not if the computer systems are upgraded in time. The problem is likely to rear its head before the year 2038 for any system that counts years in to the future.A calendar system that counts and stores appointments for 20 years into the future will start seeing issues in 2018, for instance.However, almost all modern processors in desktop computers are now made and sold as 64-bit systems running 64-bit software. Microsoft’s Windows has offered a 64-bit version since Windows XP Professional 64-bit released in 2005.Apple’s OS X desktop software has been exclusively 64-bit since the release of Mac OS X 10.7 “Lion” in 2011.Many Unix systems that are used to power web servers and other backend hardware may still use 32-bit date systems, but most should be replaceable over time.The computers that have the potential to cause the biggest issues are those embedded systems that cannot be upgraded. They are used in many transportation systems and other long-living devices, equipment such as stability control systems in cars or other isolated computer-based systems.Not all embedded systems rely on precise dates, however, and so will be unaffected often just tracking the difference between times, not absolute dates.Those embedded systems that are effected are likely to have to be completely replaced as the software can’t simply be upgraded.What’s going to be done?The reality of Y2038 being a problem is that many 32-bit systems will naturally wear out or be replaced in the next 23 years. Those systems that might not will need changing ahead of time.Infrastructure is likely to be the biggest headache to fix – devices in power stations for instance – but planning the change far enough in advance should remove most big problems.•Y2K bug triggers army conscription notices sent to 14,000 dead men•Leap second hits Qantas air bookings, while Reddit and Mozilla stutter•Millennium bug fails to bite
2014 has been a rough year for bitcoin. Almost as soon as it began, the currency was shaken by news of the collapse of MtGox, once the sole bitcoin exchange.The same month, Charlie Shrem, a Bitcoin Foundation board member, was arrested for alleged money laundering. And over the rest of spring, the currency was rocked by repeated thefts and hacking scandals.But the worst was to come: obscurity. A hefty hack may hurt bitcoin temporarily, but far worse for the currency is no one talking about it at all. And over the second half of 2014, that’s what happened. As conversation and excitement about bitcoin dried up, so too did the currency’s value, dropping from more than $900 a coin at its peak in January to just $334 today.To put that another way,as Matt Phillips of business site Quartz did: “Bitcoin is the worst investment of 2014”. If you held one bitcoin at the beginning of 2014, you would have lost 52% of the value of your investment. That’s worse than buying into the Greek stock exchange (28%) or the Argentine peso (24%). Depending on where the Russian rouble is when you read this, it may even prove to be a worse investment than that free-falling currency, although at press time the real currency marginally outperforms the fake one, the Rouble having lost 51% of its value.But within the bitcoin community, there’s still hope that the currency can recover. Speaking to the Guardian in November, Brian Armstrong, CEO of full-service bitcoin processor Coinbase, said that he sees signs that the currency is healthy and maturing. “A lot of the news that has come out [in 2014] has been firsts … there’s now 10 merchants in the US with over a billion dollars in revenue” taking bitcoin payments. “At the beginning of this year, there were zero.”That was before the latest news of Coinbase expansion, with the firm partnering with publisher Time Inc. toaccept bitcoin paymentsfor magazine subscriptions.“I can throw out other numbers which are interesting too,” Armstrong continues. “Our consumer wallet growth is 10x in the last year, and despite the price going up or down our core metrics around user sign-ups, deposits of bitcoin, and so on, continue to grow at a good rate. Maybe more interesting is merchant activity … that graph looks great.”Still, if things look bad for bitcoin, spare a thought for Dogecoin. In January of this year, the meme-based cryptocurrency was nearly unheard of, before its community scored its first major publicity hit by raising $30,000 to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the winter olympics. By March, the community had successfully sponsored a Nascar car,the #98 Moonrocket. And then over the summer, it all came crashing down, as Moolah, the biggest player in the Dogecoin market,collapsed amid accusations of hacking and scams.Wow. Such cryptocurrency. Many ignoble death.
In November, astudy released by the Canadian Centre for International Governanceclaimed that while 60% of internet users had heard of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, only 39% of those people had taken additional steps to protect their online privacy as a result.The latter seemed like a disheartening statistic: how could people read the Snowden revelations – including numerous spin-off articles on how to better protect your privacy online – and not take action? But wait a minute: security expert Bruce Schneier thinks that was the wrong conclusion to draw.“I disagree with the “Edward Snowden Revelations Not Having Much Impact on Internet Users” headline. He’s having an enormous impact,”wrote Schneier in a blog post.“I ran the actual numbers country by country, combining data on Internet penetration with data from this survey. Multiplying everything out, I calculate that706 million peoplehave changed their behavior on the Internet because of what the NSA and GCHQ are doing...Note that the countries in this survey only cover 4.7 billion out of a total 7 billion world population. Taking the conservative estimates that 20% of the remaining population uses the Internet, 40% of them have heard of Snowden, and 25% of those have done something about it, that’s an additional 46 million people around the world.”Perhaps that 39% stat isn’t as bleak after all, but are there ways to persuade the remaining 61% – and remember, this is just internet users who’ve heard of Edward Snowden – to take measures too? The comments section is open for your thoughts.What else? Here are some more stories to think about today:Uber responds to senator’s privacy questionsRecent media coverage of taxi-app firm Uber’s privacy policies led US senator Al Franken to demand some answers. Now the company has provided them, in a letter released by his office. “Uber has always had a strong culture of protecting rider information...”Teenage revenge porn is on the risePando Daily reports on a new study by anti-bullying group Ditch the Label. “Some 24 percent of British teenagers have had nude images published online without their consent... 26 percent reported suicidal thoughts, 12 percent tried to kill themselves, and 5 percent left school or college.”We should worry more about employee use of our dataOne issue highlighted by Uber’s recent controversies was the fact that our data can be misused without leaving a company, if employees access it when they shouldn’t be, or with inappropriate intentions.

Apple, Google and even Microsoft do not usually face a battle in getting consumers to use their products, but 2015 could bring just such a challenge.Each of the technology giants will have a smartwatch available by next year, even though there is less than overwhelming demand from the public for such a device.Research by Ipsos Mori has found that awareness of smartwatches has doubled to 44% since the fourth quarter of 2012. Of those who know what a Motorola Moto 360 and a Pebble actually are, almost half say they have no need for such a device.Andrew Maguire, associate director at Ipsos Mori who wrote the company’s Tech Tracker, said: “The increases in awareness, no doubt driven by this year’s high-profile product launches, haven’t yet converted into purchases, with only 1% of UK adults claiming to own or use one.”‘Raised the profile of smartwatches’The launch of Google’s Android Wear watches from Sony, Samsung, LG and Motorola, as well as the second generation Pebble smartwatch, have all contributed to rising levels of awareness of the technology.The announcement of Apple’s smartwatch in September, despite not being released until spring 2015, also helped to boost the profile of “wearables” .“The Apple Watch has already raised the profile of smartwatches with the general public and will continue do so through this coming year,” said Ben Wood, chief of research from CCS Insight, which was not connected with the survey.‘Unsure of the benefits’Despite good awareness, with four in 10 of the 987 people aged 15 and over surveyed knowing what a smartwatch is – a similar awareness to contactless payments via smartphones, 3D printers and cloud computing – only 2% who were aware of them actually owned one.“Consumers are unsure of the benefits and relevance of the product, with nearly half (47%) saying that they didn’t see a need for them to have one, and 18% citing them as ‘gimmicks’,” said Maguire. “Just under a quarter - 24% - also mentioned the expense as a reason why they haven’t yet purchased one.”The biggest challenge facing smartwatches is the lack of a killer app - a function to convince buyers that they need to buy a smartphone accessory costing in excess of £100.“The Apple Watch will likely have a broader appeal past early adopters, and even if all it did was tell the time, Apple is likely to sell millions of the first generation device,” said Wood.“Apple is also crowd-sourcing best-in-class mobile app development, leveraging the large developer community it has built up with the App Store and using them to find and develop the killer functions. That will have a knock-on effect for the others, including Google’s Android Wear, which will benefit from the increased focus on app development,” he added.Whether the Apple Watch and 2015’s crop of smartwatches are able to overcome the plight faced by wearable technology this year, when a third of US usersabandoned their deviceswithin six months of buying them, is another matter.•Click tock: which is the best smartwatch this Christmas?•Sony Smartwatch 3 review: great design, good screen and decent battery•Smartwatch review: LG’s G Watch R is chunky, masculine, and fast•Motorola Moto 360 review: beautiful smartwatch spoiled by poor battery life•Google smartwatches review: LG G Watch, Samsung Gear Live and Android Wear

A class-action antitrust suit against Apple, in the works for almost 10 years and contending the tech giant abused iPod updates to control the market, ended in just three hours after a jury decided in the company’s favor.Eight members of a federal jury in California unanimously decided that Apple’s frequent software updates for iPods legitimately improved the devices, and were not used to block competitors and reduce consumers’ choices.The plaintiffs, who first filed the suit in January 2005, asked for a minimum of $350m and alleged that Apple used software updates to keep songs sold by competitors off the devices.In a statement, Apple welcomed the decision: “we thank the jury for their service and we applaud their verdict”.“Every time we’ve updated those products,” the statement added, “we’ve done it to make the user experience even better.”Patrick Coughlin, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said they plan to appeal.The jury was asked to decide whether Apple’s software improved its iPods or unfairly restricted what music could be played on iPods sold between 2006 and 2009. Apple’s iPods from that time played only songs synced from CDs or bought from iTunes, a limitation that the plaintiffs said violated antitrust law by forcing people to buy iPods to preserve their music.Coughlin had told the jury that updates wiped those songs off the players completely: “your iPod is basically a paperweight at that point.” He argued that the software helped Apple tighten its hold on the market for music players.William Isaacson, one of the attorneys for Apple, parried by discrediting the claim wholesale: “there’s not one piece of evidence of a single individual who lost a single song, not even a complaint about it.” He argued to the jury that the software updates almost invariably improved security or the ability to add movies and auto-sync features.“We now have a plaintiff and a case asking you to hold Apple liable for innovating,” Isaacson told the jury.The plaintiffs’ case was troubled throughout the trial’s brief duration. Two named plaintiffs were removed after Apple lawyers learned they had not bought iPods during the relevant years. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also threw out one of the plaintiffs’ claims after the plaintiffs’ expert witness admitted he did not know whether an update made any difference.In the trial’s final days the case continued to change: over the weekend the plaintiffs added a wholly new charge that Apple and Amazon had colluded. Gonzalez Rogers barred the attorneys from even presenting the new allegation. She told the jury to keep to the charges at hand, and to remember that “a company has no general legal duty to assist its competitors, including by making products interoperable”.Jurors were shown emails between Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Jeffrey Robbin, chief of software, in which Jobs warned Robbins about software that could circumvent iTunes. Jobs pressed Robbins to improve anti-piracy software, writing “there is no gray area on theft”. Apple’s lawyers used the emails to argue that Jobs and the executives wanted to stop hackers, and were not interested in stifling competition, as the plaintiffs alleged.Jobs himselftestified to jurors in a videofilmed months before his 2011 death. He said “we were very scared” that hackers would crack Apple’s security and jeopardize the company’s contracts with music labels.Apple stopped using digital rights management software in 2009.
Amazon has told selling partners who have lost tens of thousands of pounds aftera software glitch led to their stock being sold for 1pthat they will not get compensation from the online retailer.The company, which had sales of more than $74bn (£48bn) last year, has emailed sellers to tell them that “as of now Amazon will not be providing any reimbursements for this issue”.In an email seen by the Guardian, an Amazon “seller support” worker said: “I completely understand how stressful this time may be.“As of now Amazon will not be providing any reimbursements for this issue. You will need to contact the third party software who are responsible for this error.”The email to Go2Games, which estimates it lost £10,000 as a result of the glitch, signs off with “have a nice day”.Sellers report that RepricerExpress, the third-party company behind the faulty software, has also not offered compensation. The Derry-based company has said it is “truly sorry for the distress this has caused our customers”.Amazon would not say whether it carried out due diligence into RepricerExpress’s software reliability.Daniel Pizzey, who said his baby clothing company Baby Best Buy has lost £25,000-£30,000 as a result of the glitch, said: “I am totally disgusted at the way Amazon has dealt with this matter.“Their reactions have been so slow and they have not once cared about the financial situation facing their sellers, especially at the most important time of the year.“For a company the size of Amazon, and also being one of the biggest companies in the world, they have failed as a company and not cared about our items in which they are meant to have a duty of care to look after them while they are in their possession.”Pizzey said his company was swamped with 30-40 orders a minute during the 1p glitch on Friday night. “Customers were ordering like 40-50 of the same items and just paying 50p for it. Surely Amazon would have picked up on this and questioned it before sending it out?”Amazon, which said on Monday it had “reached out to all the sellers that were affect”, declined to comment on Tuesday.
At first glance, the removal of mass-murder simulator Hatred from Valve’s Steam digital distribution platform seems like a rare example of corporate responsibility.While “mass-murder simulator” sounds like a tabloidism, the sort of description preachy moralists give to games like Grand Theft Auto, it’s an accurate description of Hatred. Produced by developerslinkedto Polish far-right groups, the game is explicitly and solely about setting out to shoot innocent people. With an aesthetic that emphasises the brutality of the player’s actions, it is a thoroughly nasty concept.So news that Valve had removed the game from Greenlight, the main entry point for indie games on to its Steam store, was greeted by many with relief.The company told Eurogamer that“based on what we’ve seen on Greenlight we would not publish Hatred on Steam. As such we’ll be taking it down.”In a world where a harassed politician has to fight to get explicitly antisemitic abuseremoved from Twitter, it’s refreshing to see a company act quickly to remove hate.But there’s something about the seeming capriciousness with which Valve made the decision to pull Hatred that makes me uncomfortable.The company has an undeniable level of power in the PC gaming space. Last year, it controlledan estimatedthree quarters of the global market for digital PC games, a market which is itself92% of the overall market for PC games. That proportion seems likely to have gone up since, and with the launch of SteamOS, there are now a few customers who have no choice but to buy their PC games from the store.For a company wielding that level of power over a creative medium, Valve owes more explanation of its process than a two-sentence statement. And for any developer wanting to stay on the right side of what the company would publish on Steam, its entire content guidelines are given in one sentencein its FAQ:Your game must not contain offensive material or violate copyright or intellectual property rights.Hatred isn’t the first game to have been pulled from Steam with scant explanation. In 2012,sex game Seduce Me was taken off Steam, and the company’s spokesperson told Kotaku that “Steam has never been a leading destination for erotic material. Greenlight doesn’t aim to change that.”Of course, if your erotic material is presented through the lens of a triple AAA game - like GTA V’s strip clubs - you can be sure that Steam will happily accomodate your product. And if your mass-murder simulator is made in a slightly more parodic fashion, as with 2011’s Postal 3, it will still be welcome on Steam as well.It’s not just Valve’s platform. Apple’s App Store has the same problems. On the one hand, it has a far more comprehensive set of guidelines, which at least allow developers a bit of help in working out what games will be accepted into the store; on the other hand, those guidelines are applied with wild inconsistency.The critically acclaimed Papers Please, for instance, was forced to self-censor after breaching a rule about “pornographic material”, which Apple defined as “explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings”. The game’s depiction of full-body scanners in use at the border controls of an authoritarian state is distressing and evocative, but fairly far from stimulating erotic feels. Nonetheless, Apple put its foot down.The internet is increasingly controlled by a few powerful gatekeepers. Steam, Apple’s App Store, Google search and Facebook’s news feed all have a level of concentrated power over our cultural and social discourse that has rarely been seen in history.Against that background, old canards about companies having the right to stock what they want are increasingly worn out. Nation states evolved a justice system, and rule of law, precisely to exercise their power responsibly, fairly and predictably.But in far too many situations, the best response companies can provide artists wanting to know if they are going to be censored is “wait and see”. And if they fall foul of an unknown rule, there’s no jury, no appeals process, and rarely any explanation.In the case of Hatred, it’s hard not to feel that Valve made the wrong decision. That’s not because there’s nothing objectionable in the game, but because a ban plays into the developers hands. Their game had already been cynically marketed to supporters of the Gamergate campaign as something that “social justice warriors” would hate, to the extent thatfans were asking for downloadable contentwhich would add women like Anita Sarkeesian into the game as murder targets. Removing it from the Steam Store just plays into that image as “the game they tried to stop”.What’s more, the opacity with which Valve makes its decisions means that there is nothing to point to to counter that impression. Rather than letting a cynical game die in obscurity, it’s now poised to become the forerunner of the 21st century equivalent of video nasties.
Name:KPC.Age:Alarmingly new.Appearance:More sinister than you could ever believe.Kuwait Petroleum Corporation? Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase? Kentucky Pried Chicken?None of the above. For the purposes of this piece, KPC stands for Keeping Parents Clueless. It’s a new internet acronym.And that’s sinister why?Because it’s whatyourteenage children are definitely typing into the internetright now, as part of their attempt to hide their wild drug-fuelled sex romps from you.What? My kids are taking drugs and having sex?Of course they are. If you forensically scrutinised your children’s online chat logs whenever they leave the room, you’d know this. But you don’t do that because you’re a bad parent.My God, you’re right! What else should I be looking for?Have you ever seen your kids type “1174” on to the internet?You know, I think I have.It means they’re planning a party at a secret location. Oh, and once they’re there, they’ll probably indulge in some heavy KOTL.KOTL?Kissing on the lips. Then they’ll say “GYPO” (get your pants off), or “IWSN” (I want sex now) before indulging in their “DOC” (drug of choice).That sounds terrif … wait a minute, drug of choice?Yes. Your definitely drug-addicted children definitely write “DOC” when they’re discussing the drugs they’re imminently about to take.But my kid’s 13. Thirteen-year-olds don’t say “drug of choice”. That sounds like something a clueless middle-aged parent would make up. Did you hear this on an episode of Brass Eye?No, it’s from a recent CNN report entitled28 Internet Acronyms Every Parent Should Know.Oh, I get it. This is one of these scaremongering reports designed to give kids a bad reputation and make you feel bad for being a shoddy parent.Fine, don’t believe me. Just don’t come crying to me when you discover your children 8ing all over the place.I don’t know what that is.When a teenager types “8” on to the internet, it means they are requesting oral sex. Every single time! Even when they’re doing maths!You’re being ridiculous. Goodbye.No, don’t go! LMIRL! That means “Let’s meet in real life”! I’m very lonely.Do say:“LOL.”Don’t say:“IWSN.”
Dutch authorities could fine Google as much as £12m (€15m) for online privacy breaches.The search company is failing to abide by the data protection act in the Netherlands by taking users’ private information such as browsing history and location data to target them with customised ads, according to the country’s Data Protection Authority (DPA).The Dutch regulator has given Google until the end of February to change how it handles the data it collects from individual web users.Google has also been under investigation in Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain for its handling of user data since introducing new company guidelines two years ago.Jacob Kohnstamm, DPA chairman, said: “This has been ongoing since 2012 and we hope our patience will no longer be tested.”‘An invisible web of our personal information’Google captures data from search engine queries, emails, third-party websites tracking or “cookies”, location data and YouTube browsing to customise advertising.“This combining occurs without Google adequately informing the users in advance and without the company asking for consent. This is in breach of the law,” the DPA said.Kohnstamm said Google’s practices “catch us in an invisible web of our personal information, without telling us or asking our permission”.The authority ordered the company to start informing users of its actions and seeking their consent or face fines of up to €15m (£12m).A spokesman said that Google was disappointed with the Dutch DPA’s order because it had already made several changes to its privacy policy in response to the regulator’s concerns.“However, we’ve recently shared some proposals for further changes with the group of European data protection authorities and we look forward to discussing with them soon,” he added.•UK privacy watchdog intervenes in hearing over Google’s use of web data
Every time it rains, you’re here in my headLike the sun coming outI just know that something good is going to happen.Kate Bush, CloudbustingLondon, June, 2014. Georg Backer and I are standing in the White Space gallery, just a few hundred yards from the chaos of Leicester Square. We have organised an indie games event called Radius. We don’t know if anyone is going to come. We’re tired and emotional; I’m still jet-lagged from E3, Georg, a freelance games producer, is on about seven deadlines.“Are people going to come?” I ask him. We look at the chattering groups of game developers setting up their computers on the trestle tables lining the walls. Some of them have flown over from Europe; one has driven from France. They want to show off their games – they’re here because it can be expensive to attend these things, and we don’t charge. But what if no one comes?And then at 10am, the doors open and people flood in, and they don’t stop until the place is full. I could have cried with relief.And then, so many fun, brilliant, clever games. I loved LA Cops, described by developer Modern Dream as a cross between Hotline Miami and David Hockney. I loved the local multiplayer fighting game Gang Beasts, and the promising sandbox exploration sim, TerraTech. I loved A Good Snowman is Hard to Make. It was amazing to meet the team from Verse Publications who built a Minecraft cocktail robot. We had people like the Counter-Spy team, just dropping in, finding a space and showing off their games. We had families coming in and playing together. We had fun.2014. Not a classic year for games. Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are still too fresh for development teams to really exploit effectively; there have been some high profile disappointments; there have been a lot of technical failures. Turns out that worldwide server networks can be a bit jumpy when tasked with servicing the needs of millions of gamers all trying to access the system simultaneously. Who ever saw that coming?And then there was Gamergate. Gamergate. Whatever the hell that word even means; a compound noun of anger and indignation. Four months in and who knows if any of its ostensible aims have been achieved. Asking for more transparency and better ethical policies from gaming sites that the whole movement hates and has boycotted anyway seems pointless. And if the group is anti-censorship then trying to rid the games industry of overtly progressive politics – however annoying or damaging or insidious – is hypocritical. Hypocracy and hysteria have pock-marked the last half of the year.Then came GameCity, always a highlight, always an oasis of gaming pleasure and camaradarie. This year the festival took over an old job centre in the creative quarter in Nottingham and stuffed it with interesting, provocative and sometimes really silly stuff. I took my family. My wife doesn’t play games and thought she’d be bored. But she thoroughly enjoyed Ana Ribiero’s weird yet fascinating virtual reality game Pixel Rift and joined in with our sons to play fantastic little titles such as hack-n-slasher Super Sword Shield Shield and the hilarious Realistic Anteater Simulator by Liselore Goedhart and Tom Francis, in which two players compete as anteaters to eat ants with their super long combative tongues.I played Doppelganger, Nix, Induction and Sky Scrappers, which were all great, and I’ll write more about them next year. But I also met a whole bunch of interesting, thoughtful and talented developers. People like Christos Reid who makes games about depression and anxiety, but also love and hugging. People like Space Budgie, the young development team behind Glitch Space, a sharp, minimalist action adventure which teaches key programming techniques through physics puzzles.They sat with my son Zac for a long time, helping him through their demo. He is autistic so the idea of sitting with strangers and experiencing a new game within a crowded festival environment was pretty worrying for him, but everyone made him welcome and comfortable. It was one of his highlights of a very difficult year. He has some big battles ahead. Games are going to be a source of solace to him. I keep reminding myself of that as the whole community sometimes seems to be crumbling.Friendship and inclusivity. So long the buzzwords of gaming culture. There are lots of places they still mean something. I went to the Nine Worlds Convention in August, with its emphasis on ensuring the comfort and safety of all those who attended regardless of gender or sexuality or whatever. There were inspiring talks on sci-fi, games and comics. Kelly Kanayama was brilliant on the subject of the silent female assassin in comics; there were great talks on time travel, neurohacking and the symbolism of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. If you’re a game writer or designer you’ve got to go to this next year.Sometimes you have to get away; you have to look at a troubling situation from another perspective. Twitter and gaming forums can turn games culture into a vortex of spite; it is easy to demonise people who appear on a feed, or in a forum post, as a faceless enemy construct. But they are people. They’re just people.At GameCity I spentan hour with Zoe Quinn. We’ve never talked before, we may never talk again. It was one of the hardest interviews I’ve ever done. The feature that came out of that was a deliberately human story. Some have said it was one-sided. Maybe it was. I was on the side of the complicated people who can often find themselves on the hot end of a Twitter inferno. Perspective and context sometimes get jettisoned in the rush to be heard.I’m an optimist. The industry will work itself out. The blockbuster studios will click with the new technology; the community rifts will heal somehow. I hope for positive resolutions. The thousands of people who don’t like the games journalism they’re getting can create and support their own; the game sites can work toward transparency without compromising on their editorial visions, or completely distancing themselves from developers.Despite some of what 2014 has thrown at me and my colleagues, 2014 has done nothing to shake my belief in one key thing: games journalism – like game development – is not something that can be done well in total isolation. Unless all you’re doing is regurgitating press releases, you have to get out there. You have to meet people, you have to be impressed and inspired by them. This is a cyclical, inward looking medium at times; you have to get out there. Or let other people in.June 2014. For a few hours, I was worried that no one would want to come and look at a bunch of strange, interesting games. But they did. I was silly –of coursethey did. The room was always full, and bustling and friendly and alive. That is what I’ll take from 2014.And that is my advice from this transitional year. When it is possible, when you can face it, try to fill the room. Just know that something good could happen.
Al Franken has criticised Uber’s “lack of detail” to his questions about the ride-sharing service’s privacy policies.The senator, who chairs the subcommittee onprivacy, technology and the law, wrote to the company last month setting out 10 questions after a spate of incidents that he said indicated a “troubling disregard for customers’ privacy”.The Democratic politician and former comedian asked what steps the Uber was taking to limit access to its “god view”, which lets employees track customers’ movements, and how it plans to improve internal privacy training to ensure policies are complied with.Katherine Tassi, Uber’s managing counsel for privacy, has written athree-page letterto Franken in response to his queries in which she insisted that the company was committed to rider privacy and only collected the information needed to provide the service.“It is neither unusual nor unexpected for a business to use the data of its customers as necessary to provide the service, to improve the service, and to run the business,” she wrote.In response to the controversy over “god view”, Tassi wrote that the ability to use the feature was now restricted to employees in operations or other areas such as fraud prevention who needed a “real-time view of trips”.‘Poor judgment’Franken said he was pleased that Uber hadresponded to his questionsbut was concerned about the “surprising lack of detail”. “Quite frankly, they did not answer many of the questions I posed directly to them. Most importantly, it still remains unclear how Uber defines legitimate business purposes for accessing, retaining, and sharing customer data. I will continue pressing for answers to these questions.”In the letter, Tassi also addressed the question of whether an employee had accessed the details of a BuzzFeed journalist. She wrote that Josh Mohrer had twice done so while communicating with her but had been open about his actions. “Although Mr Mohrer believed he had a legitimate purpose for doing so … Uber regarded his judgment in this instance to be poor and disciplined him accordingly,” she wrote.Her letter also reiterated that Uber had hiredHarriet Pearson, a data privacy expert, and her colleagues at law firm Hogan Lovells to carry out an in-depth review of its privacy policies and practices.Uber has faced more negative publicity this week afterintroducing surge pricingin central Sydney in the wake of the lockdown prompted by Monday’s cafe siege.

Microsoft has released its first preview of Skype Translator, which allows real-time conversations between spoken English and Spanish and will be extended to more languages.The service wasfirst demonstrated in May, aping Star Trek’suniversal translatoror theBabel Fishfrom The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, translating a conversation between German and English.It is now available as a free download for Windows 8.1, starting with spoken English and Spanish along with more than 40 text-based languages for instant messaging.Gurdeep Pall, Microsoft’s corporate vice-president of Skype and Lync, said in ablog postthat Skype Translator would “open up endless possibilities”, adding: “Skype Translator relies on machine learning, which means that the more the technology is used, the smarter it gets. We are starting with English and Spanish, and as more people use the Skype Translator preview with these languages, the quality will continually improve.”Users can sign up for the preview to try the service, but only if they are using the latest version of Windows.A demonstration of Skype Translate in the classrooms of American and Mexican children.Skype Translator is part of Microsoft’s artificial intelligence research relying on machine learning and deep neural networks, much like Google and Apple’s voice assistants. It can understand speech and then rapidly translate it into another language before using text-to-speech systems to speak the translation back to the user, or in this case the other party.Microsoft hopes that the system will break down language barriers, although the accuracy of its translation will be vital if it is to be relied upon to speak in a foreign language.The more people use the preview the more data the Skype team will have to improve the translation.“Skype Translator records conversations in order to analyse the scripts and train the system to better learn each language,” explained Mo Ladha and Chris Wendt, two of Microsoft’s research managers ina blog post. “Participants are all clearly notified as the call begins that their conversation will be recorded and used to improve the quality of Microsoft’s translation and voice recognition services.”The calls are broken down into small snippets, anonymised and stored on Microsoft’s servers to feed into the statistical models that help improve word matching.Science fiction has long promised seamless translation between languages, removing barriers between nations and species. Skype Translator is the first piece of technology that begins to get close to a “universal translator”, although video calling is unlikely to help travellers on their holidays anytime soon.• Doctors’ surgeries in England and Wales are to offerout-of-hours appointments over Skype
More than 11,000 websites using the WordPress blogging platform have been blacklisted by Google, after they were infected by the “SoakSoak” malware.Security firm Sucuri, whichfirst reported on the blacklisting, claims that the malware’s impact could be far wider though, stretching to “hundreds of thousands” of sites.SoakSoak modifies a file in infected sites’ WordPress installation, then loads a Javascript malware from the soaksoak.ru domain – hence the name.Sucuri claimed that SoakSoak isusing a vulnerability in the RevSlider WordPress pluginthatit first spotted in September, but which is often used within WordPress themes, meaning website owners may not have known they needed to update it.“The biggest issue is that the RevSlider plugin is a premium plugin, it’s not something everyone can easily upgrade and that in itself becomes a disaster for website owner,” wrote Sucuri’s Daniel Cid.“Some website owners don’t even know they have it as it’s been packaged and bundled into their themes. We’re currently remediating thousands of sites and when engaging with our clients many had no idea the plugin was even within their environment.”Cid added that even when website owners try to clean the two affected files in their WordPress installation, they may be swiftly reinfected.“This campaign is also making use of a number of new backdoor payloads, some are being injected into images to further assist evasion and others are being used to inject new administrator users into the WordPress installs, giving them even more control long term,” he wrote.“Some users are clearing infections and getting reinfected within minutes and the reason is because of the complex nature of the payloads and improper cleaning efforts.”Rival security firm Kaspersky’s Threat Post blog noted thatthere are more than 70 million websites running on WordPress, although there are no figures for how many of them are using the RevSlider plugin.Security researcherGraham Cluley suggestedthat Google’s decision to blacklist more than 11,000 affected domains soon after the attack was publicised was “a quick-thinking reaction which hopefully will make it more difficult for the attackers to monetise their cybercriminal campaign”.Meanwhile, affected site owners have been figuring out how to get their blogs cleaned up and back on Google.

Controversial mass-shooting game Hatred has been removed from Steam, the biggest digital gaming download site.The project, developed by Polish studio Destructive Creations, was submitted to the site’s Greenlight section, where users vote on whether new titles should be sold via the service. Within three hours, however, the game had been removed by Steam operator Valve Software.Described as a “genocide crusade” by its creators, Hatred features a lone sociopath who must explore a range of environments shooting civilians and police officers, while gathering extra weapons. The only motivation is to kill and keep killing.First announced in October, the game has attracted widespread condemnation. Software company Epic Games, which distributes the Unreal Engine used to develop the title, quicklyasked for its logos to be removedfrom the trailer.“Based on what we’ve seen on Greenlight we would not publish Hatred on Steam. As such we’ll be taking it down,” Valve spokesperson Doug Lombarditold gaming news site, Eurogamer.Destructive Creations has, in turn, published a statement on its own site: “We of course fully respect Valve’s decision, as they have right to do so. In the same time we want to assure you that this won’t in any way impact the game development, game’s vision or gameplay features we’re aiming for. The game is still to be released in Q2 2015 as planned.”Amid widespread unease at the game’s themes and motiveless violence, a sizeable community has grown in support of the title. Just before it was removed from Steam, Hatred had attracted 13,148 “yes” votes supporting its inclusion on the site. Only 1,061 “no” votes were recorded. A video trailer of the game on YouTube has been viewed over 180,000 times.The game will now need to be sold through other digital distribution stores or via its own dedicated site, though Steam utterly dominates the PC gaming market with over 100m active accounts. The site still features similarly themed titles such as Manhunt, a grueling horror game in which the player is forced to “star” in a snuff film, and Postal, about a disenfranchised worker who goes on a killing spree.Valve’s decision to remove Hatred comes days after Apple initially rejected the award-winning simulation Papers Please for inclusion on the App Storedue to its brief depiction of nudity. It also follows the decision by Australia retailers Target and KMart toremove Grand Theft Auto Vfrom their shelves after an online petition criticised the game for its depiction of violence against women.All of these stories have raised questions about the power of retailers and platform holders to control and censor content.However, the situation has also provided a small previously unknown developer with plenty of what studios in the digital marketplace really need: publicity.“We don’t treat this as a failure because yet again this showed us a huge community support we’re totally overwhelmed with,” reads the statement on the game’s official site.“The whole situation only pushes us forward to go against any adversity and not to give up. It also makes us want to provide our fans Hatred pre-orders sooner, as many of you have asked for them”
After a bruising year for streaming music service Spotify, chief executive Daniel Ek admits the company is thinking hard about how to convince artists like Taylor Swift of its value to their careers.“What it has highlighted for us is we need to do a better job explaining to artists how streaming benefits them,”Ek told music industry magazine Billboard, of the dispute with Swift that saw her remove her entire back catalogue from Spotify.“The point that’s been lost is that Spotify’s the fastest-growing revenue source the industry has. There are many artists to whom, through the labels, we’re paying out millions a year already. Those cheque sizes will just keep increasing.”The key toSwift’s decision to pull her music from Spotifywas the company’s refusal to allow her to make it available to the company’s12.5 million paying subscribers, but not to its 37.5 million free users.According to Ek, that policy isn’t changing. “Right now we don’t allow that,” he told Billboard:“There’s a lot of other places where you can access that music for free, so our view is the only thing that happens by not being in the free service is that the consumer then has to go to another service to get the song, and they will.If they stay on the free service there’s a lot more likelihood that the consumer ends up becoming a paying subscriber, thereby generating more revenue. And then on top of that we’re paying a considerable amount every single time someone does play a song, whether it’s on the free tier or the paid tier. It’s something that we keep on discussing internally but right now our stance is the same as it has been before.”However, Spotify is planning to make its subscription service more appealing in 2015 in an effort to persuade free users to start paying, with Ek suggesting labels are keen to help “build even more content and put in the subscription” next year.“Just like we’ve had deluxe edition of albums, everyone is thinking about how does that look like in a future world?” he said. “Lossless music – is that a higher priced tier? Is that something that comes with deluxe editions? How should we package subscriptions to consumers? That’s a very big topic right now on the label side.”He’s not wrong, judging by comments made to analysts by Warner Music Group’s chief executive Stephen Cooper as he announced that label’s latest financial results, asreported by Recode:“In our view, right now, enabling meaningful global growth in the number of paying subscribers is the best option for artists, for songwriters, for copyright owners and for the services themselves.Subscription streaming is not only a fantastic offering for music fans, it will propel the long-term health of the music industry. We look forward to continuing to work closely with our partners to turbo-charge the adoption rate for subscription streaming.”Spotify may be the biggest subscription music service by some distance, but withYouTube having recently entered the marketandApple lurking ahead, Spotify’s ability to “turbo-charge” its subscriptions in 2015 will be key to its future – and to its chances of ever,evergetting back together with Taylor.•Streaming music: how CAN artists make it pay?
A raid by Swedish police hastemporarily sunk filesharing site The Pirate Bay, but one of its administrators claims to be unworried by its failure to set sail again yet.“We were not that surprised by the raid. That is something that is a part of this game. We couldn’t care less really,” the administrator, using the pseudonym “Mr 10100100000”,told TorrentFreakin the site’s first official comments since the raid.“We have however taken this opportunity to give ourselves a break. How long are we supposed to keep going? To what end? We were a bit curious to see how the public would react.”There have been no marches or notable online protests, while the site’s former spokesperson Peter Sunde has even suggested that The Pirate Bay’s death is long overdue.“TPB has become an institution that people just expected to be there. Noone willing to take the technology further,” hewrote in the days following the raid. “The site was ugly, full of bugs, old code and old design.”Mr 10100100000, who is one of “30-50” people involved in running The Pirate Bay in 2014, told TorrentFreak that its fate remains up for internal debate. “Will we reboot? We don’t know yet. But if and when we do, it’ll be with a bang,” he said.“The people behind TPB are like one big collective mind. There are no leaders nor any one in charge. About 30-50 people from all over the world pitch their ideas against each other and whatever comes out of that is what will be the fate of TPB.”One reason for the lack of fierce protests at the site being taken offline is the availability of other, more modern services for filesharers to use – not to mention the copies of The Pirate Bay that have popped up online since the raid.Another filesharing site, Isohunt,put up a new clone of the site“in order to save it to the generations of users” using a copy of its database of links and search engine made before the site went offline.•Does it really matter if The Pirate Bay stays offline?
If you’re trying to make sense of Google’s Year In Search – previously known asGoogle Zeitgeist, also known as Stuff You’reReallyInterested in Looking At When You’re Not Too Busy Lying About Your Love of Proust – you could do worse than cite Donald Rumsfeld. Hard time though Rummy gets, he was right about at least one thing. There are the Known Unknowns, and then,as he pointed out, there are the Unknown Unknowns. And with search queries, as with the development of a counterinsurgency strategy, it’s the second category that’ll really give you pause.Scan Google’s lists of popular terms in the UK this year – which divides our interests into categories that range from movies to geography, businesses to dead celebrities, and is published today – to see what I mean. There are the big stories of the year, of course, from the Scottish referendum to the World Cup to the death of Peaches Geldof. And it’s hard to think of three words more deadeningly of the moment than “Kim Kardashian selfie”.But there are also lots of timeless things you’ll genuinely want to find out more about: your known unknowns. “Who is Banksy”! “Where is Broadmoor”! “Pancakes”! Who doesn’t want to know about pancakes – or, indeed, about “What is love” or “Paris”? These are timelessly interesting things to learn about, and only of the zeitgeist in the same way that kittens and sunsets are: give a Wi-Fi-enabled laptop to a ninth-century monk, one suspects, and he wouldimmediately seek out a funny cat video.Yolo selfies, Zoella and crochet … 2014 was made of thisAgainst that reassuring sense of historical continuity is a more troubling raft of searches: ones for that might as well be in Klingon for all they mean to the average person (by which I mean: to me). These are your unknown unknowns. “Yolo Selfie”? “Lohanthony”? The “Green Coffee Diet”? But I don’t see how only living once can be compatible with taking selfies! I wouldn’t drink coffee if it was green! I can barely figure out if Lohanthony is a human being or a new variety of hybrid courgette! (As it turns out,Lohanthonyis a YouTube sensation, which doesn’t necessarily make the answer any clearer.)Mostly, I blame teenagers. It follows that to complain thus is like shaking your fist at the sky, or getting cross aboutElvis gyrating on primetime TV. Still, for anyone who yearns for evidence that the world is not completely dominated byFlappy BirdandZoella, there are crumbs of comfort to be had. More people searched for ebola than searched for the celebrity photo hack; more people want a recipe forVictoria spongethan forcake pops. Best of all, “how to crochet” is way ahead of “how to twerk”. Move over, Miley: your bum-wiggling is so 2013. This is the year of the chain stitch.
The space station hovers in the near distance, its entry port slowly rotating as you approach. To dock successfully, your ship must exactly match this gently turning circle – miss it and you’ll collide catastrophically with the station’s exterior. At first, you think you have it, but then a heavy touch on the joystick sends you off pace. Sod it, you hit the docking computer button. The Blue Danube plays as you safely float in.If that scenario means anything to you, the chances are, at some point in the 1980s, you had your mind blown by a space simulation game called Elite. With its vast galaxies, its vibrant interplanetary trading system, its orbital routes clogged with pirates, smugglers and alien invasion craft, it was a revolutionary experience.The original game, released on the BBC Micro computer in 1984, was followed by two sequels of contentious quality, but now it is back again with a fourth iteration – the biggest and most ambitious yet. Elite: Dangerous is a massively multiplayer online fantasy, taking place in an accurately mapped version of the Milky Way, complete with 400bn star systems. Set in the year 3300, the game allows players to live their own lives, exploring, trading, fighting and assassinating – all the while earning cash to upgrade their basic starship.For the past year, the game has been in a testing phase, allowing fanatical fans to explore its new systems and features, feeding back to Frontier Developments, the Cambridge-based studio working on this gigantic project. To many of those people, it isn’t just a game – it is a connection to an experience that had a profound effect on them. It is their Star Wars.Players can purchase a range of craft designed for fighting, exploring or trading. There are two flight modes: a traditional flight assist option and a more tricky Newtonian option, which adds complex physics to the handlingPhotograph: Frontier Developments“I first came across Elite on the Commodore 64 back in 1985 and was immediately captivated by it,” says Odhrán McConnell, who is one of many players returning to the game as a public beta tester. “I was learning to program at the time, so I soon found out how to crack the game to give myself hundreds of thousands of credits and to kit my Cobra Mk. III craft with military lasers and a host of other equipment. I then explored the galaxy in earnest, blasting raiders and thargoids to pieces.”It’s a familiar story. Elite was always more of an interactive space movie, than a simulation. Its simple vector graphics allowed participants to fill in the details with their own imagined conflicts and situations. The room in which you played the game became your spacecraft; your friends were your crew. “I first played a pirated copy of Elite around 1988,” admits beta tester, Simon Hildrew. “My friend Russell and I used to spend hours each night after school trying to trade up. I remember pre-ordering Frontier: Elite II for my Amiga - it came with a vast fold-out map – I’d spread it out over the table and ponder where I might go next …”Elite: Dangerous promises to provide that familiar experience of exploration and combat, but in a much more complex environment. Spacecraft and space stations are now detailed 3D models, planets are scaled correctly; trading prices will alter in real-time depending on player activities. This is a truly living, interactive universe.“It was the space stations that made the biggest impression on me when I first joined the premium beta,” says Justin Pinner, a software developer at the Guardian who has also been playing the beta version of the game. “They’re not only interesting, and in some cases beautiful to look at, they’re also credible spaces – places you could really imagine exploring. The first time I docked was one of those OMG moments when I realised that I’d just done what I’d only been able to imagine as a teenager. The environment that Frontier has provided is not only accessible but visceral too.”Hildrew agrees. “My first trading trip from one station to another was a surprisingly immersive,” he says. “The detail of the game mechanics, graphics, sound and music really combine to create this very enjoyable experience. Beyond the cockpit, I find the galaxy map viewer provides a fascinating perspective of our milky way. When I first realised you could zoom all the way out, I spent the next 20 minutes looking at stars hundreds of light years away. It gives this awesome sense of scale.”In the background there is a narrative involving three warring factions,the Empire, the Federation and the Alliance, battling it out to control the galaxy. Players will be able to take on paid and philanthropic missions for any of them, although becoming too closely aligned with one will apparently make you anoutlaw in certain systems. Indeed, everything you do feeds into the ongoing narrative. “Choosing to help any given side will affect the power balance in that region,” says Pinner. “This could lead to civil wars as the system evolves – it isalready going onin at least one place that I know of: the star system of Lugh.”The game uses a similar 3D radar as the original, now rendered into an authentic cockpit displayPhotograph: Frontier DevelopmentsIt’s not been an entirely smooth flight for Frontier though. Some fans were annoyed by the high cost of joining the beta test (initially £100), others were angered when the planned offline mode was cancelled. You’ll need to be online to play the game now.“There’s also a bunch of bugs, some of which have been reported as far back as the alpha builds, that have not been addressed particularly promptly,” says Hildrew. “One example is having had my ship explode on me on a couple of occasions when trying to dock, seemingly due to some sort of collision detection error. Another example is the many systems whose maps show asteroid belts that cannot in reality be flown to. This makes mining frustratingly hard.”But then Frontier knows what buttons to press in order to keep its fanbase onside. The company recently held a fan event at RAF Duxford, complete with a 1:6 scale model of a Cobra spacecraft, and an up-to-date version of the game running on 4K monitors, as well as the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. “That was just incredible,” says Hildrew. “The resolution isn’t quite there yet, but it’s a very intuitive and immersive way of playing the game. You can look around the inside of your cabin, but more importantly you can follow an enemy ship far more intuitively, only needing to resort to the radar screen if it goes into a blind spot.”In the future, the studio is promising players the ability to actually explore the interiors of their ships, and to touch down on planets. These will be necessary additions when rival space games like the similarly ambitious Star Citizen and the more indie-focused No Man’s Sky arrive next year. Elite was once alone in its sandbox universe, but now others are coming for its user-base of space fantasists.But then, there is something special about Elite still. Like Star Wars, it bridges gaps between an imagined future and an idealised past. One player has alreadyspent £3,000 building a custom cockpitin which to play the game, complete with an array of ultra HD screens. There’s going to be a huge boost in sales of flight joysticks – the best way to handle the game’s Newtonian flight model. Elite was always about living in the game. If Frontier can iron out those bugs, if it can manage a seamless online performance, the players will do the rest. The players always did.Elite: Dangerous is out now on PC.Elite: Dangerous – combat, trading and exploration beyond the stars
Tech and media companies, privacy groups and leading computer scientists all filed legal briefs on Monday backing Microsoft in a case against the US government it claims is “fundamental to the future of global technology”.Microsoft ischallenging a government orderto hand over emails held on servers at its datacenter in Dublin, Ireland. The company has lost twice in court but is challenging the order in the US court of appeals for the second circuit in New York.Technology companies including Apple, Amazon, Cisco, eBay and Verizon all filed in support of Microsoft. As have two of the US’s largest business organizations, the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, as well as media organisations including ABC, CNN, Fox News and the Guardian.The unusual level of cooperation among often fiercely competitive organisations comes as privacy advocates argue the US is overreaching its authority in a manner that will set a dangerous precedent for government access to online information across the world.“We believe that when one government wants to obtain email that is stored in another country, it needs to do so in a manner that respects existing domestic and international laws. In contrast, the US government’s unilateral use of a search warrant to reach email in another country puts both fundamental privacy rights and cordial international relations at risk,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, said in ablog post.At a press conference organised by Microsoft, Victoria Espinel, president and chief executive of the software industry trade group BSA (The Software Alliance), said: “We need to think carefully about the precedent that could be set here.”She said that allowing the US government to use the US courts to access emails stored in Ireland would allow other governments to make similar moves and demand access to information stored in the US. Such a move would damage trust in the technology sector, reduce productivity worldwide and harm privacy, she said.News organisations, including the Guardian, have expressed concern that a victory for the US would allow Washington to go after information stored by newsrooms in the cloud. “We have stuff governments around the world want. This case may not be about digital journalism but the next case will be,” said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.The case centres on a drug investigation currently being conducted by US authorities. Smith said the legal system already had practices in place for international crime investigations and that using the US courts to reach documents stored overseas was unnecessary and dangerous. He said in most cases Ireland already handed over documents to the US when asked through its own courts.“The US has well-established treaties with countries around the world that allow them to seek the information they need while ensuring that citizens of other countries retain the privacy protections offered by their own laws and courts. And there’s ample opportunity for work to modernise these agreements further,” he said.
Amazon has come under fire for failing to help the small family-owned businesses that have lost tens of thousands of pounds aftera technical glitch caused their products to be sold for a penny.The firm, which had sales of more than $74bn (£48bn) last year, has ignored calls to offer compensation to its selling partners, some of whom have lost up to £100,000 in the week before Christmas.The sellers, many of whom are operating from their garage or spare bedroom, have demanded Amazon take some responsibility for the error caused by a third-party software glitch. Some have already instructed lawyers.Amazon has accepted no liability for the losses suffered by its sellers, from whom it takes a slice of each sale helping it to make annual profits of $20bn.Last year Amazon sold goods worth £4.3bn in Britain – more than the UK sales of Argos, Dixons or the non-food arm of Marks &amp; Spencer. It paid just £4.2m in UK tax.On Monday the company claimed that it had “reached out to all the sellers that were affected”, but many complained that Amazon would not speak to them on Monday.On Sunday, Amazon said it was working to stop any more 1p orders being dispatched from its warehouses, but sellers reported shipments were still being sent out on Monday afternoon – almost 72 hours after the glitch occurred on Friday night.The company that made the software causing the accidental sales bonanza issued a second apology on Monday, but has not offered compensation to sellers.Brendan Doherty, chief executive of RepricerExpress, said: “I understand that this issue comes at the most important time of the year for our customers and I am deeply sorry by the disruption that has been caused. “We take a lot of pride in the levels of service we provide so everyone here is disappointed that our customers have experienced this issue. We will continue to work to provide the highest levels of service we can in order to regain the trust and confidence of our customers.”The company, which boasts on its website that it provides “the ridiculously simple way to increase your Amazon holiday sales”, refused to speak to the Guardian.Some sellers have already instructed lawyers to take action against RepricerExpress but expressed concern that the company, which operates from offices above a pub in Derry, could collapse if it pays out compensation claims.Norman Younger, who suffered big losses when hundreds of products from his Just Catering Supplies company in Manchester were sold for 1p, said he had no hesitation in suing RepricerExpress. “They’re a very small outfit, they’re likely to go bust, but they should have thought about that shouldn’t they,” he said.“Amazon should take a certain responsibilty. Amazon always go on about the importance of the customer experience, what about our experience?“You can’t expect to screw people into the ground, and then not help them out when something goes wrong. It would be nice if they could help us.”Younger said an Amazon employee had told him that the company would “sort it out” but had not explained what it planned to do. “I’d like to think they would follow through on their word, but we’ll have to wait and see.”Another seller, Stuart Cameron, has instructed lawyers and has asked other sellers to join him in joint legal action against RepricerExpress and Amazon.His lawyer Nick Dewhirst, of Little Man Law, said: “The only recourse is to look at the person who caused the loss. He [the chief executive of RepricerExpress] appears to have held his hands up in that his company made an error.”Craig Constantinides, chief executive of computer games retailer Go2Games, said his company has lost £10,000 but could have lost more than £300,000 if the firm had more stock in Amazon’s warehouses, from which orders are sent out automatically.“It’s very difficult to understand how this can have happened, thousands and thousands of pounds lost in minutes,” he said. “We have only had automated responses. No one will call us. A phone call would be nice, even it is just to say sorry.“Amazon is going to stand very far back from all this. You would expect a juggernaut like Amazon to step in and help.”
When hackers attacked Sony Pictures recently, the greatest fears of Hollywood studio executives – and surely the wildest dreams of their assistants – came true. Thanks to the as yet unidentified, reputedly butactually probably notNorth Korean hackers, juicy details of executive salaries and executive emails have been thrown open for all to see. Here are five things we have learned so far:Hollywood executives are mean …An email exchangebetween producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal involved a spirited discussion about Angelina Jolie’s desire to have David Fincher direct her in Cleopatra, instead of Fincher taking on a film about Apple mogul Steve Jobs. Rudin did not want Jolie, whom he called “a minimally talented spoiled brat” getting involved with the production of the Jobs film. Laboring the point, Rudin, went on to say that the “brat” “thought nothing of shoving this off her plate for 18 months so she could go direct a movie [Unbroken] … She’s a camp event and a celebrity and that’s all and the last thing anybody needs is to make a giant bomb with her that any fool could see coming.”… and casually racist …Pascal, while discussing a breakfast at which she would be meeting President Barack Obama, asked Rudin: “Should I ask him if he like DJANGO” – a reference to the Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained, which is about a freed slave. She continued with this line, asking if she should see if he liked Lee Daniels’ The Butler, about a black man who served eight US presidents, and Think Like a Man, an ensemble romantic comedy featuring many prominent black actors. Think Like a Man actor Kevin Hart spoke out against the comments, as did TV megastar Shonda Rhimes,who called the exchange “racist”.… and they don’t get paid the same …Sony’s chief executive, Kazuo Hirai,makes about $1.5m. Nine executives below Hirai made as much, or more, than their boss, including Sony movie studio executive Michael Lynton, who made $3m.… and female actors are paid differently tooOscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence. Not worth as much as her co-stars, apparently.Photograph: Adrees Latif/ReutersEmails showed that Jennifer Lawrencemade less than her male co-starsin American Hustle. In an email exchange between executives, it becomes clear that Lawrence is making less. “You may recall Jennifer was at 5 (amy was and is at 7) and WE wanted in 2 extra points for Jennifer to get her up to 7. If anyone needs to top jennifer up it’s megan. BUT I think amy and Jennifer are tied so upping JL, ups AA.” “AA” and “Amy” are Amy Adams, the film’s other female lead; Megan is Megan Ellison, head of the company that financed the film with Columbia.They also gently bend scripts to suit foreign marketsFor The Interview, a comedy about assassinating the supreme leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, executives considered making the ending less violent. In an email to Hirai, Pascal wrote: “There is no face melting, less fire in the hair, fewer embers on the face, and the head explosion has been considerably obscured by the fire, as well as darkened to look less like flesh.”
Google has denied it was closing down Google News in Spain as part of a strategic bargaining campaign by the search company.The threat comes after legislation due to come into effect in Spain next month that will compel aggregators such as Google News and Yahoo! to pay for republishing snippets of content from news providers.Google said last week it wouldshut its news service in Spainon Tuesday before the new law, as it would not be sustainable, and remove Spanish publishers from Google News sites worldwide.‘Negative impact’Benoît Keane, of Brussels law firm Keane Legal, said: “Google could be playing hardball as it knows it will have to pay but wants to bring the down the cost as low as possible. Publishers are the small fry here – Google is a partner they almost cannot do without.”A Google spokesperson said: “The new law requires publishers to charge Google News for showing even the smallest snippets of their content - whether they want to charge or not. As Google News itself shows no ads and makes no revenue this approach is simply unsustainable.”Despite having helped campaign for the new law, the Spanish Newspaper Publishers’ Association (AEDE), has now called on Google not to close its news service because its “dominant market position” would “undoubtedly have a negative impact on citizens and Spanish businesses”.The body has called on the Spanish and European Union authorities to “protect the rights of citizens and companies”.Keane said that given Google’s market dominance in search, Spanish publishers could have a credible case to bring against the company if it did carry out its threat to close down its news service in Spain.Google has argued that it sends millions of readers to news sites, allowing them to make money via online advertising.‘The big losers will be media firms’Closing Google News in Spain could affect smaller news publishers than more prominent sites that readers access directly. Referrals from news aggregators such as the Google service range between only 8% and 21% of traffic for Spain’s top five sites -ElPais.com,Elmundo.es,ABC.es,LaVanguardia.comandElPeriodico.com, according to figures from SimilarWeb. Social networks such as Facebook make up a smaller amount.The Spanish web users’ group, Asociacion de Internautas, said: “The big losers will be media firms themselves, which, with the disappearance of their news from the search engine, will lose traffic to their pages.”Spanish media companies have been hit hard by the credit crunch as advertising spending has plunged, with dozens of newspapers closing costing thousands of journalists their jobs in recent years.In October a legal battle with German publishers prompted Google to remove news snippets taken from news sites from its search results. However, Axel Springer, Germany’s largest publisher, capitulated last month after its online traffic plunged.The row comes amid a growing campaign by European politicians and regulators to restrict Google’s power over the online search market and its personal privacy policies.•Google News: the secret sauce
Apple’s 2014 Christmas advert, titled “The Song”, has arrived – and it’s an emotional affair; not so much tugging at the heart strings as picking at them one by one like price tags on presents.The advert depicts a teenage girl finding an old 45rpm recording of her grandmother, Valerie, singing the jazz standard “Love is Here to Stay” to her late husband, Raymond, in 1952.We then see the teenager recreate the song, using software on an Apple Macbook Air laptop, to turn it into a digitally remastered duet.The 90-second spot ends with granny Valerie listening to the thoughtful DIY gift on heriPad mini 3, crying while looking over a picture of her and Raymond, on Christmas morning.There’s no doubt this is a touching effort from Apple’s marketing team: it’s bound to cause a lot of tears wept into mince pies and sherry glasses. I’ll admit to feeling mildly affected.However, there are a few things we all need to address here. Namely, what kind of empathy-void sociopath ruins her grandmother’s Christmas by reminding her of herdead husband? The love of her life,who is dead. Look how sad Valerie is:Valerie, crying. Making an old lady cry is never cool.Photograph: YouTubeTears glistening on her cheeks, like little orbs of memories; fragments of a life lived with Raymond.Second: let’s be honest, Valerie doesn’t really give a shit about her granddaughter’s duet.Valerie is just straight up into the fact Santa brought her brand new iPad mini 3, cos now she’ll be able to watchRuPaul’s Drag RaceandDon’t Tell the Bridefrom her bed.There’s also the fact that the granddaughter, who sits smugly on the stairs in the dark at the end of the video – I’m gonna use the word lurking, in fact – has the audacity to just rifle through Valerie’s stuff to even stumble upon the record in the first place.Excuse me, but Valerie isn’t dead yet. Valerie isn’t Raymond. Have some respect. One can’t just rifle through a grandmother’s things in the hope of finding something special in the hope of inheriting it.Just rifling through Valerie’s stuff.Photograph: YouTubeLastly, all of this brilliant creativity courtesy of Apple’s products is slightly undermined by the disclaimer across the advert that “additional hardware is required”. And software. Basically, buying GarageBand is on you, kid.Well, well, well…Photograph: YouTubeChristmas-themed adverts have become a pop-culture staple. John Lewis’ annual festive televisionspotis hotly anticipated; and Sainsbury’s also made a morally dubiousadvertthis year, featuring the Christmas Day football-inspired temporary ceasefire of the first world war.Meanwhile, Apple’s adverts are also regularly greeted with fanfare for being memorable or including big names or popular music. Past examples include: theadfeaturingFeist’s “1,2,34”; the “Get a Mac” advert imagining human embodiments of Macs and PCs, and the recent “Stickers” campaign.None of those however, were responsible for breaking Valerie’s heart.•Apple iPad mini 3 review: a touch more of the same
The Pirate Bay has resurfaced after beingtaken offlinelast week by police raids in Sweden.Rival piracy site Isohunt claims to have put up a new clone of the site including a copy of the Pirate Bay database of links and its search engine made before the site was taken offline.“We, the Isohunt team, copied the base of the PirateBay in order to save it to the generations of users. Nothing will be forgotten. Keep on believing, keep on sharing!” said the Isohunt teamin a blog post.‘We’ll take this buster down for good’The new Pirate Bay site features a functioning search engine and appears to contain some of the original site’s database, although the Guardian cannot confirm its authenticity.Since the Pirate Bay was sunk by Swedish authorities, a variety of clone sites have appeared in its wake.The site’s resurrection by Isohunt appears to be temporary, with the site’s operators claiming that “if PirateBay recovers we’ll take this buster down for good”.‘Ugly, full of bugs, old code and old design’The Pirate Bay has seen momentary removal from the internet before, but this extended period offline could be the final nail in its coffin.Even co-founder Peter Sunde said that perhaps it was time for the site to stay offline.“[The Pirate Bay] has become an institution that people just expected to be there. No one willing to take the technology further. The site was ugly, full of bugs, old code and old design. It never changed except for one thing – the ads. More and more ads was filling the site, and somehow when it felt unimaginable to make these ads more distasteful they somehow ended up even worse,” Sunde wrote in a blog post.“The original deal with TPB was to close it down on its tenth birthday. Instead, on that birthday, there was a party in its ‘honour’ in Stockholm.”•Does it really matter if The Pirate Bay stays offline?

Although it is not always obvious, most games, particularly shooters, are politically charged. While the first-person games I grew up playing were mainly concerned with emulating the second world war (Medal Of Honour, Call Of Duty), over the past 10 years or so, new theatres of conflict have emerged: the Middle East, Africa, South America, Asia.And in games such as Delta Force: Land Warrior, Full Spectrum Warrior, Counterstrike, as well as the modern versions of the Call of Duty and Medal of Honor franchises (which have switched to commonly Arab enemies), the heroes come with guns, grenades and American accents. The overwhelming narrative is that there are clear heroes and villains, and the heroes are strong, militant, and ready to kill.London-based game developers Paolo Caravajal and Vinay Chaudhri are trying to challenge that. Their game, Ramzi’s Rumble, is a platformer, which aims to subvert the traditional narratives of victim and villain – with some of their own political agenda thrown in.Developed in June over snatched weekends and evenings, Ramzi’s Revenge sees a young boy Ramzi, who comes home to find his land invaded by settlers. It’s not subtle, but the game is focused on a clear and pointed agenda: to raise the issue of illegal occupation.“At the heart of the conflict is the story of someone big taking something from someone small,” says Chaudhri. “It’s about the systematic injustice being carried out against the occupied Palestinian people. We felt we needed a new approach to telling an old story. Gaming involves people in a much more immersive way. We wanted to experiment with a new medium, to see if that could disrupt and refocus the discussion.”Fortunately, the platform format ensures the game is not as complex as the issue – with only four characters, (Ramzi, Settler, Soldier, and Builder) it has a relatively simple conceit. The aim is to help Ramzi save his land by throwing pebbles at construction workers, dodge their hammers, and squash soldiers.Co-developer Caravajal says that the simplicity of the design is deliberate. Despite seemingly making light of complexity, the game is aimed at adults, and they hope to give it an age restriction at a later date. The project is currently onKickstarter and is picking up support.Games as provocationBut is it too provocative? Critics may argue that the uncompromising message is pro-Palestinian propaganda. “It’s not meant to be,” says Caravajal. “What the game is doing is addressing a very specific issue, about illegal settlements. It is not about religion or politics, it’s about illegal occupation. A bunch of folks stealing land and homes from other people. The supreme court in Israel rejects settlements, as do the international community, the EU, many Jews and non-Jews.”Mainstream gamers being challenged to politically engage on global issues is arguably no bad thing – and it is becoming more common. Last year saw the release of the critically acclaimed Papers, Please, a simulation that puts players into the role of a border guard controlling immigration into a fictitious eastern European state. And released in November, This War of Mine from Polish studio 11Bit, is based around helping civilians to survive in a war-torn city. Like those titles, a game that focuses on illegal settlement is a chance to create discussion.Sarah Colborne, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, supports their ambition: “Israel’s settlements in the West Bank are just one aspect of Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian land, and are rightly condemned by the UN and by governments worldwide, including our own,” she says. “Using video games to get that message across is a novel way to continue to raise awareness, and, hopefully, to reach new audiences of people who will then join their voices with ours to end injustice.”Certainly, the concept of the little man fighting back is a theme that most gamers will recognise – it’s just that here, the man in question represents a different culture than we’re used to.So is this kind of social commentary going to become more common in gaming? Chaudhri certainly hopes so.“In games, movies and comics, Arabs are rarely the good guys. So there are millions of intelligent young minds out there, playing shoot-‘em-up games for hours on end, where the heroes are American special ops machos and the villains are swarthy foreigners.“When [players] see real-world stories about those guys, it’s hard to empathise with them on a human level, because they’ve been the bad guys until then. How are you supposed to feel when those same ‘bad guys’ are the victims of a bombing or an invasion?”This War of Mine – gaming’s sombre antidote to Call of Duty
Ubisoft; PC/PS4 (version tested) /Xbox 360/Xbox One; £45; Pegi rating: 12+Watch the gorgeous promotional CGI sequence after loading up The Crew and you’ll witness what could may be the best driving game ever made.There is a breathless, beautifully rendered sequence in which a four-car team working in perfect automotive unison eludes the police while snaking through downtown New York traffic, blasting along sprawling American highways, and conquering the rough terrain of the wild west. All this in thrilling vehicles ranging from muscled up V8s to supercars to raid-prepared rides. And all this within a vast world populated by hundreds of online players.But The Crew isn’t that game.The real experience, when you get past the rousing CGI advert, is a disappointment. At least until you’ve spent a few good hours in the driving seat.The immediate disillusionment, particularly for anyone coming to this from Forza Horizon 2 – this generation’s closest competitor to The Crew – are the visuals. There are notable touches, such as the detailed textures covering a downtown lamppost, the sunset over a rocky desert horizon, or the high tree count for most of the game’s wooded areas, but there can also be a functional, almost last-gen feel to the graphics.Then there’s the handling. The Crew offers three options, ranging from hideously assisted to an erratic but liveable Hardcore mode. As you level up and install upgrades, as well as unlock the other categories of cars, things do improve. But the driving dynamics are simple and the model never engages you in the way that FH2 or even Driveclub does. And at times, particularly during off-road treks, its limitations are painfully apparent – frustrating, in fact, when it causes you to repeatedly fail a mission.Players start our driving a Street ride and subsequently open up Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit variantsPhotograph: Ubisoft PRMeanwhile, the narrative, which focuses on your journey as a former street racing gang member looking to avenge your brother’s murder, does little to engross. No one expects characterisation on a par with The Last of Us in a driving game, but what’s on offer here is about as engaging (and predictable) as a drive in a Renault Twingo, with much of the dialogue seemingly lifted from a rejected The Fast &amp; The Furious script.We could spend the entire review pointing out what’s wrong in The Crew. There’s horrendous rubber-banding in races; police cars keep pace with even the most able of race-spec machinery and appear to draw you in with supernatural magnetic force, making it unfairly difficult to escape arrest; the audio mix is poor, comprehensively failing to convey a powerful engine note, even after you’ve switched off the limited selection of radio tracks; and too often, the course design used for the story-based missions proves uninspiringWant more? Well, the side and rear view mirrors don’t work; the GPS system (cleverly designed to appear in the sky) will often reset itself when playing in coop. You’ll also note framerate wobbles, as well as glitches that violently flip your vehicle for no apparent reason. Player stats seem unable to log properly. The presence of micro transactions jars, as it often does. PvP events can find it difficult to pin down participants – there are often disappointingly few other players in your session. The list goes on.Dawn in the USAThe Crew’s strength, however, lies not in the show it puts on, but rather the stage it’s set on.If everything’s big in America, then everything ismassivein The Crew’s persistent, open-world equivalent. The scale of the play area, which models the full USA (and partly explains the graphical compromises lamented earlier), is such that it takes a while to adjust. You’ll spend the first hour or so disenchanted that everything looks a little brown, a little samey, then you realise that despite all the mileage you’ve put in you’ve yet to leave the Detroit area you start in. Once you do venture further, you soon appreciate how vast and varied the playground you’ve been given is. Weather, landscape, topography, vegetation, wildlife, architecture, even vehicle density (and type) alters convincingly according to your position within these digital United States. Coast to coast, the GPS will map you out a route some 70 miles long – this is a gameworld which makes GTA V feel tiny.Where Rockstar’s game effortlessly trumps Ubisoft’s, however, is in how that world is conveyed. Despite its astonishing enormity and diversity, The Crew’s environment doesn’t often feel alive. Yes, its over-sized cities boast pedestrians, Michigan farmlands herd cows, you’ll frighten bison on the dusty plains of Texas, power past bears while climbing the Northern Rockies, and try to avoid hitting deer (and tree trunks) in the game’s dense forests, all the while a variety of birds look on from their lofty roosts. Yet the implementation of all this wildlife, as with other aspects of the game, comes across as overly mechanical, artificial – there’s never a moment when things feel truly organic.What The Crew can boast over its contemporaries is a density of content to match the scale of its playscape. The main 65-mission story will see you take on rival car gangs in an effort to win control of the map’s five main factions – Midwest, East Coast, The South, Mountain States, and West Coast – which obviously serves as a way to get you to experience the wide range of environments available, and pleasingly you can invite up to three friends or nearby strangers to help you out along the way.But that’s just a fraction of what’s available. Hundreds of engaging skill mini-challenges and tempting discoverable points, numerous PvP and Faction events, plus additional community-focused trials keep you constantly busy while working towards maxing your XP (the game’s generous levelling system means that even semi-determined play will hit the Level 50 cap after some 25 hours) and boosting in-game currency.The layers of complexity, although perplexing at first, are ultimately welcome. There’s a fully featured skill tree model (Perks), for instance, which sees you able to improve a number of elements: anything from boosting XP rewards, to increasing your car’s braking efficiency, to reducing the price of tuner parts.You can personalise your ride via a generous selection of options – both cosmetic- and performance-based – all implemented via visual sequences that petrolheads will never tire of watchingPhotograph: Ubisoft PRYou can fast travel to any area you’ve already visited, or use the airports and train stations to get you across the country (for a fee), but the finest way is to simply drive and discover. Not on your own, because there’s very little sense of occasion provided by the game when you do come across world famous landmarks such as, say, Mount Rushmore, Yosemite National Park, or the Hoover Dam. But go exploring with pals and the game takes on a new dimension.When we took a road trip from New York to LA road trip, the journey was packed with incident. Unexpectedly helping a stranger with their police trouble; the aesthetic reward of swapping the leafy autumnal looks of Washington for the lush pine population of Central Woods; trying (and failing) to forcibly stop a cargo train in New Mexico followed by watching the sunset while perched on the edge of a huge meteor crater. Then, the night we blasted across the straights of Arizona under a blanket of stars; spying LA’s lights while roaring into Laguna Beach; arriving at our destination bathed in dawning sunlight. Not wanting the ride to end, we headed to the Laguna Seca circuit, where a spontaneous race with fellow players took off. It was one of the best play experiences of the year.The Crew offers these moments of emergent gameplay for those willing to go find them but, tragically, doesn’t have them naturally stitched into its design upholstery. As such, the potential is too often unpicked by the game’s frustrating shortcomings. When it all comes together, and in the right company, what you’re left with is a good American road trip. But it could have been a great one.
Sony Pictures has demanded that news organisations stop reporting on the information stolen by hackers in the crippling attack on the studio.The demand was sent to media companies in a three-page letter written by Sony Pictures’ lawyers Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner after a wave of highly embarrassing data releases by hackers.“Sony Pictures Entertainment does not consent to your possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading or making any use of the stolen information,” the letter read.‘No choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss’The company also asked recipients to “destroy the stolen information” and added: “If you do not comply with this request, and the stolen information is used or disseminated by you in any manner, Sony Pictures Entertainment will have no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination.”The data was stolen as part of an attack by hacker group Guardians of Peace on Sony Pictures that crippled its entire computer network and forced employees back to using pen and paper.The data included film scripts, five movies, personal details including medical records of actors and past and present Sony employees, payment details, user names and passwords and email archives for a number of top studio executives.‘Sony Pictures into the worst state’The hackers have threatened to continue releasing data including a “Christmas gift” that “will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting. The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state,” they added.The group also sent a message to Sony Pictures employees saying that it would not release their private data if you “tell us your name and business title”.The origin of the hackers is still unknown, although North Korea remains a possible culprit despite denying it was behind the sophisticated attack that would have challenged even government cyber-defences.•Hackers ‘may attack other film studios after leak of Sony Pictures’ data’•Sony hack would have challenged government defences – FBI
