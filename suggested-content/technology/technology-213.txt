It looks like US developer Thatgamecompany is going to have to clear some more space in its already bulging trophy cabinet – the studio's poetic adventure title Journey is nominated in eight categories at this year'sBritish Academy Games Awards. Amid the 17 categories, survival horror hit Walking Dead and open-world shooter, Far Cry 3 have also received a lot of attention.For the first time, the event, which takes place in London on 5 March, will include a Best British game category. It's a mix of indie titles and console big-hitters, with two racing stars, Need For Speed: Most Wanted and Forza Horizon, slugging it out against experimental oddity Dear Esther and compelling puzzler, The Room. 2012 was clearly a good year for UK indie talent with Mike Bithell's Thomas Was Alone, Ed Key's Proteus and Dene Carter's Incoboto also making it into several categories. Scottish team 4J Studios is also in there for its fantastic conversion of Minecraft to the Xbox 360.Elsewhere, action epics Mass Effect 3, Halo 4 and Far Cry 3 are battling it out on a range of fronts spanning Best Story, Best Actions Game and Best Game. The latter lines up Dishonored, Far Cry 3, Fifa 13, Journey, Mass Effect 3 and The Walking Dead.Perhaps the big shock is only two nominations for XCOM: Enemy Unknown, one of the 2012's most critically acclaimed titles. It is represented in the Best Design and Best Strategy Game sections, but nowhere else.Once again, the awards also feature the Ones to Watch category, which recognises student developers from theDare to Be Digitaldevelopment competition. This year's competitors, Pixel Story, Project Thanatos and Starcrossed all show great potential.Here's the complete list of nominations:ActionBorderlands 2Development TeamGearbox/2K GamesCall of Duty: Black Ops 2Development TeamTreyarch/ActivisionFar Cry 3Dan Hay, Patrick Plourde, Patrik MetheUbisoft Montreal/UbisoftHalo 4Development Team343 Industries/Microsoft StudiosHitman: AbsolutionDevelopment TeamIo – Interactive/Square-EnixMass Effect 3Development TeamBioWare/EAArtistic AchievementBorderlands 2Development TeamGearbox/2K GamesDear EstherRobert BriscoeThechineseroom/thechineseroomFar Cry 3Jean Alexis Doyan, Genseki Tanaka, Vincent JeanUbisoft Montreal/UbisoftHalo 4Development Team343 Industries/Microsoft StudiosJourneyDevelopment TeamThat Game Company/Sony Computer Entertainment EuropeThe RoomMark Hamilton, Rob Dodd, Barry MeadeFireproof Games/Fireproof GamesAudio AchievementAssassin's Creed IIIMathieu JeansonUbisoft Montreal/UbisoftBeat Sneak BanditSimon Flesser, Magnus "Gordon" Gardebäck,Simogo/SimogoDear EstherJessica CurryThechineseroom/thechineseroomFar Cry 3Dan Hay, Tony Gronick, Brian TylerUbisoft Montreal/UbisoftHalo 4Development Team343 Industries/Microsoft StudiosJourneyDevelopment TeamThat Game Company/Sony Computer Entertainment EuropeBest GameDishonoredDevelopment TeamArkane Studios/Bethesda SoftworksFar Cry 3Dan Hay, Patrick Plourde, Patrik MethèUbisoft Montreal/UbisoftFIFA 13David Rutter, Nick Channon, Aaron McHardyEA Canada/EAJourneyDevelopment TeamThat Game Company/Sony Computer Entertainment EuropeMass Effect 3Casey HudsonBioWare/EAThe Walking DeadDevelopment TeamTelltale Games/TelltaleBritish GameDear EstherDaniel Pinchbeck, Robert Briscoe, Jessica CurryThechineseroom/thechineseroomForza HorizonDevelopment TeamPlayground Games/Turn 10 Studios/Microsoft StudiosLEGO: The Lord of the RingsDevelopment TeamTT Games/Warner Brothers Interactive EntertainmentNeed for Speed Most WantedDevelopment TeamCriterion Games/EAThe RoomMark Hamilton, Rob Dodd, Barry MeadeFireproof Games/Fireproof GamesSuper HexagonTerry Cavanagh, Niamh Houston, Jenn FrankTerry Cavanagh/Terry CavanaghDebut GameDeadlightRaul Rubio, Luz Sancho, Oscar CuestaTequila Works/Microsoft StudiosDear EstherDanielPinchbeck, Robert Briscoe, Jessica CurryThechineseroom/thechineseroomForza HorizonDevelopment TeamPlayground Games/Turn 10 Studios/Microsoft StudiosProteusEd Key, David KanagaTwisted Tree Games/Twisted Tree GamesThe RoomMark Hamilton, Rob Dodd, Barry MeadeFireproof Games/Fireproof GamesThe Unfinished SwanIan Dallas, Nathan GaryGiant Sparrow/Sony Computer Entertainment EuropeGame DesignBorderlands 2Development TeamGearbox/2K GamesDishonoredDevelopment TeamArkane Studios/Bethesda SoftworksFar Cry 3Patrick Methè, Jamie KeenUbisoft Montreal/UbisoftJourneyDevelopment TeamThat Game Company/Sony Computer Entertainment EuropeThe Walking DeadDevelopment TeamTelltale Games/TelltaleXCOM: Enemy UnknownDevelopment TeamFiraxis/2K GamesFamilyClay JamChris Roem Iain Gilfeather, Michael MovelFat Pebble/ZyngaJust Dance 4Alkis Argyriadis, Matthew Tomkinson, Veronique HalbreyUbisoft Paris/UbisoftLEGO Batman 2: DC Super HeroesJon Burton, Jonathan Smith, John HodskinsonTT Games/Warner Brothers Interactive EntertainmentLEGO the Lord of the RingsDevelopment TeamTT Games/Warner Brothers Interactive EntertainmentMinecraft: XBOX 360 EditionDevelopment TeamMojang/4J Studios/Microsoft Studios Xbox LIVE ArcadeSkylanders GiantsPaul Reiche, Fred Ford, Scott KragerToys For Bob/ActivisionGame InnovationCall of Duty: Black Ops IIDevelopment TeamTreyarch/ActivisionFezDevelopment TeamPolytron Corporation/Microsoft Studios Xbox LIVE ArcadeJourneyDevelopment TeamThat Game Company/Sony Computer Entertainment EuropeKinect Sesame Street TVDevelopment TeamSoho Productions/Microsoft StudiosThe Unfinished SwanIan Dallas, Nathan GaryDevelopment TeamGiant Sparrow/Sony Computer Entertainment EuropeWonderbook: Books of SpellsDevelopment TeamLondon Studio/ Sony Computer Entertainment EuropeMobile &amp;

A quick burst of 11 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamWho's manipulating Apple stock with this iWatch story? &gt;&gt; ReadWriteDan Lyons:who's manipulating Apple stock now, with this sudden barrage of "leaks" about the iWatch?Does no one else think it's kind of remarkable that this unreleased product suddenly starts showing up in dozens of blog posts and press stories? And that these leaks happened, coincidentally, right after Apple's stock endured a brutal slide from just above $700 in September to a low of $435 in January?If the suggestion is that Apple is selectively leaking these details to help its share price, its executives could be prosecuted for failing to supply financially sensitive information equally to all investors. Those executives will already know this. Could it be, on the other hand, that wearables is just a hot field?amendlocke: I recharged my cigarette ... &gt;&gt; Twitter"I recharged my cigarette, blocked a sex robot from my timeline, and followed an astronaut. Then I wrote a science fiction story."Microsoft, Apple summonsed to explain high prices &gt;&gt; ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)Technology giants Microsoft and Apple have been summonsed to appear before a federal parliamentary committee to explain why Australians are forced to pay more for some of their products compared with other countries.The committee has also issued a summons to Adobe, with all three companies to appear before a public hearing on 22 March.If they fail to turn up they could be held in contempt of Parliament, which carries a range of possible penalties including fines or jail time.The companies have provided written submissions to the committee but have declined several requests for them to appear in person.The investigation was set up after a long campaign by Labor backbencher Ed Husic, who has accused some information technology companies of "ripping off" Australian consumers.We'vewritten about this in the UK as far back as 2006(though nothing much changed). Can Australia get something to happen? (Thanks @rquick for the link.)Windows 8 at 90 days: Q&amp;A with Tami Reller &gt;&gt; Windows Team BlogMicrosoft interviews itself:It's been a little over 90 days since Windows 8 reached general availability (GA) so naturally people are asking: how is Windows 8 is doing? I thought the best way to address this would be a Q&amp;A with our Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Financial Officer Tami Reller to share context and our point-of-view. So here we go...Brandon LeBlanc:We announced in early January that Windows 8 has sold more than 60 million licenses. How does that compare to previous versions of Windows?Tami Reller:More than 60 million licenses sold is on par with the record setting pace we saw with Windows 7. We feel good about our start with Windows 8 - and of course there is still much more to do.Something about the indeterminacy of that figure is odd. Windows 8 was released at the end of October; in the three months since then, more than 85m PCs should have been sold.Google: Self-driving cars in 3-5 years. Feds: Not so fast &gt;&gt; ExtremeTechIt's a free country and if you want to mount a soap box and speak out in a public park, you can do it today. If you want to sell a motor vehicle, you have to meet an array of fuel-economy, stability, and crash safety tests, and those take time. Years sometimes. Self-driving cars would have to prove they can drive themselves, deal with jaywalking pedestrians, stop or at least slow when a crossing vehicle runs a red light, and deal with software glitches. Performance metrics for self-driving cars don't exist yet and the Department of Transportation, which doesn't offer bonuses for working at internet speed, may be more deliberate and methodical than Google.See below for the challenges that Tesla is having with its electric car. Unfortunately, there are many more questions over self-driving cars.Tesla CEO Elon Musk accuses New York Times of lying about Model S range anxiety &gt;&gt; The VergeIn a statement to CNBC moments ago, Musk reiterated that Broder hadn't followed the terms agreed upon by both sides. "We explicitly said that to do this trip, he needs to make sure he's fully charged when he starts out, that he doesn't take detours, and that he drives at a reasonable speed," he said. "I'm not talking about some ridiculously low speed, but not too far above the speed limit. Those three things weren't done."For its part, The New York Times is standing behind Broder's story as 100 percent accurate. Further, the publication insists its writer played by the rules.Isn't going to end well for someone.Kickstarter Open Source Death Star by www.gnut.co.uk &gt;&gt; KickstarterGoal: £20,000,000 for more detailed plans and enough chicken wire to protect reactor exhaust ports.Stretch Goal: £543,000,000,000,000,00 ($850,000,000,000,000,000) to secure full funding for actual construction.So far: £222K pledged by 1,570-odd people.

If everything goes according to the plan, the petit Strand-1 satellite will carry the first Nexus 487 miles above the earth's surface on the back of a rocket.According to the lead engineer Dr. Chris Bridges, Nexus One's hardware hasn't been modified in any way. "We've essentially got a regular phone, connected up the USB to it and put it in the satellite," he said.In a few years we're going to have Google, Apple and Microsoft competing furiously to land a phone on the moon, aren't we?No BlackBerry 10 prepay device before Christmas &gt;&gt; Mobile TodayBlackBerry will focus on mid and upper-tier BB10 devices through 2013, with no prepay models coming to market until next year.The manufacturer, who unveiled its BB10 phones last week, has had success with the prepay market, particularly among young people, and the move could disappoint retailers. Its 9320 handset was the bestselling Christmas handset, so the lack of a BB10 pre-pay device would leave retailers without a guaranteed hit.Europe MD Stephen Bates told Mobile the manufacturer would focus pre-pay sales on its existing BlackBerry 7 and 7.1 handsets. He said: 'With BB10 we are trying to establish a new platform. We are intending to expand the portfolio towards the mid-tier in 2013 and entry-level phones will come next year.'Stephen Bates with the snappy soundbites that have made him so famous. But if BlackBerry keeps selling its BB7 handsets, what's the problem?Charlie Brooker Q&amp;A: the drug of tech has us hooked. What's the side-effect? &gt;&gt;Wired UKWired.co.uk:When you say that technology has changed in such a short space of time, what's your personal experience of that?Charlie Brooker:Well, when I got my first TV writing job, which is like 1999 or so, I was sort of the nerd of the office. I remember I had an MP3 player, and I remember kind of explaining to people about how amazing this was, and no-one gave a shit. And then it cut to a few years later and everyone's raving about iPods and I felt slightly... aggrieved.And I think that's a massive thing that's changed over the last decade or so. Probably just over a decade, probably from the Millennium onwards. When the Millenium Bug was kicking around people would bemoan the fact that we were relying on computers and now nobody thinks twice about sharing everything they've got online.Good, thought-provoking interview.Bridge &gt;&gt; XKCDAnswering that question of "if everyone jumped off a bridge, what are the circumstances where you would too?"You can followGuardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard.

Apple has released iOS 6.1.1, a "bug-fix" version to sort out problems that had led a number of European phone operators including Vodafone towarn customers using the iPhone 4S not to update to its predecessor, iOS 6.1. That had been released two weeks before.The new release, which should be available through phones or can bedownloaded directly from Apple(968MB), is only available for iPhone 4S users.In aterse noteabout the update, Apple says that "This update fixes an issue that could impact cellular performance and reliability for iPhone 4S."Carriers had begun warning customers last week not to update to iOS 6.1 if they hadn't already done so; it said that 3G connectivity could be affected. The new software is meant to fix that.However other users with iPhone 5s havecomplained of excessive battery drain on iOS 6; Apple has not indicated whether it recognises a problem there.However Apple has apparently not fixed problems reported with all models of iPhones running iOS 6 - released in September - when connecting to Microsoft Exchange servers. That has led some corporate users toblock certain functionality relating to meeting invitations.Apple has not responded to requests to clarify its timescale for fixing the problems with Exchange accounts.

And how far could that metaphor go?Breaking the Law!Metallica performing in Istanbul. Photograph: Andy Fossum / Rex FeaturesThree years on and the pair have writtenHeavy Metal Management, a suitably monochrome alternative management bible complete with requisite gory photos of the 'uncompromising' Nifelheim, 'epic' Motley Crue and those masters of satanic symbolism, Watain.The Wealth of Nationsit is not, but it is an entertainingly extended metaphor that has definitely struck a chord with  the startup community; it was Sweden's best-selling book in December, and sold 10,000 Swedish-language ebooks in the first two weeks of January alone."Apart from the number of the beast – 666 – Heavy Metal Management isneverabout numbers. Did you ever hear a rock star talk about the key success factor being 'focus on shareholder value creation'? We didn't think so. In short, heavy metal management is all about doing your thing to the fullest, without looking in any other direction. We will prove that there are virtuous cycles also in Hell. In corporate lingo it's called 'the art of building sustainable long term customer relationships' or something totally lame like that..."Judas Priest in 1979. Photograph: Fin Costello/RedfernsBad to the Bone!The book makes most sense when it talks about storytelling, finding the right perspective to make that story appeal to people."Take the example of the investment company that almost never sells its portfolio companies, that only invests in companies the CEO (who by the way is way over 80 years old) understands really well (things like insurance agencies) and a company that never plays stock market dynamics by doing things like stock splits to make shares accessible to the wider public that can't afford to fork up $130,000 foroneshare..."Despite all that, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway is one of the most admired companies in the world, driven by the skillful, articulate storytelling that describes the inner workings of the companies he invests in.From BH's 2011 report: "We found that if you advertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will call hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels. A line from a country song expresses our feeling about new ventures, turnarounds or auction-like sales: 'When the phone don't ring, you'll know it's me.'"Some young people demonstrating the correct way to listen to Iron Maiden Photograph: Miguel A Lopes/EPAHighway to Hell!Pärson is a seasoned European VC in Europe, thrashing out a series of major deals to sit on the boards of Spotify, Russian classifieds site Avito and ad tool Videoplaza, but he also frontsFrank Xerox and the Perfect Copies; covers, and a decent voice. After years in the business world, he could be forgiven for craving some fun – and a decent soundtrack. But talking to him, it's clear that beneath the virtual leather codpiece and war paint he's deadly seriously about his heavy metal methodology."Be epic. Be a master. Be instinctive. Be sensory. Be forever. Be total."Pärson and Öberg started banging the drum for their new business strategy with that 'pentagram of six'; the framework that a startup needs a fantastic story and a vision, mastery of its craft and must 'trigger basic human instincts'. Is it surprising that an investor with a background at McKinsey has ditched the analytical approach?Licking the Vs: Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, playing at Sonisphere. Photo: Shirlaine Forrest/WireImageRaining Blood!An emotional connection between the employees, the company and its customers, Pärson explains, is now critical."We were singing the praises of the rational, methodical part of ourselves in analysing the businesses we were seeing. But look deep into the findings and successful companies are anything but analytical – they appeal to us emotionally. That's why they are successful at hiring people, why people with the same mindset come to work for them and how they attract customers. That emotional connection binds together."That connection should be sensorially appealing, and from a team that is committed and with a long-term vision, according to Heavy Metal Management. So far, so sensible. Elsewhere, wisdom of the crowds becomes 'wisdom of motherfuckers going apeshit', virality is actually 'spreading the pestilence' ('invented', we learn, by Metallica's Lars Ulrich who distributed mix tapes of local talent) while the line up is crucial.  The riff master pushes the product forward, the frontman engages with the crowd, the money man takes care of the business and the steady bass holds the team together.Ozzy Osbourne and Tony Iommi performing in Black Sabbath in 1985. Photograph: Rusty Kennedy/APSweating Bullets!"There is the potential for conflict between joint creative, commercial and ego-oriented objectives ... The issues get particularly difficult to manage when several people compete for the same role within the band, like in the case of the conflict between Dave Mustaine and James Hetfield during the very first years of Metallica. Dave is a brilliant songwriter and exhilarating guitar player with frontman qualities, but he was constantly stepping on James and Lars's toes. They wouldn't allow Mustaine to take the frontman role. We should be happy that Mustaine eventually got fired from Metallica because it gave the world Megadeth ..."Heavy Metal Managementis massively good fun, and it's not hard to see why it has proved so popular with a new generation of entrepreneurs hungry for a new language for their business strategy. It's music to their ears, epitomising the archetypal work hard/play hard ethos, the personal commitment, the experimentation and a kind of tribal recognition and respect.Photo byscragzonFlickr.Some rights reserved.Run to the Hills!The metaphor works so well it even extends as far as sexism (both casual and explicit), drugs (the notorious excesses of the tech party scene) and bad taste. Pärson doesn't even attempt to defend the sexism or the parties, but is pretty animated as he defends the bad taste. "It's about cultural codes and connections, and that can't be a bad thing," he said. "If you want to create some reaction, like the lead singer of Nifelheim, it's more theatre than bad taste.""Working with startups means working with people who are doing something profound, and they put enormous personal and financial commitment into that. That level of energy is rewarding to be around, and it's intellectually stimulating and challenging."Let us Slay!The next big industry to be turned up to 11 will be mobile, says Pärson. Just as the offline players of the 90s were pushed out by the creative disruption of the new online players, so will online be pushed aside by mobile. "We meet companies who were super hot three years ago, but are now losing momentum online and their ad revenue is shrinking. It's a new phase of creative destruction."If you're feeling suitably inspired and hell bent for leather, and are in need of some Bruce Dickinson to quote at your next board meeting, Heavy Metal Management is out in the UK in late March.For those about to rock, we salute you!!
Broadband campaigners say EU budget cuts hammered out last week will kill high-speed connections needed by rural homes and businesses, after it emerged the budget for rural broadband – seen as vital to creating new businesses – has been cut by €8.2bn (£7bn) to just €1bn.They also warned that the European parliament, which has to sign off the new budget, could block the cuts, which saw infrastructure investment plans of €50bn over seven years slashed to just €24bn – the largest slice of the €34bn in cuts pushed for by David Cameron.However, unrest among MEPs over the cuts to infrastructure spending could lead to some of the cuts being reversed when the budget comes to a vote in March or April."It's a giant leap backwards," said Brian Condon, a director of theCommunity Broadband Network, which provides support for community-based schemes. "In the UK, broadband policy is being dictated by the big players, which is characterised by two things – incrementalism and centralisation."The EC has an ambitious plan, theConnecting Europe Facility(CEF), which included a plan to enable broadband connections of up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps) for half of Europe's population by 2020, with the rest on 30Mbps.Of that, €9.2bn of funds were earmarked to help develop rural broadband, where long distances and low population density make high-speed systems initially uneconomic for private second companies.But the cuts mean that is now out of reach, said Charles Trotman, of the Country Land and Business Association. "This would mean it's up to member states or the private sector to put up the funding," he said. "It's highly unlikely that certain member states would be able to. Just a billion euros isn't going to be enough."Neelie Kroes, the European Commission vice president,criticised the cut, saying that "this funding will have to be exclusively for digital services: because such a smaller sum does not leave room for investing in broadband networks."Kroes said that although the 2020 targets "may be harder to reach" she was not giving up on them. "I will keep fighting," she said.But BT, which has won a number of contracts with UK government funding under its BDUK scheme, said that the budget cuts would not affect buildout of fibre here, because the BDUK budget was ring-fenced.BT said: "BT had no plans to make use of CEF and its reduction (from €9bn to €1bn) should have no impact on existing or planned funded projects, such as Cornwall, Northern Ireland or the BDUK process. We support the European Commission's ambitions to encourage widespread broadband deployment – the UK is seeing the fastest roll-out of any European country and this progress will continue."The Fibre to the Home Council, a pressure group pushing for wider buildout of high-speed connections, said it was "very disappointed" by the move: "The decision shows that there still is a lack of understanding of European governments on the importance of future-proof broadband networks."The EC reckoned the broadband investment could stimulate further investment worth €50bn, reaching 45 million households and more than 100 million people. "Investment in broadband will make Europe more competitive, will help build Digital Single Market and will create jobs," it said in the justification for the budget.The UK had been in the middle of the field for broadband until the budget cuts, Trotman said. "BT has said that it wouldn't be until 2017 to 2018 before it had adequate structures in place."
A couple of days later than usual, it's time for our weekly roundup of the newest and most notable new apps for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.Apps and games are included, with the price in brackets relating to the initial download of each app, so those marked (Free) may include in-app purchases.The latest Android roundupwas published on Friday. For now, read on for this week's pick of new iOS apps – and check out the separatefull review of Discworld: The Ankh-Morpork Map for iPad, which wasn't available at the time this roundup was published.Marie Claire Runway 3 (£2.99)This is the latest iPad app from Marie Claire magazine, focusing on the Spring/Summer 2013 fashion collections. It promises videos of key clobber trends this season, along with live footage of the New York, London, Milan and Paris fashion shows.iPadFootball Week (Free)A late-Friday release meant this just missed out on the last best iOS apps roundup, but it's well worth a look if you're a football fan. Future's digital-only magazine focuses on the English Premier League, with interviews and match previews, then live data piped in from the Press Association while matches are in progress. It costs £3.99 a month or £19.99 a year, with a new issue every week. Read morein our interview.iPadAfter Burner Climax (£1.99)Sega's famous dogfighting game franchise comes to iOS, promising an array of real fighter jets, 20 stages to fly through, and three game modes to test your airborne skills. It plays nice with Apple's AirPlay technology too, to play on bigger screens.iPhone / iPadMailbox (Free)Big things are expected of Mailbox, an email app for iPhone promising that it "puts email in its place". That means swipe-simple archiving and deleting, as well as chucking emails out of your inbox temporarily to focus on the important ones. Mailbox is controversial, though, for its first-come first-serve reservations policy: if you download it now, there are more than 730k people waiting in a virtual queue ahead of you for access.iPhonePaddington Bear's Adventures (£2.99)Paddington Bear has already starred in a book-app for iOS, but now he's got his own game too. Officially licensed, it includes five mini-games plus a dress-up mode, with an array of London scenes featuring – not to mention some suitably-sticky marmalade. Good fun for kids.iPhone / iPadDave (Free)British digital TV channel Dave – still "the home of witty banter" – has launched its first app. It's a simple but effective way to stream shows from Frank Skinner, Russell Howard, Dara O'Briain and others on an iPhone or iPad.iPhone / iPadThe Little Mermaid (£2.99)Developer StoryToys has made a name for itself with cute digital pop-up books based on various Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Now it's turning its attention to Hans Christian Andersen and The Little Mermaid, with a mixture of pop-up scenes, mini-games and easily-readable text.iPhone / iPadBadoo (Free)Chatting and dating app Badoo has been very popular on smartphones – as in 150m-people popular – as a way for people with similar interests to hook up. Now it's been redesigned for a native iPad version. Expect lots of on-screen thumbnails of possible partners, with chat sitting neatly alongside.iPadHinge (Free)More dating with this iPhone app, which is based on Facebook. The idea: "Just rate people in your extended friend network on Facebook, and Hinge lets you know whenever the feeling is mutual". Which, of course, does rather depend on lots of people signing up to Hinge if it's going to be useful...iPhoneTimbre (Free)The Songkick Concerts app has been a proven success at alerting people to upcoming gigs by bands they like. Its latest competition comes from Timbre, which just expanded outside the US. It recommends local concerts while also playing music by the artists so you can gauge how good they are.iPhoneHappier (Free)Gigs make me happy, but so do a lot of other things. Happier is an app that wants to help me (and you) track "happy moments you find in every day", while sharing them with friends and family who may or may not be a.) happy too or b.) interested. The theory behind it, though, is that focusing on happy moments and sharing them "makes you happier and healthier". Its challenge is to persuade lots of people they need a specific app for this, rather than just posting on Facebook or Twitter.iPhoneDon't Be Scared LP (£7.99)DJ Vadim has had a long and respected career making hip-hop, but he's not resting on his laurels in 2013. This album-app is a collaboration with British startup Immersive Album, offering interactive music, lyrics, artwork and videos in a whizzy 3D interface. I might describe it as the next Biophilia, if that wasn't a bit of anill-fated prediction.iPadReadmill (Free)Readmill has been available for a while on iPad, but this slick e-book reader app has now been squeezed down for iPhone too. It lets you read e-books in the ePUB, PDF and Adobe DRM formats, highlighting quotes, sharing to social networks, and commenting on other people's highlights.iPhoneBBC Sport (Free)BBC Sportlaunched an iPhone app in the UKin January 2013, but now a separate version has been released for international users. Features include news, live scores and stats for a range of sports, as well as live text coverage of various international events. Video will follow (as will an Android version).iPhoneBe Together (£0.69)Right from the earliest days – remember Rolando? – iOS devices have been tailor-made for rolly-around physics-puzzler games. Be Together is just the latest colourful example, as you arrange props on-screen to unite two rolly characters named Maya and Ruby.iPhone / iPadBeastie Bay (Free)Released for Android in 2012, Japanese developer Kairosoft's freemium game has now made the leap to iOS. It's a cross between Pokemon-style monster-catching and battling and FarmVille-esque village building, with characterful pixelly graphics and addictive gameplay.iPhone / iPadFaces iMake – ABC (£1.49)Robots made from saucepans and a Santa with an aubergine for a nose? Those are among the surreal charms available in Faces iMake – ABC. It's an educational alphabet app for young children, who have to reassemble the various characters made from household objects – one per letter.iPadZombie Typomaniac HD (£1.49)The Typing of the Dead famously turned Sega's The House of the Dead zombie lightgun-shooter games into educational typing titles. Zombie Typomaniac does a very similar thing for iPad, getting you to slay hordes of the undead with touchscreen-typing skills alone.iPadIt's Showtime! (Free)A great app for soul and jazz buffs or casual fans alike, this app serves up one-hour radio-style shows focusing on individual record labels, from Stax, Motown and Atlantic through to Prestige, Blue Note and Pablo, with DJs picking out choice tracks to stream to an iPhone.iPhoneAudioBox (Free)AudioBox offers a new take on cloud music, since it doesn't lock you into one particular service. Instead, it streams music tracks from Dropbox, SkyDrive, Google Drive, YouTube, SoundCloud and its own service – wherever you've chosen to store them.iPhoneGo There Square: A Stella and Sam Adventure (Free)My two young sons spent a decent chunk of 2012 obsessed with Zinc Roe's Stella and Sam apps, which are based on a TV show and picture-book series. They used to be iPad-only, but have now been released in native iPhone / iPod touch versions. Go There Square is a good (free) introduction to the series, blending animation, mini-games and a choice of English or French-language voice narration. The other apps can befound here.iPhone / iPadSeesaw for iPhone (Free)In 2012, an app calledLoveThispromised "recommendations with friends" – a quick way to get tips from friends on a range of subjects. Now Seesaw for iPhone does a similar thing, albeit more through push-polls where you ask friends for opinions, sending photos to illustrate it. The app works over Twitter and Facebook, or via text message for more privacy.iPhoneThe Tallow Candle - by Timbuktu (£1.49)Developer Timbuktu Labs has been making some stylish story-apps for children, with The Tallow Candle its latest release. It's based on a long-lost story by Danish fairytale-teller Hans Christian Andersen that was found in 2012, with light interactivity and lots of illustrations.iPhone / iPadYoung Driver (Free)This UK-focused app comes from The Co-operative Insurance, and is aimed at young drivers. You may have guessed that from the name, of course. It runs on their iPhone and rates their driving from 1-5, with the aim of showing them whether they're eligible for the company's Young Driver insurance policy.iPhoneRoar Rampage (£0.69)There are probably some bad games based on giant dinosaurs punching buildings into dust, but I've yet to find one. Roar Rampage takes its cues from classic arcade-game Rampage, but updates it for 2013 with more weapons, power-ups and boss fights, not to mention in-app purchases.iPhone / iPadSylenth1: Synth Focus (£1.99)This iOS app is the work of publisher Future's Computer Music magazine – the first in a series of apps promising to explore the latest software synthesizers. Expect video tutorials, a developer interview and tips from the professional musicians who use the Sylenth1 synth.iPhone / iPadProCutX for Final Cut Pro X (£17.49)Another app for professional creatives, albeit this time video editors rather than musicians. ProCutX runs on an iPad and controls the Final Cut Pro X software on the user's Mac, offering an elegant touchscreen interface for key features.iPadMetal Slug 2 (£2.49)One for retro-gaming fans this: the second Metal Slug game from SNK Playmore, brought up to date for iOS devices in 2013. New features include a mission mode to choose which level to play, and controls reworked to be less fiddly on a touchscreen.iPhone / iPadSong for my Valentine (£0.69)Consider me your shield from the hundreds of tacky tie-in Valentine's apps released (not to mention press-released) so far in February. This one's fun though: a karaoke app from PureSolo that gets people to sing along to Barry White's You're The First, The Last, My Everything then email the hopefully-tuneful results (with backing track) to their loved one.iPhoneGoodBoy (£0.69)Okay, one more romance-themed app, this time very much tongue-in-cheek. It's "a relationship app for adults" based around men earning and losing "GoodBucks" for their behaviour. Tasks include "Quiche for lunch", "dinner with the in-laws" and "holding hands in public", with rewards including "burping pass" and "bowling and beer".iPhoneThat's this week's selection, but what do you think?

A quick burst of 12 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamDisruptions: Apple is said to be developing a curved-glass smart watch &gt;&gt; NYTimes.comIn its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., Apple is experimenting with wristwatch-like devices made of curved glass, according to people familiar with the company's explorations, who spoke on the condition that they not be named because they are not allowed to publicly discuss unreleased products. Such a watch would operate Apple's iOS platform, two people said, and stand apart from competitors based on the company's understanding of how such glass can curvearound the human body.Wearables are the next step.12 really good reasons to jailbreak iOS 6 right now &gt;&gt; ReadWriteThe only one that really looks compelling is to be able to set a different default app for email, browsing or maps. But for the overwhelming majority of people that isn't an issue that troubles them. Some of the "really good reasons" simply don't apply outside the US - such as data tethering, which is standard on UK contracts; others already exist (security, remote wipe) or are of questionable legality (console emulations).ActiveSync problems with iOS6 &gt;&gt; Tony Redmond's Exchange Unwashed BlogOnline forums have many reports about ActiveSync problems encountered by Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 users after upgrading their Apple devices to iOS6. One issue is when a user apparently "hijacks" a meeting by being made its organizer after they open a meeting request,sometimes associated with delegate accessto the organizer's mailbox.A related issuemight be when a user edits a meeting on their device only to send a cancellation message to all involved, even when the meeting request isn't sent by a delegate.Some reports indicate a connection with devices that synchronize with the Apple iCloud, others say that this isn't a factor. What's confusing the issue is that, aside from working with meeting requests on an iOS6 device (and potentially only devices that have been upgraded to iOS6 rather than coming fresh from the factory with iOS6 preinstalled), there doesn't seem to be great commonality across the reported concerns.iOS 6 is looking a bit buggy, generally.Asustek, Gigabyte together share over 50% of own-brand motherboard market in 2012 &gt;&gt; DigitimesAsustek Computer and Gigabyte Technology shipped 22m and 19m motherboards respectively for own-brand sale in the global DIY market in 2012, together occupying 51.3% of the total global shipments of 80m units, according to Taiwan-based motherboard makers.ASRock and Micro-Star International (MSI) shipped 7.7 million and five million own-brand motherboards respectively in 2012, the sources indicated.There were an estimated 28 million own-brand motherboards shipped in the China DIY market in 2012, accounting for 35% of the global total, the sources noted.It's not clear whether these would be for OEMs who then make up PCs for retail sale, or enthusiasts building their own machines.

The number of enterprises in which IT manages the mobility budget has dropped from 53 to 48%, while it is now managed by business units in 22% of companies, and by finance in 18% of firms....o In 2012, Apple's iPhone passed Research in Motion's (RIM's) BlackBerry to become the most popular smartphone in terms of corporate IT support. BlackBerry is still entrenched in the enterprise but it seems that it is being phased out.o IT is more bullish on Microsoft's Windows Phone 8 handsets than on RIM's BlackBerry 10 phones. Both device lines are new and designed to appeal to the enterprise, as well as to consumers. However, only 34% of IT managers plan to support BlackBerry 10, compared to 45% who plan to support Windows Phone 8 devices going forward.Tablet adoption is growing increasingly mainstream within the enterprise. Between 2011 and 2012, tablet usage increased in all nonexecutive departments, especially legal, HR/ administration and finance/accounting. The iPad is the top choice, with support from 73% of companies.Surface Pro "sells out" &gt;&gt; Virtual PantsWhen new products sell out on launch day it usually means one of two things: it's a hot product or they didn't make enough. Unfortunately for Microsoft, it appears that the Surface Pro falls into the latter category. My local (Northern Virginia) Microsoft store sold out in 15 minutes, which means there wasn't much to sell. The local Best Buy sold out too, but only received one unit. The local Staples received and sold a whopping two units. Selling out on launch day doesn't mean very much when there isn't anything to sell in the first place.Awaiting Microsoft's numbers on this.

If it does, now's a good time to turn it off.The protocol, abbreviated UPnP, lets computers, printers, and other devices make themselves easily discoverable to a network router. But new research by the security firm Rapid7 shows that it could also let hackers easily discover and exploit those routers, too. And the problem is "universal," indeed: A wide-ranging scan of the Internet show that it affects as many as 50 million unique devices.Rapid7 has released ascanning tool(Windows only, so far) to let you find out whether your devices are vulnerable.Adobe issues emergency Flash update for attacks on Windows, Mac users &gt;&gt; Ars TechnicaWould we be better off without it?Bang With NobodyAfter "Bang With Friends" (on Facebook) and "Bang with Professionals" (on LinkedIn), here's the one for Google+:Bang With Nobody: Anonymously find Google+ friends who are down for the night.

Before play even begins, offbeat action platformerSumionimakes an impact based on its striking art style alone. Inspired by Japanesesumi-e, or ink wash, the game presents a world of unique visuals steeped in rich mythology. It's not the first game to adopt the technique –Okamiand the lesser knownOdin Sphereboth employedsumi-eto various extents – but it's used to particularly grand effect here.Although the plot is a generic quest for vengeance to unseat a despotic powermonger, whereSumionishines is in making especially good use of the Vita's touchscreen functions. Guiding the ink demon Agura through 2D levels and slicing down enemies can be done with the physical buttons, but feels clunky. The core mechanic is, instead, to draw on the screen to modify the surroundings, use magic or summon powerful beasts. Once into the flow, swishing bridges over obstacles or setting fortresses on fire while dodging attacks becomes instinctive. A cadence to battle develops, jumping and painting almost in time with the music – it's all rather zen, appropriately so.Stages are sometimes too short, though, and the challenge between them varies wildly. Throughout,Sumioni's greatest strength remains its good looks, but it's so good-looking, that's almost enough.
The communications theorist Marshall McLuhan observed that "we look at the present through a rear-view mirror". And that "we march backwards into the future". Amen. Remember the horseless carriage? Not to mention the fact that we still measure the oomph of a Porsche 911 in, er,brake horsepower.But the car industry is a ferment of modernism compared with the computer business. When the bitmapped screen and theWimp (windows, icons, menus, pointer) interfacefirst surfaced in the early 1970s at Xerox Parc, its geeks searched for a metaphor that would make this new way of relating to computers intelligible to human beings. So they came up with the "desktop" on which were displayed little images (icons) of documents and document folders, just like you'd find on an actual desktop. Well, on the desktop of an efficient bureaucrat anyway.But then they ruined everything by putting a trash can on the desktop. And Bill Gates &amp; Co compounded the offence when they released Windows 95, which also had a start button on the desktop. The result was that, for a time, when most of the world's computer users wanted to switch off their machines they had topress start. Even the car industry thought that was weird.The problem with metaphors is that they are double-edged swords (as it were). On the one hand, we need them because they help us make sense of the new, which is where the horseless carriage, "coachbuilt" limousines etc came from. Metaphors"carry explanatory structures from a familiar domain of experiences into an other domain in need of understanding or restructuring",as the theorist Klaus Krippendorff has written.But at the same time as they help us make sense of something, metaphors also constrain our thinking by locking us into the past. When the web first appeared in 1991, for example, the obvious metaphor was that of a global library – a vast treasure house of digital artefacts held in repositories (sites) that could be accessed by anybody.And the metaphor for a web page was, just that: a page – a static object that could be accessed by a distant reader. But in fact the time when web pages were static objects has long gone. Most web pages nowadays are generated on the fly by servers pulling stuff from their databases and dispatching it across the net for assembly by the recipient's web browser. And a webmail page is in effect a virtual computer (powered byJavaScript) in which you do your email.So although the web has changed out of all recognition in two decades, our underlying metaphor for it probably hasn't changed that much. And this has the downside that we're effectively blind to what is actually happening, which is that we are moving from a world of sites and visits to one that is increasingly dominated bystreams. The guy who articulates this best is a Yale computer scientist namedDavid Gelernter.The title of his latest essay on the subject –"The End of the Web, Search, and Computer as We Know It"– conveys the basic idea. "The space-based web we currently have will gradually be replaced by a time-based worldstream," he writes. "This lifestream — a heterogeneous, content-searchable, real-time messaging stream — arrived in the form of blog posts and RSS feeds, Twitter and other chatstreams and Facebook walls and timelines. Its structure represented a shift beyond the 'flatland known as the desktop' (where our interfaces ignored the temporal dimension) towards streams, which flow and can therefore serve as a representation of time."It's a bit like moving from a desktop to a magic diary: picture a diary whose pages turn automatically, tracking your life moment to moment… Until you touch it and then the page-turning stops. The diary becomes a reference book: a complete and searchable guide to your life. Put it down and the pages start turning again."Gelernter thinks that this diary-like structure is supplanting the spatial one as the dominant metaphor for cyberspace and he may well be right. At any rate, he's not the only geek thinking like this. The social media expertDanah Boydhas alsowritten perceptivelyalong the same lines. As a metaphor, it certainly provides a way of making sense of the attractions of Facebook – now dominated by its timeline technology – and of Twitter, especially as seen through a stream-browser such asHootsuite.  So it will do for now, so long as we remember John Locke's warning: that metaphors "must be made use of to illustrate ideas that we already have, not to paint to us those which we yet have not". He wrote that in 1796.
Some games excel visually; with others it's all about how well they play. Unfortunately,Omerta: City of Gangstersstruggles to achieve much in either department. A turn-based tactical RPG in theXCOMtradition, it's difficult from the very outset to understand quite why it has been given a hard-copy release. Bland menus give way to bland city management overviews, which in turn drill down to bland and slightly unwieldy combat missions.At no point does it ever really feel like player agency is affecting events beyond simply allowing them to happen. The inevitable and deeply constrictive rags-to-riches gangland saga is told entirely through text screens telling you what to do, and then offering two or three ways of "doing" it. All of these involve clicking on buildings and assigning hoods to tasks before waiting to be told if you need to shoot people or not. Shoot enough people and it's on to the next text screen.Crucially, it's very difficult to feel like Scarface when building a criminal empire is reduced to such bare-bones gameplay.Omertamight have been a neat mobile game, or even an XBLA/PSN/Steam download. For the full price of a game disk, however, this is an offer you can refuse.
The arrival of this one coincides with my son starting at nursery. I&nbsp;find myself doing my first ever school run in an enormous car, with just one tiny passenger in the back, choking up and blocking up the narrow London streets. What the hell happened? Overnight I've become one of the people I hate most in the world.It's only up the road, too. Why didn't we walk? Well, we could have&nbsp;done – should have done, really – but&nbsp;it's tipping it down with&nbsp;snow, and I just thought it would be good, on the first day, not&nbsp;to show up shivering and blue. The one day of the year I could possibly justify a 4x4, I've got one. May as well use&nbsp;it…Oh. Just one problem: it's not a 4x4. There are all-wheel-drive CX-5s, of course, it's just that this isn't one of them. It may look tough, especially with its huge, 19in alloy&nbsp;wheels, but it's a sheep in wolf's clothing, no more use on a&nbsp;slippery slope than any other front-wheel-drive car.In many ways the CX-5 is an excellent vehicle. You get loads of room and stuff for the price. It might not be beautiful, but it's no more hideous than any of its rivals. It's very well equipped, if a bit drab, inside. And the fuel consumption and emissions figures are excellent for one of these so-called compact SUVs (they're even better, running costs even lower, in the diesel, but that costs a bit more).Even if I'm blocking up the road, I'm not actually polluting it as much as I look like I am. I'm Monbiot dressed as Clarkson. No, not Monbiot, that's not fair, he definitely would have walked, into the blizzard, towing his kids on a sledge, wrapped in recycled seal skins, for miles and miles across the frozen tundra. And not really Clarkson either – he'd want something much grander, and much more powerful.Anyway, I don't really see the point of these two-wheel-drive SUVs. You can't go anywhere in them you can't go in any other car. Nor are they any better in snow and ice. And&nbsp;yet they have all the bad stuff. They're too big, for this country's cities and supermarket car parks (someone hit and cracked my wing mirror while I was parked up – partly my fault, granted, for not folding them away, but partly the car's fault for being too wide). And everyone hates you – for killing the planet, even if you're not (too much). And if they know that you're&nbsp;not killing it too much (which they won't), they'll hate you for taking up too much of the road, on a&nbsp;short school run, with just one small person in the back. I&nbsp;do actually hate myself right now.Mazda CX-5 2.0 Sport Nav (165ps) 2WDPrice£24,175Top speed124mphAcceleration0-60mph in 9 secondsAverage fuel consumption47.1mpgCO2emissions130g/kmGreen rating5/10Cool rating4/10
A slew of rumours about Sony's upcomingPlayStation 4announcement paint a fascinating picture of what the next generation might look like. Very slightly more powerful than the leaked specification for Microsoft's successor to Xbox 360, the new PlayStation will have a redesigned controller with built-in touchpad and a 'share' functionality that automatically records your last 15 minutes of gameplay, ready to be edited and paraded in front of friends and followers online. A common whinge from developers was that PlayStation 3 was awkward to programme for. With that in mind, Sony's new console will have far more in common with PC architecture. The bad news for British gamers is that it's unlikely to appear in this country until 2014. Sony's press conference, scheduled for 20 Feb, is sure to have plenty more juicy details.

Click here to viewTo solve puzzles in Scribblenauts you type in any noun you can think of to magic an item into existence, from bisque to electrocardiograms to aircraft carrier. You can also prefix nouns with adjectives, so if a dinosaur keeps eating you, changing it to a "vegetarian tyrannosaurus rex" renders it a threat only to shrubbery. As before, you control the hero, Maxwell, but this time you can also unlock various members of his extended family by helping them through whatever amusingly constructed scenario they happen to be facing. Using a more open-world structure than previous outings, you're free to go anywhere you want in search of starites, the game's effective currency, but the freedom is tempered by puzzles that are more to do with guessing what the game is thinking than the manic open-ended invention of the original. It works well, though, as does its reduced reliance on actually controlling Maxwell.
Reading this on mobile? Click here to viewFor the majority of Black Ops II fans, the single-player campaign's eight-ish hours of special forces hijinks are a fleeting distraction before getting down to the long-term business of gunning down strangers online. New downloadable content, Revolution, gives you four extra maps in which to exact random vengeance. Hydro is set at a Pakistani dam; Mirage in a destroyed hotel in the Gobi Desert; Downhill at an Alpine ski resort; and Grind in a Venice Beach skatepark. Each has distinctive terrain features that influence the way you play, from Hydro's occasional watery deluge to Grind's unusually rounded, sloping environments, although none changes the game's trademark tactics-free intensity. You also get Die Rise, a new skyscraper-based zombie survival map, and the Peacemaker, a decent submachine gun that does nothing to unbalance the game. So while it's called Revolution, it's actually anything but.
Google chairman Eric Schmidt is planning to sell 42% of his stake in the search company over the coming year, worth about $2.5bn (£1.6bn), the company announced on Friday.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Google disclosed Schmidt will sell 3.2m shares. Google shares closed at $785.37 on Friday.The plan would give Schmidt "individual asset diversification and liquidity", according to Google's filing with the SEC. The sale will be spread out over the year in order not to affect the company's share price.Last year, Forbes magazine estimated Schmidt's net worth at $7.5bn. A long-term technology executive who has worked at Bell Labs, Xerox and Sun Microsystems, he generated most of his wealth at Google.Schmidt stepped down as Google's chief executive in April 2011 after 10 years at the helm, to be replaced by company co-founder Larry Page. He owns about 7.6 million shares in the company, representing 2.3% of Google's outstanding stock.Since stepping back from the day-to-day running of Google, Schmidt has become increasingly involved in politics. He was a major donor to Barack Obama's re-election campaign and had been considered a potential commerce secretary or chief technology officer.The Google boss hit the headlines last week when it was revealed he had co-authored a book criticising the Chinese authorities. Google has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over censorship and alleged hacking.Schmidt called China the world's "most sophisticated and prolific" hacker of foreign companies, in a book called The New Digital Age, which will be published in April.The book, co-written with Jared Cohen, a former state department official who now runs a Google thinktank, brands China as the world's most dangerous superpower.
Vodafone is warning UK customers with iPhone 4S handsetsnot to update to iOS 6.1.The software update from Applewent out at the end of January, but Vodafone appears to have had customers reporting difficulty.In its statement, Vodafone says "Some customers may occasionally experience difficulty in connecting to the network to make or receive calls or texts or to connect to the Internet. Apple is working on a solution to their software issue. These connection problems are intermittent."It says that the bug affects 3G performance.Other users on different networks have not reported any problems.Michelle Murhead, based in Glasgow,tweetedascreenshot of the warning.Vodafone UK is referring customers to the statement. Apple hadn't responded to a request for comment by publication.Update: users on Three's network in Austria are being given the same advice if they have a 4S handset.Here's the original statement, repeated by a user on Facebook; the Google translation reads: "Dear 3 customer! The update of the iPhone 4S on iOS 6.1 can currently cause connectivity problems. We responded quickly and are working with Apple on a solution to the problem. For this reason, we recommend not to install the update for the time being. We will inform you immediately if there is a solution. Your 3 ServiceTeam."
AOL reported its first annual rise in revenues in eight years on Friday as strong advertising sales underlined the fallen internet star's recovery.Total revenues rose 4% in the fourth quarter to $599.5m, beating analysts' expectations. The company has been buying back stock and pledged to buy another $100m. AOL's shares soared over 9% in early trading.Advertising revenue rose 13% to $410.6m. But the company still makes most of its money from dial-up internet subscriptions, a fading business that still added $158.7m in revenues after accounting adjustments. AOL's two main ad businesses generated $15.2m after adjustments."AOL returned to growth and generated significant value for shareholders in 2012," said Tim Armstrong, chairman and CEO. "AOL has strong momentum entering 2013 and is positioned to continue on our growth path by executing our strategy to build the next generation media and technology company."The ad growth was driven by a 37% rise in revenues for AOL Networks, which sells advertising on behalf of publishers. Revenues at AOL Brands, which includes the Huffington Post, TechCrunch and Patch, a local news network, rose 4%.The brands division was dragged down by a poor performance from Patch. Armstrong had predicted that the network's 900 sites would make between $40m-$50m in 2012 but the total was $34m.On a call with analysts, Armstrong said Hurricane Sandy had affected the local news network. "Sandy essentially followed the path of the Patch rollouts," he said.AOL continued to lose customers at its membership dial-up internet business. Subscription revenues fell 10% as the company reported a 15% drop in subscribers year-over-year.AOL shares are up more than 16% so far this year and over 89% year to date. Last year Armstrong, a former Google ad executive, successfully defended his strategy to turn the company around against activist shareholder Starboard Value. He also sold $1bn of patents to Microsoft, returning the money to shareholders.
Apple's next big thing will be a "smart watch" which will "fill a gaping hole in the Apple ecosystem" – at least according to one of the company's earliest employees, interface expert Bruce Tognazzini.Dubbing the product the "iWatch", Tognazzini says that the product – which he thinks would link to an iPhone via Bluetooth – is probably already being worked on inside Apple.With the companybeing sued by Greenlight Capitalfor hoarding its cash, and with no radically new product since the iPad in January 2010, some are looking to Apple to come up with a blockbuster product that will kindle a new source of revenue as its iPod line – which kicked off its rise in 2001 – begins to fade.And the market for such "wearable computing" is poised to take off, according to Juniper Research, which forecast last November that itcould be worth $1.5bn next yearas consumers, fitness fanatics, healthcare and the military begin to adopt it. But if Apple enters it, the market could explode.Tognazzini, who helped develop the graphical interface used on the first Macintosh, admits his insights into it do not come from insider information – but points out he has "a solid understanding of Apple, its products, the problem and the opportunity".He predicts that it will use wireless charging, have a curved screen – following an Apple patent for the system – and be controlled by the voice-driven assistant Siri. And its essential feature – the "killer app" – will be that it will unlock the screen on the phone when it is brought close, and be able to make the phone ring and light up when the owner is trying to find it."Apple can create a smartwatch with revolutionary functionality that is drop-dead gorgeous. Is there any doubt they will do so?" he asks.Launching such a product would pitch Apple into the market for wearable computing and up against Google, which is planning to introduce its Google Glass system – a pair of clear spectacles with a small screen and camera mounted at the top of the right lens – within months.But it would also be another setback for Microsoft, which – as with tablets – was one of the first companies into the "wearable" market, but has ceded it to rivals. Bill Gates showed off one of the first "smart watches" with theSpot watch in 2004, with a subscription-based model to show data updates. But few people bought them, and Microsoft stopped selling it in 2008, and the services to the watches were turned off in January 2012.Since then the huge focus on smartphones has meant that "wearable" devices have been mostly ignored. But the announcement by Google of its Glass project in May 2012, and the independent Pebble project – which attracted millions of dollars through the KickStarter funding system from individuals in mid-2012, and has now begun shipping to users – points to growing excitement about the potential market.Apple declined to comment on whether it is working on a smart watch.Benedict Evans, tech and telecoms analyst for Enders Analysis, said he was sceptical about the idea. "It seems like exactly the sort of dilution of focus that Apple have always tried to avoid. It would also be expensive – $100 or more, surely – when the main strategic imperative is to expand price points and distribution." He wonder if "it make more sense to expose more capabilities through Bluetooth and expand the third-party hardware accessory market?"But Apple may see a potential replacement for its dwindling iPod business. To replace that, the iWatch would have to generate more than a billion dollars per quarter on average. In the three months over Christmas, Apple sold 12.6m iPods, generating $2.14bn, a fall of 18% in volume, at an average price of $169.But as a controller accessory to an iPhone, an iWatch would be able to attract buyers who already have iPhones and iPads – who number more than 300m, according to Apple's own data. That could drive a huge spurt of sales to early adopters. Tognazzini suggests that an iWatch would handle music – as the Pebble already does. To generate a billion dollars in revenue would require selling 10m at $100 each in a quarter – or fewer, if the device had a higher price tag.Tognazzini forecasts that the iWatch will use wireless charging – which would work even if the watch was still on your wrist, and several feet from the charger. "Apple holds such a patent," Tognazzini notes. "[Remote charging] is not efficient, but if the watch doesn't require all that much power to begin with and will shut down the charger when it is full… [it] will not cost much money". He suggests that AAA or similar batteries are too bulky and expensive to do the job: "You would have to spend $25 to $50 on AAA cells to equal a penny's worth of the power you get out of the wall."He also points to a patent for a low-cost method for making curved glass for screens – another requirement for a watch.He predicts too that it won't necessarily require any touch functionality – and instead will use Apple's voice-drive organiser Siri, connected to the owner's iPhone, to set timers, answer queries, and handle other tasks.The "killer app" for an iWatch, he suggests, would be to deal with the challenge of passcodes on phones (used to lock them): "as long as my iWatch is in range, let me in! That, to me, would be the single most compelling feature a smartwatch could offer: if the watch did nothing but release me from having to enter my passcode/password 10 to 20 times a day, I would buy it. I would buy it even if it didn't tell the right time!"A second killer app would be to find your iPhone – so that making a request (such as "find my phone") would lead to the phone lighting up or ringing. It could also be used for tethering: "By the time you realise you have left your top-secret prototype iPhone sitting on the bar, Gizmodo will have probably already published an article on it. However, with the iWatch on your wrist, as soon as you move out of range, it will tell you that you've forgotten your phone, then help you locate it, as needed."Tognazzini, who helped refine and build some of the earliest interfaces for the Mac OS interface, including elements that are used everywhere – such as cut and paste (and the choice of keyboard shortcuts), has been working as an independent expert offering analysis on user interfaces for more than a decade, working with the Nielsen/Norman Group in the US.He suggests a huge range of potential for an iWatch's other "killer apps": it could be used to answer (or put off) incoming calls, for sensors, and incorporate Near Field Communications (NFC) for payment systems – the latter being an element that a number of industry analysts were disappointed not to see in the iPhone 5 when it was launched in September.If Tognazzini is correct about the project, it would catapult Apple into competition with Google, which is developing its Glass project, and smaller companies such asPebble, which has begun shipping its eponymous smart watch to thousands of people who supported it on Kickstarter around the world.Tognazzini notes that existing smartwatches are "big and clunky" – they need charging, can't be read at night without extra lighting, and have functions that are often surplus to user needs.He points though to recent examples, including theCookoowhich runs for a year between charges, and the Pebble, which is said to last a week between charges – "longer than smart watches used to go, but hardly compares to what people expect in a modern watch".He even sees potential for people to help correct Apple's maps through crowdsourcing: "Using pressure data from millions of watches, Apple could build a precision altitude map of the world. This map would indicate true altitudes everywhere that iWatch wearers travel. The granularity would be several orders of magnitude greater than ever before attempted for a wide-area map at a cost several orders of magnitude less than Flyover."The wearables market is thought to be poised for a takeoff, with Google, Apple and Microsoft all having filed large numbers of patents which relate to devices that can be worn on the head or wrist and provide data about the environment, as well as providing extra information for the user.
There is a lot of existential angst going on at the annualDICE summitin Las Vegas this week. In a city not commonly associated with angst, or indeed existentialism, two veteran game developers have delivered speeches in which they berated the industry for its immaturity and homogeneity.On Wednesday, David Cage, the thoughtful creative director of titles such as Heavy Rain and Fahrenheit, gave a talk entitled "The Peter Pan Syndrome: The Industry That Refused to Grow Up". He criticised developers for concentrating on three genres – kids, casual and violence – and for sticking to essentially one plot: "You're a hero, and you need to kill people in order to go somewhere, free the world, free the princess, or whatever." He said he wanted to see games with meaning, games for a wider audience, games with emotion. You can see the entire thing here:And then yesterday, veteran designer Warren Spector, the creator of Deus Ex, took to the stage. He spoke with his usual eloquence and charm about growing older as a gamer, and about how he was looking for different things, deeper experiences, from interactive entertainment:"I have no interest in guys who wear armour and swing big swords. I have been the last space marine between earth and an alien invasion. I really just don't need to go there anymore. I want content that is relevant to my life, that is relevant to me, that is set in the real world."At one point, in front of a slide showing scenes from Suda 51's explosive brawler, Lollipop Chainsaw, he announced, "there are some games that should just not be made."Both men have drawn ire from the gaming community – the tiresomely predictable reaction to anyone who challenges the status quo in this business. But both are also in precarious positions. Cage's Heavy Rain, while brilliantly suspenseful, interesting and idiosyncratic, was also violent and flawed. Spector's last games, the Epic Mickey titles, have drawn mixed reviews and sales have been disappointing, leading to the closure of his studio, Junction Point. Perhaps if it had been Gabe Newell from Valve up there, worrying about the state of game design, responses may have been slightly less vociferous.So are they right? Well if they are, it's only from a very narrow perspective: the perspective of the mainstream games industry. It's still possible to look at the best-selling retail games of the year and see only titles aimed at young, predominantly male audiences; you'll find the odd dancing game, a smattering of Marios, but mostly it will be soldiers and assassins, saving humanity or themselves.But then of course, taking this list as your reference group is like glancing at the top ten movie blockbusters and declaring that all films are noisy, idiotic and soulless. And no one in Hollywood bothers to stand up in front of their peers and say, "you know, perhaps we shouldn't let Michael Bay make any more movies".Look around, look just a teeny bit deeper, and you see a more appealing truth: that video gameshavematured, they've grown, they're taking on wider themes and ideas. Look at Thirty Flights of Loving or The Stanley Parable; look at Papo &amp; Yo or Dys4ia... or if you don't want to credit the indie community with all that is interesting and unconventional in gaming, look at Portal or The Sims, or even Walking Dead, which has violence but is really about hope, despair and fading humanity. Indeed, it is enormously telling that, between these two keynotes, DICE held its annual awards ceremony, during which the biggest winner was Journey, a mystical adventure about self-discovery and death. Thatgamecompany's experimental marvel was victorious in eight categories; it has also proved commercially successful. This is happening right now.Spector concedes that his thinking on games has changed, and that he enjoyed the transgressive gore of mainstream games in his youth. This is important, because most of those mainstream games are made by young people – or more accurately young men. This is still a young industry. But as the business matures it is the responsibility of designers like Cage and Spector – who are, let's say, rather older than average – to create games that appeal to their peers.I'm older too – but for all its flaws and problematic obsessions, I wouldn't begrudge anyone the chance of playing Lollipop Chainsaw, or any of those really great games that have soldiers and assassins and space ships. Saving the world is fun – it is a central motif of story telling as far back as stories go.What the industry needs is not less of all that stuff, maybe, but more of what the film industry has. It needs more Michael Hanekes or Pedro Almodóvars or Coen brothers. It needs less industry elders pointing out what's wrong and more doing their own thing to provide an alternative.

Should I really remove Java from all my Windows 7 machines running MSE and Chrome?Richard(viaTwitter)I think everyone should uninstall Java from all their PCs and Macs, and then think carefully about whether they need to add it back. If you are a typical home user, you can probably do without it. If you are a business user, you may not have a choice. Many companies have used the Java language to develop business applications that run on servers, and this "server-side" Java is safe. It's the "client-side" Java running via web browser plug-ins that is not safe.Note that Java has nothing to do with JavaScript, which is another language used to develop websites and apps. JavaScript was originally developed by a different company (Netscape) under a different name (LiveScript). The name was changed for marketing reasons that disgraced both the companies involved, neither of which survived.Java has been in the news this year because of some "zero day" vulnerabilities exploited by malware writers. (Zero daymeans there is no patch for the hole, so users cannot protect themselves by updating their software.) This also happened last August, and The Register published a story sayingDisable Java NOW, users told, as 0-day exploit hits web.In fact, Java became the main vehicle for malware attacks in the third quarter of 2010, when they increased 14-fold, according to Microsoft's Security Intelligence Report Volume 10(PDF). Things got worse, and Kaspersky, a leading anti-virus company, dubbed 2012The year of Java vulnerabilities. It said: "Java security holes were responsible for 50% of attacks. Windows components and Internet Explorer were only exploited in 3% of incidents." Yes, it's that bad.I therefore regard Java as an unnecessary security risk, and I removed it from our home PCs years ago. There were a few things I could no longer run, such as KeepVid for downloading YouTube videos and some ASDL speed tests, so I had to find alternatives. I suggest you do the same. Living without Java is much less of a challenge than living without Adobe Flash.All programs have bugs and may have security holes, so why the Draconian approach? Sorry to say, I don't have enough confidence in Oracle's ability to fix it. Oracle didn't write Java, just inherited it when it bought the failing Sun Microsystems, and according toThe Register: "Metasploitfounder HD Moore warned Oracle was still sitting on a backlog of Java flaws that will take up to two years to patch, even without the discovery of new flaws."Oracle is good at selling high-priced products to large enterprises, but Java involves dealing with up to a billion non-paying consumers. In my view, Oracle'sbelated responseto the recent "veritable media firestorm" does not make the right noises about protecting consumers. It seems more concerned with defending its profit-making server-side and embedded Java businesses.So, start by disabling Java in all your browsers. In Internet Explorer 8, for example, select Tools and then Manage Add-ons, and in Google Chrome, type chrome://plugins in the address bar. Sophos'sNaked Securityblog has instructions for most popular browsers.I also recommend uninstalling any other versions of Java that you can find via the Windows Control Panel. You may find three or four: in my experience, old versions of Java are not always removed. After that, run the freeCCleanerprogram to clear out any bits left behind. (If you don't have CCleaner, download it from piriform.com, not some scam site or a Google ad.)Next, go to thejava.comwebsite and click the link that says "Do I have Java?" The answer should be no.Re-installing JavaIf you know you must have Java installed, you can now do a clean installation of the latest version, either Java 6 to Update 39, or Java 7 Update 13. Java 6 is on the way out and won't be updated again. Some companies have stuck with it, possibly because of Java 7's terrible security reputation, but it has most of the same vulnerabilities. Mac users must update to the Java 7 Update 13 for Mac OS X.If you are not sure you need Java, try running your PC for a few weeks to see if you can do without it. You will get a notification from any website that needs a Java browser plug-in. However, you must install it from java.com, becausesome malware pretends to be Java update 11.Only install Java in a single web browser, and use this browser only for Java sites. For example, if you normally browse the web with IE or Chrome, install the Java plug-in in Firefox or Opera, or vice versa. Java is being attacked, and restricting it to one browser minimises the "attack surface".Also, whenever you install or update Java, do it carefully. Oracle may try to install other software that you definitely do not want, such as the Ask toolbar. ZDNet's Ed Bott and Harvard Business School's Ben Edelman have analysed the problem inA close look at how Oracle installs deceptive software with Java updates. Don't get caught.Java on MacsJava is a cross-platform system, so the same vulnerabilities may be present on other operating systems besides Windows. Apple users have also suffered. In 2010, for example, there was aMac OS X version of the Koobface worm. Last year's Mac Flashback Trojan led to more than600,000 infected Macs being added to a botnet, including 274 in Apple's home town, Cupertino.Apple stopped including Java by default in OS X 10.7 (Lion), and has just used its XProtect software to block current versions of Java until they were patched. In effect, it treated Java as malware. This protected customers, but not everyone was pleased. After MacWorld UK reported the story (Apple bans Java from Macs, businesses that rely on Java bereft), editor Karen Haslam quipped onTwitter: "Unfortunately we're one of the businesses affected... perhaps Apple doesn't want us to go to press!"InfoWorld magazine complained thatApple's Java sabotage is bad IT business. Since Apple is a consumer electronics company, I don't expect it's too bothered about corporate IT.Extra precautionsI think everybody should be free to run whatever operating system and applications they like. However, you should be aware that running Java in the browser brings extra risk, and therefore you should take extra precautions.(1) Always run the latest version of Java and make sure you install all the patches. At the moment, this may mean checking for updates every week, or even every day. You can do this with Secunia'sPersonal Software Inspector. (I wouldn't trust Java's built-in updater.)(2) Run extra checks for malware using a different anti-virus product from the one you already have installed, especially if it's MSE (Microsoft Security Essentials). Two good free standalone checkers areMalwarebytes AntiMalwareandKaspersky Security Scan.(3) Make daily backups, and keep aclone of your hard drive. PCs are cheap but data may be irreplaceable.
It's time for our weekly roundup of new and notable Android apps, based on what's been released for the first time on the Google Play store in the last week.As ever, the selection includes apps and games, with the prices quoted referring to the initial download only: games in particular often use in-app purchases, even if they're free to download.Read on for this week's roundup:Aralon: Sword and Shadow (£3.17)Good news for Android owners itching to get stuck in to a sprawling RPG adventure. Aralon: Sword and Shadow is the work of Crescent Moon games, with a huge open world to explore, lots of quests and side-quests to occupy your time, and more monsters than you can shake a (sharpened) stick at.4oD (Free)Channel 4 has ported its 4oD TV on-demand app to Android, providing a selection of its shows (plus those from E4 and More4) to stream over a Wi-Fi connection in the UK. The broadcaster promises a 30-day catch-up window for programmes, although there's no offline caching, nor will the app work on rooted devices.Carbon for Twitter (Free)"Simple, Dark, and a dash of elegance for your Twitter day-to-day pleasure," promises Carbon for Twitter's Google Play listing. It's a Twitter client that's already causing plenty of excitement, with a stylish design promising less taps to navigate around your stream.Wunderlist 2 (Free)Excellent to-do list app Wunderlist 2 has been out for Android smartphones for a while, but now it has a native tablet version too. It's good for building all manner of lists, with reminders, notifications and social features thrown in for good measure.The Simpsons: Tapped Out (Free)Americans: this one's for you. I'm told that EA's free-to-play Simpsons game will be available to Android owners elsewhere in the world later this month though. For now, the US-only port of the popular iOS game sees you rebuilding Springfield, fuelled by the in-game donuts currency.The Little Mermaid (£2.99)Developer StoryToys has made a name for itself with cute digital pop-up books based on various Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Now it's turning its attention to Hans Christian Andersen and The Little Mermaid, with a mixture of pop-up scenes, mini-games and easily-readable text.Life is Magic (Free)Once upon a time, location-based gaming meant 24 Swedish men running around a field pretending to shoot one another with text messages. Nowadays, things have moved on a bit. Life is Magic is  a massively multiplayer location game set in a fantasy universe, where you explore dungeons, battle monsters and team up with other players – all overlaid on the real world.Tesla Model S Beta (Free)Got a Tesla Model S electric car AND an Android handset? Okay, it's a niche right now, but the official app is interesting for its hints at future connectivity between smartphones and cars. The app lets Tesla Model S owners check charging progress, heat or cool the car before driving it, ping its location and honk its horn when trying to find it, and lock or unlock it.Fox Now (Free)Another US-only app – this column gets plenty of American readers, if you're wondering why I cover them – this is from broadcaster Fox. "The mobile destination for your favorite Fox shows," as the Google Play listing puts it. That means trailers and clips, cast interviews, photos and social features for shows including The Simpsons and Raising Hope.Burpple (Free)Those photos your friends are taking: they're not random snaps of lasagne. They're "trusted food moments". Well, they are on Burpple. It's the latest app aiming to help people share snaps of their meals, tagging them with times and places, while cross-posting them to various social networks.Young Driver (Free)This UK-focused app comes from The Co-operative Insurance, and is aimed at young drivers. You may have guessed that from the name, of course. It runs in the background on their Android phone and rates their driving from 1-5, with the aim of showing them whether they're eligible for the company's Young Driver insurance policy.Cartoon Wars: Blade (Free)The title says it all: cartoon graphics, lots of people to make war against, and blades by the dozen. Part of a wider Cartoon Wars series from publisher Gamevil, this is a zippy adventure with characterful graphics and lots of hacking and slashing.Guns 4 Hire (Free)There are LOTS OF CAPITAL LETTERS in the Google Play listing for Rebellion's Guns 4 Hire game, to indicate its EXPLOSIVE gameplay. Said gameplay involves four "ass-kicking, money-hungry mercs" taking on hordes of bad guys in this free-to-play bullet-fest. It looks great fun.Autology Homework Tutor (£2.99)The Kids, of course, shouldn't be having great fun with (virtual) big guns: they should be doing their homework. Autology Homework Tutor wants to help with that. Aimed at 11-19 year-old students in the UK, it aggregates educational content from a range of sources, charging £2.99 a month or £29.99 a year for access.Monster Rivals (Free)Monster Rivals is a social game from developer Pixelmaji that sees players building their own monster then battling those of Facebook friends, working their way through more than 30 weapons to find the best strategy.MoviePass (Free)US-only, but a very intriguing idea: a subscription service that lets its users pay a monthly fee to see as many films as they want in partner cinemas. The app ties in with the existing MoviePass website.Metal Slug 2 (£2.49)One for retro-gaming fans this: the second Metal Slug game from SNK Playmore, brought up to date for Android devices in 2013. New features include a mission mode to choose which level to play, and controls reworked to be less fiddly on a touchscreen.Bakery Story: Valentine's Day (Free)TeamLava's Bakery Story is more for present-day mobile gamers, being a free-to-play social game based around running a virtual bakery. This is a brand new app: a Valentine's Day spin-off. Expect heart-shaped cakes and plenty of pink icing.MyPics (Free)Developer AppStair says more than 850k people have downloaded the iPhone version of this media-organising app. Now it's on Android, helping you to browse the photos and videos stored on your device and its SD card, and organise them into digital albums. Editing and sharing features are also included.Quietto (£0.61)Finally this week, something for anyone presenting at a conference with an Android device to hand (or, rather, in pocket). Described as a "discreet time-control app", Quietto vibrates gently at pre-set times to keep you alerted about your progress.That's our selection, but what do you think? Post your recommendations or views on the apps above in the comments section.
Phew, Friday. What you up to for the weekend then?
A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team'Fragmentation' leaves Android phones vulnerable to hackers, scammers &gt;&gt; The Washington Post"You have potentially millions of Androids making their way into the work space, accessing confidential documents," said Christopher Soghoian, a former Federal Trade Commission technology expert who now works for the American Civil Liberties Union. "It's like a really dry forest, and it's just waiting for a match."Google engineers designed Android to resist hackers and have continually improved it. The company also has worked to purge malicious software from its app store, Google Play, minimizing the risk from one possible route of infection."We've built the system from Day One to deal with this kind of world," said Hiroshi Lockheimer, vice president of Android engineering. "The health of the Android ecosystem is really important to us."Yet while each new generation of Android delivers improvements that close off newly discovered avenues of attack, the company has struggled to get updated software to smartphones already in the hands of consumers.Slow updates + BYOD = problem.US judge rejects 13 Google-Motorola patent claims against Microsoft &gt;&gt; ZDNetA federal judge in Washington state has invalidated more than a dozen patent claims in the case of Microsoft v Motorola.Right now, the winner (of this particular skirmish) is Microsoft over Google-owned Motorola Mobility.On Wednesday, Judge James L. Robart of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, issued an order in favor of Microsoft, invalidating 13 patent claims.Those claims are in reference to just three patents (U.S. Patent No. 7,310,374, U.S. Patent No. 7,310,375, US Patent No. 7,310,376) -- all of which have to do with encoding and decoding digital video content.Microsoft had petitioned that the "means for decoding" and the "means for using" elements of the patents in question be declared as invalid based ona specific US patent law specification, and the court has consented.This relates to H.264, where Motorola has been trying to block Microsoft's use of it in the Xbox 360 unless it pays 2.25% of the retail cost. Microsoft's been resisting. Not going too well for Motorola. Even if it gets the patents reinstated, it will have to license them to Microsoft on FRAND terms.Statement by Apple &gt;&gt; Business WireApple says:By early last year, Apple's cash balance had built to a point beyond what we needed to run our business and maintain flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities, so we announced a plan to return $45 billion to shareholders over three years. As of next week we will have executed $10 billion of that plan.&lt;p: We find ourselves in the fortunate position of continuing to generate large amounts of cash, including $23 billion in cash flow from operations in the last quarter alone.Apple's management team and Board of Directors have been in active discussions about returning additional cash to shareholders. As part of our review, we will thoroughly evaluate Greenlight Capital's current proposal to issue some form of preferred stock. We welcome Greenlight's views and the views of all of our shareholders.Translation: "sod off, Greenlight."Microsoft Office for Linux: Are people asking and answering the wrong question? | Hal's (Im)Perfect VisionHal Berenson:Now do recall that I considered porting SQL Server to *nix at a couple of points. So I have first hand experience with taking this kind of idea to Microsoft's senior leadership, including Steve Ballmer. It is not the knee-jerk negative reaction that outsiders expect. It is a rational encouragement to make the case. Have Steve's views changed in the many years since I talked to him about porting to a non-Windows OS? No doubt. At some points in the intervening years I'm sure he's been less receptive to the discussion. But in his efforts to remake Microsoft into a Devices and Services company I would venture he's become more receptive than ever to such proposals. Services need clients. Services can not be allowed to fail because you refuse to support the clients that users actually use, even if they aren't your clients.You can listen to people guessing, or to Berenson, who has actually been in Ballmer's office. His conclusion:Personally I think everyone translates "Office for x" into full ports of Office for platform x. But I doubt that is in the cards. These other platforms, be that the iPad or Linux, are likely to get subset offerings targeted at the Office 365 service and usage scenarios Microsoft prioritizes.Yandex just passed Bing to become 4th largest global search engine &gt;&gt; Search Engine WatchYandex surpassed Microsoft on the number of monthly search queries worldwide in November and December 2012, according to a recently released comScore qSearch report. Microsoft sites processed 4.477bn queries and Yandex did 4.844bn. As you'd expect, Google still reigned supreme with 114.73bn search queries and a 65.2% market share. China search giant Baidu was second globally with 14.5bn (8.2%), and Yahoo came in third with 8.63bn (4.9%).Russia is big and has lots of internet users. The maps on the page were broken so it's unclear whether Yandex is getting share outside its homeland.EU's underwhelming GPS rival could be axed in new budget cuts &gt;&gt; Ars TechnicaThe European Union is holding budget talks to decide how to spend EUR1 trillion ($1.35 trillion) over the next seven years.While that sentence may not sound exciting, it could mean the beginning of the end of Galileo, Europe's potential competitor to the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the second such rival, behind Russia's GLONASS.Galileo, which is officially known as the European Global Navigation Satellite System, only has four of 30 planned satellites in orbit. While Galileo would serve little strategic interest--as it would largely duplicate GPS--its supporters say that it's important for Europe to have its own such system, largely for political pride reasons.We pointed out in 2006 that Galileo is awaste of time, effort and money.Don't Hold It Wrong &gt;&gt; TumblrDavid Chartier is collecting warnings about holding phones wrong (it interferes with the antenna(e)).

And what does it do? You guessed it right, it cleans the screen of your tablet or phone automatically. The little one has three tires for maneuvering and two made of paper which do the cleaning. The onboard sensors prevent the Automee S from falling off the edges and also lets it clean the entire surface evenly.One way to consumer-spend Japan out of its "lost decade" - currently in its third decade. (Thanks @undersinged for the link.)The rise of bounding asterisks in lieu of italicization for emphasizing text &gt;&gt; Daring FireballWhere by "emphasis" I mean "informing the reader of a shift in voice", such as how foreign words are italicized in many publications and books. Using asterisks this way [such as *cough* or *sigh*] strikes me as an Internet-ism. I would think those coughs should be italicized; using bounding asterisks is a substitute in plain text contexts, something we collectively started doing in email, newsgroups, web comments and forums, and various other input fields where computer software doesn't allow proper italics (or bold, any other formatting).The way that the investigation of the question - is it an internet-ism? - is concluded is really neat, and persuasive.You can followGuardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard.

Hedge fund billionaire David Einhorn is suing Apple to force the company to return more of its $137bn (£87bn) cash pile to shareholders.Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital hedge fund owns 1.3m Apple shares – 0.12% of the company, said the iPhone and iPad maker has a "cash problem" that it should solve by paying out more to investors. He said Apple was an "extraordinary company, [with] extraordinary products and extraordinary prospects" and added that he was "absolutely enthusiastic about the stock"."But we do have a few suggestions as to how to help the shareholders make more money while allowing Apple to pursue all of its plan," he told Bloomberg TV.Einhorn said he understood that Apple  wanted to make sure it had large cash reserves because of the "tough times" it has been through in the past. But he said Apple's cash mountain – which is only £3.7m less than the gross domestic product of New Zealand and 23 times the market value of Marks &amp; Spencer – has grown far too big.The company should reduce its cash by giving away perpetual preferred stock with a 4% yield. Preferred stock are a hybrid of debt and equity that pay a regular dividend but have no voting rights.The hedge fund magnate said he had been discussing his idea with Apple for several months but the company rejected it. Greenlight said Apple had agreed to discuss Einhorn's plan again but only after the hedge fund began legal action against proposed changes to Apple's charter, which Einhorn said: "unnecessarily limit the board's flexibility to distribute preferred stock as a means of unlocking shareholder value".Einhorn wrote an open letter to other Apple shareholders, many of whom have already called on the company to return cash to shareholders, saying: "We understand that many of our fellow shareholders share our frustration with Apple's capital allocation policies. Apple has $145 (£107) per share of cash on its balance sheet. As a shareholder, this is your money."Last year Apple started paying a dividend for the first time since 1995 and committed to buying back $10bn worth of stock over three years. Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's finance director, has said the company "continually" assesses the prospect of returning more cash to shareholders and "we'll do what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders".Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said: "There is a widespread belief that Apple does not need to accumulate more cash and should be more aggressive in returning cash."I believe that Apple should look to take on debt at very low rate and dramatically increase its dividend. Others believe that Apple should return more cash through buybacks. The fact is for a company to have $137bn and to be adding $40bn a year is destroying economic value for shareholders," he told CNBC.Apple's cash is managed by its own hedge fund, Braeburn Capital, from a quiet suburb of Reno, Nevada. Much of Apple's money is trapped overseas, sheltered from the US taxman, who would demand a 35% cut were the money to be repatriated. But it can be invested at home. Apple's financial reports show it holds $21bn of US government debt – a vast sum for a single private investor. Foreign governments like investing in US securities, but Apple owns more than the $19bn held by Malaysia, and only $4bn less than Spain.Apple's largest investment category is corporate securities. It has $44.5bn in company shares, more than the entire $39bn managed by Man Group, Britain's largest hedge fund. It is also a big holder of other nations' debt, with $7bn invested in sovereign securities abroad.Little is known about which companies Apple invests in. It occasionally owns stakes large enough to be declared: Apple was a founding investor in British chip designer ARM, but has sold out, and owns 9% of Hertfordshire-based Imagination Technologies, which designs video and audio chips.Braeburn does not file a record with the American stock market regulator, or the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure register; it is not an independent adviser but a division of a private company.
In its latest attempt to diminish its major rival's brand power, Microsoft released its newest anti-Google campaign on Wednesday, accusing the site of violating its users' email privacy.Microsoft's "Scroogled" campaign –which comes with a new website– aims to boost support for its Outlook email service by criticizing Google's practice of scanning users' emails to create targeted ads.The Gmail practice ensures that when someone exchanges emails with a friend about a low-budget zombie movie they are planning to make, ads for The Walking Dead, survivalist gear and film production jobs might appear in their Gmail sidebar."Outlook.com believes your privacy is not for sale," Stefan Weitz, senior director of Online Services at Microsoft, said in a statement. "We believe people should have choice and control over their private email messages, whether they are sharing banking information or pictures of their family or discussing their medical history."Google has used targeted ads in its mail service since 2004, and has been subject to unsuccessful lawsuits at the state and federal level that allege the targeted ad practice violates illegal eavesdropping or interception laws.Microsoft criticized the targeted ad practice in aGmail Man parody video in 2011and attacked the company's app service in2012 video called Googlighting.While the Scroogled website emphasizes that Microsoft does not scan emails to create targeted ads,it does mention that it scans users' emails."Outlook.com only scans the contents of your email to help protect you and display, categorize, and sort your mail appropriately. Just like the postal service sorts and scans mail and packages for dangerous explosives and biohazards, Outlook.com scans your mail to help prevent spam, gray mail, phishing scams, viruses, malware, and other dangers and annoyances."When Microsoft changed its Hotmail web email service to Outlook.com in summer 2012, the company further explained its email scanning policyto the Wall Street Journal. Instead of targeted advertising, it said it had planned to generate revenue through text ads on Outlook.com, which are related to interests in the subject lines of emails."The ads will only appear in the inbox, the company said, not once an email is opened. Microsoft won't scan email content," said the general manager of the Microsoft group that oversees Hotmail, Brian Hall.The anti-Gmail campaign also includes a petition, videos and Scroogling Facebook page, where people are almost exclusively posting criticisms of Microsoft. "Microsoft is a pathetic company! Improve your services instead of using negative ad campaigns … Maybe then you'll stop fading into obscurity!"said one Facebook user.Microsoft's campaign touts a studyit commissioned that shows that more than 85% of email users disapprove of email service providers scanning email to provide targeted advertisements, think the practice is an invasion of privacy and believe the practice should not be allowed or feature an opt out option.Gmail users who pay $50 per year for the business email service do not receive the targeted ads, but there is no free opt-out Gmail product."Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and services Google offers free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive and relevant," a Google spokesperson said. "No humans read your email or Google Account information in order to show you advertisements or related information. An automated algorithm – similar to that used for features like Priority Inbox or spam filtering – determines which ads are shown."
Microsoft and Symantec have disabled a two-year-old network of remotely controlled PCs, or "botnet", that was responsible for at least a million dollars in "click fraud" every year – and possibly substantially more – and which may have controlled as many 1.8m PCs.The ringleaders are reckoned to be spread globally, in Britain, Russia and Romania, the US and Australia. They used false names and stolen credit details to register a string of domains and hire server space in a number of locations. None has yet been identified formally or arrested.The "Bamital" botnet, set up in late 2009, took over PCs and would silently click on specific adverts in search results – hijacking an average of three million clicks per day, and exposed the PCs' owners to the risk of more infection as they were taken to other sites that could carry further malware.But the researchers point out that it is by no means the largest botnet in operation, which "puts the magnitude of click fraud botnets into perspective. There are millions of computers hijacking legitimate searches as well as generating non-human network traffic. The exact amount of loss being incurred by legitimate organisations is impossible to gauge."But they reckon it is worth millions of dollars to the criminal underground behind the creation and exploitation of such botnets.Click fraud is a serious problem for advertisers and search engines. Bamital exploited both the "pay per click" model, where advertisers are charged by a distribution network for every click on an ad displayed online, and the "search results" model – by diverting any click from a search results page to a fake site offering a counterfeit version of a product the user had sought.The criminals behind the scheme were taking advantage of search advert pricing which could be as small as four-hundredths of a cent - meaning that they had to build up a large botnet that even so remained undetected by infected users, and hijack huge amounts of traffic in order to profit. The process by which clicks were rerouted via "traffic brokers" to paying advertisers was so complex, said Symantec, that in some cases it could go through 10 hops before reaching the actual advertiser.The initial infections of the PCs were carried out via pornography sites and sites promising pictures of celebrities, as well as shopping searches.In awhite paper on the botnet and its effects, Symantec warns that "data shows that Bamital activity peaked in 2011 and early 2012. While the malware remains active today, there are indications that the attackers are reorganising their operations."It also says that "click fraud is a lucrative business in the malware industry", and points out that Bamital is just one of the many pieces of malware used to infected computers for this work.The takedown involved raids on data centres in New Jersey and Virginia, and followed a year of cooperation between Symantec and Microsoft. Last week the companies finally acquired a court order to seize the servers being used for "command and control" of the botnet, although those in charge of the data centres are not thought to be responsible.
The next Xbox console may require a permanent online connection and could rule out the pre-owned games market, Edge magazinehas reported. Staff on the veteran games publication claim to have spoken to developers who have projects underway for both the next Xbox and for PlayStation 4. According to these anonymous sources, the forthcoming Xbox 360 successor will require users to sign into their online account whenever they play, restricting purchased games to this single identity."Microsoft has asked itself what kind of consumer is going to buy its next Xbox and surmised that it's the kind of consumer with a decent internet connection," says Edge online editor, Neil Long. "Like the App Store and Steam, the next Xbox will be download-first, one account, one purchase, one storefront system. It will offer far greater flexibility on pricing, but games players are used to thinking in terms of £40-£50 games in boxes. Microsoft could have a difficult time explaining that games will now be tethered to one account."Clearly, the move toward a digital distribution service, where gamers can opt between different payment models, including subscription services, is the future. The retail games market is falling, with consumers becoming less and less inclined to spend £50 on a game release, especially when they can get smartphone titles for £1 – or even for free. We're already seeing console titles toying with 'in-app purchase' models where gamers are charged for pieces of equipment or extra content. Released this week, the sci-fi shooter Dead Space 3 allows players to complete micro transactions to buy new weapons. However, according to Eurogamer, fans have alreadydiscovered a glitchthat allows them to bypass the payment system.Both Microsoft and Sony have been studying subscription services from other media sectors such as Spotify, iTunes and Netflix. Sony has developed its PlayStation Plus subscription service which offers free and discounted games in return for monthly payments. And last summer, Microsoft ran a trial in its own US stores, offering an Xbox 360 console to consumers at just $99 – if they took up a two-year subscription to the Xbox Live Gold service.The plan will meet with considerable resistance from gamers and retailers however. Previous attempts to restrict games via aggressive DRM strategies have generated both controversy and technical difficulties, with major publisher Ubisoft abandoning its own compulsory 'always online' system last September. The pre-owned games market also represents a major source of revenue for embattled chains such as Game and HMV, which receive very small margins on the sale of new titles but get 100% of the revenue from second-hand sales.Official Xbox Magazine editor, Jon Hicks has writtenan editorialrefuting Edge's claims and pointing out the problems of an "always on" system, including the fact that in many territories, broadband access is far from universal."It is true that publishers and consoles platform manufacturers, which derive revenue from license charges per disc, are looking for ways to derive more value from pre-owned games sales," says Piers Harding-Rolls, a senior analyst at IHS Screen Digest. "However, we do not expect Microsoft to pursue this with a blanket DRM strategy on physical discs to enable only one owner per disc on its next generation device."Harding-Rolls, like Hicks, suggests that its more likely Microsoft will end up adopting a system like EA's Online Pass, which requires online activation for multiplayer components – so you'll be able to buy games second-hand, but will need to pay to play against other people on the web. "The online activation of games is contentious," says Harding-Rolls. "20% to 30% of all Xbox 360s have never been connected to the internet and internet services vary in availability and quality from country to country. While a vast majority of early next generation Xbox adopters are likely to be connected, we do not believe the concept of compulsory online activation of games will resonate strongly with consumers in general."Edge also reports that it has had confirmation of the next Xbox console's tech specs: "an AMD eight-core x64 1.6GHz CPU, a D3D11.x 800MHz graphics solution and 8GB of DDR3 RAM." The article also suggests that PlayStation 4 will have technological advantages as well as a preferable development environment:Though the architectures of the next-gen Xbox and PlayStation both resemble that of PCs, several development sources have told us that Sony's solution is preferable when it comes to leveraging power. Studios working with the next-gen Xbox are currently being forced to work with only approved development libraries, while Sony is encouraging coders to get closer to the metal of its box. Furthermore, the operating system overhead of Microsoft's next console is more oppressive than Sony's equivalent, giving the PlayStation-badged unit another advantage.Sony is likely to announce its forthcoming PlayStation 4 console at a major press event in New York on 20 February. After falling behind in this console generation, delaying the release of PS3 due to manufacturing difficulties, the company is looking to win back its dominance of the home console sector. Certainly, Nintendo looks to have fallen behind with its Wii U, which has failed to generate as much demand as the original Wii.With the PR war now on, Microsoft is yet to reveal anything about its console, or any DRM plans – the company is expected to make its own announcements at the E3 exhibition in June. What it won't want is months of speculation about a radical and potentially unpopular game buying system."Microsoft must be confident that its next Xbox tech is lean and user-friendly," says Long. "It's a bold move, certainly [...] Microsoft could have a difficult time explaining that games will now be tethered to one account. We also understand that PS4 won't have such restrictions. It looks like an easy PR win for Sony ... unless the strength of the reaction online forces Microsoft to reconsider."
It's the seventeenth century. The  bubonic plague has spread across Europe and the last survivors huddle together in fear for their lives and for the future of the human race. But who cares about those losers – in Death Inc, you play as the Grim Reaper. Your aim: extermination.Formed in 2011 and based in Guildford,Ambient Studioswas founded by three alumni from Media Molecule, all heavily involved in the creation of revered PlayStation platformer, LittleBigPlanet. Joined by experienced games and movie artist Tim Holleyman, the team went on to recruit ex-staff from other nearby studios such as Criterion and Lionhead and started work on their first project.Death Inc is effectively a real-time strategy simulation, hugely inspired by classic Bullfrog titles like Dungeon and Theme Park. The player takes on the role of just one Reaper, competing to be the most proficiently deadly of the lot; each infected human becomes part of your army and can be used to spread disease to other humans. But your potential victims will fight back with swords and muskets. Luckily, you have other nasties in your armory including swarms of infected rats and exploding livestock."The original idea came from thinking that it would be fun to play a game where you get to control the zombies," says co-founder Mike Green. "We loved the gameplay potential of that scenario, but we weren't too keen on it being yet another zombie game set in an apocalyptic version of the modern world."From there we started trying to think of alternatives for a crowd based RTS/Sim hybrid. One idea we touched upon briefly was controlling little computer 'viruses' that are trying to infect a computer system, but we realised that this would be far too similar to Introversion's fantastic Darwinia".At this point, the team hit on the idea of the plague and its devastation of 17th century England –  a rather terrifying period that the designers didn't want to translate into a horror game. "It was at that point that someone in the studio had the genius idea of the player controlling the 'Grim Reaper' who's trying to make his way in the competitive world of Soul Reaping," says Green. "The game has the same kind of dark humour and fun playful gameplay as the classic Bullfrog titles. We aim to recapture the spirit of those games, but with new innovative mechanics and features for the next generation of gamer."Adding to the more playful feel of the game is its gorgeous art style, harking back to the handicraft aesthetics of LittleBigPlanet. "Tilt shift photography was the starting point," says artist, Tim Holleyman. "A number of games are already using that look really well – Wildfire worlds and the new Sim City in particular. I also love the simplicity and atmosphere of Journey. Colour and lighting are really important, there are a couple of artists at Pixar, Dice Tsutsumi and Noah Klocek, who are a huge influence. And Gustav Klimt and Anders Zorn are amazing!"The team is looking for £300,000 in funding fromits Kickstarter appeal– an ambitious target. After just three days, however, the studio has already reached almost £35,000 and has attracted coverage from a number of specialist gaming sites. The release date on PC and Mac is set for October, but Ambient is not ruling out porting the game to other platforms, including the Wii U, if there's interest.Death Inc is a fascinating concept, and from the demo videos it looks to have a nice, intuitive interface, based around broad tactical movements rather than lots of intricate unit clicking. With the heritage of Media Molecule, Lionhead and Criterion behind it, and the influence of Bullfrog, we'll certainly be watching the progress of this contagion very carefully.
There will be more internet-connected mobile devices such as smartphones and 3G tablets than people in the world before the end of the year, according to new research.A growing category will be internet-connected monitors for "smart metering", video surveilance, maintenance, building automation, healthcare and consumer electronics – a class of device known as "machine-to-machine" (M2M) systems which communicate directly to other computers over the internet without the mediation of humans.Theforecast by the networking giant Ciscosays that the growth in the use of smartphones and tablets will see more than 7bn – the world's current population – in use, with huge growth in use in Asia, the Pacific and Africa.But the rapid growth in connected devices will put the existing internet infrastructure under increasing strain, and force internet providers to shift customers and networks over to the next-generation "IPv6" system – which expands the number of devices that can connect directly to the internet from around 4.3bn (using the existing IPv4 system) to a gigantic figure large enough to give every single person their own private IPv4-based internet.Despite thenear-exhaustion of the IPv4 address spacein February 2012, progress towards wider use of IPv6 has been slow, says Trefor Davies, a driving force behind the adoption of IPv6 in the UK: "in the US, the government has mandated it in some areas, such as the US Navy, but the UK government seems to be concerned about costs." The two protocols are incompatible, and updating systems used by internet service providers to offer a fully IPv6-capable system has put many off, Davies suggested.But the Cisco report points to dramatic change that is already happening in the field of mobile connectivity:• Mobile video already makes up more than half of the data transmitted worldwide, the company says – and by 2017 it will make up two-thirds of it.• The average amount of data consumed by smartphone users rose 81%, from 189MB per month in 2011 to 342MB monthly in 2012.• smartphones consumed 92% of global mobile data traffic, despite only making up 18% of the handsets in use globally. The typical "featurephone" only consumed 6.8MB of data traffic per month – 2% of the amount that the typical smartphone did.By 2017, Cisco says, the average smartphone will generate 2.7GB of data traffic a month – almost a tenfold growth from today, and one that will put enormous demands on the internet backbone.The rapid growth in 4G connections - for which auctions are now underway in the UK - generated a 19-fold larger amount of data traffic than a non-4G connection, Cisco says. Despite only making up 0.9% of all mobile connections - mostly based in the US – 4G connections already make up 19% of data traffic, and the expected rise in such connections will contribute to huge increases in data consumption.3G-connected tablets and laptopsThe number of tablets with 3G or faster connections rose from 14.4m to 35m, and each tablet generated 820MB per month – 2.4 times more data traffic than the average smartphoneThere were 161m 3G-connected laptops, generating seven times more data than the average smartphone – of 2.5 gigabytes per month (which itself was up from 2.3GB in 2011).The fastest growth in device adoption over the next five years will be for tablets, Cisco says – predicting an average 46% growth year on year, and data growth more than doubling, by 113% annually. The next fastest growth will be in "machine to machine modules", which presently make about 5% of internet-enabled devices, growing at 36% annually, and seeing data traffic grow by 89% compound.Smartphones will see 20% growth in numbers, it forecasts, while the data they consume will grow by 81%. The majority will be "featurephones" with internet capability – typified by Nokia's Asha device, which can browse the web and send email but cannot load third-party apps (the latter being the definition of a smartphone used by research companies).But after 2016, says Cisco, the number of featurephones in use overall will begin to drop for the first time ever as smartphones become a larger part of connectivity. "While Asia-Pacific and Middle East and Africa will still show a low single digit growth for non-smartphones, all other regions will experience a decline," the report says. "The highest decline will be experienced by North America (negative CAGR of 37%) and western Europe (negative CAGR of 17%)."With smartphone penetration in the UK already at 58%, and in the US at 54%, the largest opportunities lie in China and Africa – where a number of companies are now pushing with their own smartphone offerings.Growth in internet-connected devicesThe rapid growth in smartphones, 3G- and 4G-connected tablets, dongle-equipped laptops and M2M devices will see the number of internet-connected devices outnumber humans later this year, it says.Geographical growthThe fastest growth in data traffic will be in the Middle East and Africa, which will see a 77% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, while the Asia/Pacific region will see 76% CAGR and Latin America 67%, Cisco says.
Google has overhauled its AdWords advertising network in an attempt to reposition the multi-billion dollar service for the smartphone age.The changes will make it easier for advertisers to target mobile users searching Google from their smartphone or tablet computer.AdWords contributed the bulk of the company's $43bn (£27.4bn) advertising revenues last year, but has yet to take full advantage of the boom in internet searches on the move. The number of daily Google searches from mobile devices is expected to surpass daily desktop searches, from PCs and laptops, by next year.Google's senior vice president of engineering, Sridhar Ramaswamy, announced the changes inan official blogpostlate on Wednesday. "People are constantly connected and moving from one device to another to communicate, shop and stay entertained," he said."And there are many more digital screens and devices to come, with the lines between them continuing to blur."AdWords works as an auction in which advertisers bid to place ads next to specific Google search results. The new system, dubbed "Enhanced Campaigns", will require advertisers to pay for ads on some mobile devices, such as tablet computers, for the first time.Google said that the changes will give advertisers greater control over how much they spend on targeting mobile users at different times and locations, instead of having to "cobble together" a campaign. Previously, companies had to create multiple ad campaigns as part of a process Google admitted was "complex and time-consuming"."With enhanced campaigns, instead of having to cobble together and compare several separate campaigns, reports and ad extensions to do this, the pizza restaurant can easily manage all of this in one single place," said Ramaswamy."Enhanced campaigns help you reach people with the right ads, based on their context like location, time of day and device type, across all devices without having to set up and manage several separate campaigns."For example, a cafe will now be able to bid 25% higher for people using their mobile half a mile away to search for "coffee" or "breakfast". They will also be able to bid less for mobile searches after 11am, when it is less likely that people will want breakfast.Reaction to the changes has been positive, with analysts saying that smaller businesses are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries.Jon Myers, the European commercial director for digital ad firm, Marin Software, said advertisers who had separated campaigns for mobile and desktop users would lose out, but those that did not would benefit."The move has pros and cons for advertisers and agencies. On the plus side, this makes mobile campaigns a lot easier to set-up and manage. This will be particularly helpful for smaller businesses who haven't necessarily had the resource to separate and build out search campaigns in the mobile channel," he said."However, those companies who had already separated out mobile and desktop campaigns, will now have less visibility and control over their mobile campaigns."To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

The online scrapbook sitePinterestis about to embark on a new round of financing that could value the company at up to $2.5bn (£1.6bn).Pinterest, which was set up two years ago, is in talks with potential investors, people familiar with the mattertold the Wall Street Journalas it attracts growing interest from the market.The company runs a free photo-sharing website which allows users to pin and repin images of objects of interest, which are then themed in a grid-like structure. It has yet to reveal any revenue stream but chief executive Ben Silbermann said it is now studying a potential advertising model."A lot of last year was keeping up with growth [and] the big change with touch-screen devices. We're building foundations to monetise," he told the Journal.The company, which had about 20 staff a year ago, now employs 100 and has seen its number of users shoot up to 48 million in December, compared to 9 million in December 2011.Pinterest was valued at $1.5bn when it last raised money in a May 2012 financing round that generated $100m.At the time,Jeremy Levine, a partner at private equity firm Bessermer Venture Partners, who sits on the Pinterest board, said: "They've gotten past the point of being successful with consumers in a big way. At some point, the business has to make money."Investors have singled out Pinterest's ability to boost traffic on partner websites such as allrecipes.com, which says it gets 6.5 times more referrals from Pinterest than Facebook or Twitter.Brian Madden, executive director of social media, for Heart Digital Media, part of the company that publishes magazines including Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire, told the Journal that the "longevity of content is very valuable to us" with Pinterest content resurfacing months after being pinned up, compared to posts on Facebook and Twitter which generate "a lot of interest before fading".• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

According to a new International Data Corporation (IDC) survey of 800 unique respondents, smartphone and tablet users - whom the survey found to be younger, more likely male, have higher incomes, and increasingly hectic travel schedules - are surprisingly more likely than non-users to drive print. Smartphone and tablet users are more likely than non-users to print 16 of 20 business applications from their PCs. The share of users printing from their smartphones and tablets will increase dramatically if users have their way, and the need to enable print and educate users how to print is clear. The percentage of users who printed from their mobile devices increased dramatically in 2012, and the percentage of those who do not print, and do not want to print, will decline from almost 50% in 2012 to just 25% in 2015 according to respondents. However, a large percentage of smartphone and tablet users do not know how to print from their devices, and a large share say their company has not yet enabled mobile printing.Should be a relief for printer-reliant HP, at least.Free as in unlicensed: why the FCC isn't giving away wireless service to anybody &gt;&gt; Project DiscoAfront-page story in the Washington Postoffered a simplified, optimistic read on part of this effort: a proposal to invite unlicensed use of some frequencies liberated by rearranging TV channels.

Triumph motorcycles has maintained its lead as the biggest seller of superbikes in the UK, according to latest figures.Nearly one-in-five of all UK sales of bikes with engines over 500cc are Triumph bikes.The company, owned by John Bloor and chaired by former CBI boss Lord Digby Jones, makes around 50,000 bikes a year at its Hinckley factory, including the Bonneville and Thruxton models. It has increased its research and development pot by 10% to £24m.Latest figures by MCIA, the bike industry trade body, said Triumph had a 19.4% market share in an industry which has suffered in the past few years. In 2008 1.25m motorcycles were sold worldwide, but this dropped to just 690,000 by 2012. In the UK, 3,699 new vehicles were registered last December, a fall of 6.5% compared with a year earlier.However, Triumph has managed to double its worldwide market share since 2007, growing from 2.3% to 5.7%. The company also expanded into 13 new countries, bringing the total to 52, and 85% of the bikes made are exported, according to the business.
The 100th anniversary of the birth of British archaeologist and anthropologist Mary Leakey is celebrated with a Google doodle depicting her at work on a dig.Leakey was born on February 6, 1913 and died in December 1996. She changed her name when she married Louis Leakey, also an anthropologist, in 1936. Her maiden name was Nicol.She is best known for her discovery of the first fossilised Proconsul skull, the skull of an extinct ape which is believed to be an ancestor of humans. Much of her work took place at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania.Leakey took an unusual route to anthropology and archaeology: she disliked formal education and did not pass any exams. It was impossible for her to study for a degree although she took lessons in art and archaeology as an unregistered student at University College London.The doodle shows her surrounded by the tools of her trade and her two dalmations, which she often had with her on digs as she uncovered fossil footprints.
Zynga may have made its first fortune on Facebook, but mobile is  where it sees its lucrative future. The social games publisher's newly mobile-first focus was clear in itslatest financial earnings call.Zynga reportedrevenues of $311mfor the fourth quarter of 2012, and a net loss of $48.6m. Revenues were flat year-on-year, but bookings – the amount actually spent within the company's games – were down 15%. This, in a nutshell, shows why Zynga needs strong mobile growth in 2013."In the third quarter, we realigned our company to a mobile-first focus," chief executive Mark Pincus told analysts in Zynga's earnings call following the results announcement. "We ended the year with more of our new game teams focused on mobile than web."Chief operating officer David Ko expanded on that, telling analysts that whereas two years ago Zynga had around 20 people focused on mobile gaming, now "most of the company is focused on the mobile opportunity as more and more of our players are coming to us from mobile".That's true enough. in Q4 2012, Zynga had 298m monthly active users (MAUs) for its games, including 72m mobile MAUs. Meanwhile, it had 56m daily active users (DAUs) and 20m mobile DAUs.72m mobile MAUs is up 75% year-on-year, with mobile also making more of a contribution to Zynga's bottom line – 21% of its bookings in Q4 2012 compared to 8% a year before.With the other 79% of Q4 2012 bookings being Facebook-related, mobile is starting to offer Zynga the alternative revenue stream it has been craving for some time – to reduce its dependency on the social network.Zynga executives were certainly bullish about the publisher's position in the mobile/social games market, with Pincus claiming that Zynga's US mobile players "spent more time in our game than the next five game companies combined" in December 2012.Ko pointed to data from comScore indicating that Zynga had the fifth-largest daily audience in mobile in the US, behind giants like Google and Facebook. "We likewise rank fifth in overall time spent on mobile, with 10.7 billion minutes in December 2012," he said during the call.While that's impressive, it's clear that a relatively small number of games are shouldering much of Zynga's mobile growth. For example, Pincus said that Words With Friends generated 7.5bn minutes of playtime in December 2012 alone – this is global, rather than US alone.Words With Friends' daily active users jumped 13% year-on-year in Q4 according to Ko, although other games fared less well. Zynga's 72m mobile MAUs may have been up healthily year-on-year, but it was down from 79m in Q3 2012. Pincus said that was " largely due to declines in Draw Something", the drawing gameZynga bought for $200min March 2012.Draw Something's decline has shown that even Zynga doesn't have a midas touch on mobile, although one bright spot in Q4 was the launch of card-battling mobile game Ayakashi, which Ko said has already become "our highest-monetising mobile game on a per-user basis".That points to a big plank in Zynga's mobile strategy for 2013: deeper "midcore" games sitting in between its FarmVille-style casual heritage and hardcore console-style games."Midcore represents our biggest opportunity to reach new audiences and drive growth across web and mobile," said Pincus, who added that Zynga's new-game pipeline is "heavily weighted" towards midcore titles in 2013. "We're planning to launch several more midcore and invest-and-express titles on mobile in 2013," noted Ko.Invest-and-express? That's the phrase Zynga likes to use for games like FarmVille and CityVille. FarmVille 2 has been a big hit on Facebook, and Pincus confirmed that it will be ported to mobile devices in 2013.Interestingly, mobile isn't quite as much at the forefront of Zynga's plans to move into real-money gambling. The company has partnered with gambling firm bwin.party to launch its first web real-money games in the first half of 2013 in the UK: Zynga Plus Casino and Zynga Plus Poker."We'll be rolling out these products in multiple phases across a range of platforms in the U.K., namely via web, download, Facebook, and if we choose, mobile," said Ko. That "if we choose" contrasted sharply with the "mobile-first vision espoused throughout the rest of the call.What Zynga really wants to do in 2013, though, is bring its social gaming network to mobile devices, rather than just individual social games. Pincus suggested in the call that it's still too hard for mobile gamers to find people to play against, despite the availability of Facebook's open graph and (on iOS) Apple's Game Center."We're amazed that the number-one way our Words With Friends players find new opponents in their game is through the 'random' button. We know we can offer them something more compelling than that," said Pincus."What they really want is an instant community, so on mobile, we're creating a network that will make it easier for people to play together. Similar to what we've achieved on the web, this network will offer a powerful distribution channel, so when we and our third-party partners build the best games, they'll be guaranteed the biggest audiences."This isn't a new ambition for Pincus. In fact, when Iinterviewed him in 2009at a very early stage for Zynga's mobile ambitions, he was complaining that Apple hadn't "turned on the plumbing required to make it a great social gaming platform", and brainstorming what the company should do to mirror Facebook's platform.Game Center still isn't that, so Zynga's "instant community" plans will be intriguing to watch in 2013.
It's the middle of the hot Antipodean summer, but when Stephen Elop comes into the room of journalists he's wearing his suit jacket. Nokia's chief executive wipes his brow with a handkerchief and then settles to face an inquisition.The surroundings are august: a swanky penthouse suite in the city of Sydney. The omens are not: of the gaggle of Australian and New Zealand journalists, only the Sydney Morning Herald's writer has a Nokia phone; the others have iPhones or Android phones as recorders. This is the challenge Elop, and Nokia more generally, faces – a smartphone market where the Lumia is in a tiny minority.The challenge has also been heightened by BlackBerry – formerly RIM – seeking to reinvent its offering, with the newly released Z10 handset and BB10 software. With the smartphone market growth slowing, the heat is on for Elop to drive Nokia to success against all those iPhones and Android phones – as well as the rebranded rival from his home country, Canada.Elop says he has visited Australia several times with his family, and loves the place; and he's captured some of those moments – with a Nokia Lumia, of course. He's an engineer by training, after all, and features such as the top-end Lumia 920's optical lens stabilisation (for minimising wobble in pictures or video on the move) matter to him.The local angle disappears fast, however. Despite his apparent familiarity with the territory, neither Elop nor his Australian general manager has any information to share about the Nokia in the antipodes.Questions about seemingly important statistics such as how many employees Nokia Australia has, how much money it makes or for that matter, how many devices it sold last year are met with "we don't break out the figures for our regional operations" by Nokia staff.It's global or nothing for "No-key-a", as Elop pronounces it (though Finns call it "Knock-e-ya"). The company is indeed an international entity, but one whose Finnish roots go back to 1865, when the country was a Russian Grand Duchy.How Nokia fares is deadly serious business in Finland: the company is such a large part of the Nordic country's economy, that even as its decline began in 2008, Nokia's £42.7bn annual turnover was a quarter of Finland's gross domestic product of £163.2bn.In that year, more than 23,000 of the 125,000-plus Nokia staff worldwide were employed in Finland; but last year, Elop closed the last factory in the country andsacked 3,700 of themas part of a larger payroll purge of 10,000 workers.While thelatest set of financial figures are looking up, making Nokia profitable for the first time in six quarters, for a comparatively small country to see employee numbers rapidly shrink over the past few years must be a worry.What do Finns think of Elop's work at Nokia then?"I don't know. You'd have to ask them," Elop replies bluntly, but then quickly adds in a more ameliorative tone: "What I will say is that the level of support that we receive from the people of Finland is intense and intensely positive. The people of Finland have been very supportive of what we're doing."The Finnish media tell a slightly different story. After the June 2012 job cuts, the Finnish Iltalehti paperreported(Google translation) that Elop was accompanied home by security guards.Nevertheless, Elop believes Nokia's downsizing and outplacement programmes are a good thing for Finland. "I think you'll see over time that entire new industries, or extensions of the technology industry which we're in, have been formed because of how we've approached this," he says. "We think that's good not only for Finland, but ultimately for Nokia as well," he adds.Tablets, phablets and AndroidPerhaps the effects of downscaling as old markets evaporate and the company goes "from being a leader to a challenger", as Elop sees it, is a positive development, but surely selling more devices is what it should do?Where are the tablets and "phablets" – the in-between phones with screens larger than 5in diagonally, as pioneered by Dell's Streak. Elop says Nokia is considering them, and looking into platform options such as Windows 8, Windows RT – as used on the Microsoft Surface – and even Android.Well, not really Android: Elop says Nokia is a latecomer to Google's hugely successful mobile operating system, and that market is now owned by Samsung. Also, going Android could mean being forced to use Google properties such as Maps instead of Nokia's Navteq equivalent and joining the Open Handset Alliance."Yes, you can call it [Android] open source but in practicality, you're getting more and more constrained on what's possible in that environment," Elop says. "I've said repeatedly that our primary focus is Windows Phone. Other ecosystems going sideways at this point doesn't make sense."Elop won't explain though how that differs from being tied to Microsoft in a three-legged race where Redmond decides not only the pace at which to run – through the timing of its OS upgrades – but also where and how to run, in terms of the interface and features.Microsoft or bust"The Lumia product, using Windows Phone software works better than anything else with the Microsoft systems like the Exchange mail capability or SharePoint, and of course we're therefore aggressively going after the business marketplace as well," Elop says.Lumia handsets running Windows Phone – whether the new 620 or the already-launched 820 or top-end 920 models – are where the action is for Nokia. Being different from the mass is the key; using Windows Phone is part of that strategy.Elop proudly shows off some night-time photos from Helsinki that he was able to take on the 920 in low light, thanks to the camera's anti-shake system, and points to other cloud-based features on the platform such as music, navigation, entertainment and office productivity that's part of the Windows Phone eco-system.But Nokia isn't quite sticking to a single-platform strategy, and Microsoft doesn't drive it everywhere. In fact, its top-selling smartphones are the Asha devices running the Series 40 software introduced in 1999. Nokia sold 9.3m Asha devices in the fourth quarter, and 2.2m Symbian ones – the latter being the"burning platform" from which Elop, and Nokia, jumped off in February 2011. In comparison, it shipped 4.4m Lumia smartphones in that crucial fourth quarter.You can wrangle over the definition: analysts such as Gartner and IDC don't class the Asha as a smartphone (because it won't run third-party apps). But it does offer web browsing and email. Equally, the Asha range retails at much lower price than the Lumia phones – Elop says it's in a price band "roughly below $100 (£65)" and that Nokia has had "remarkable success" with selling the phones in less wealthy markets where people are very sensitive about the ongoing cost of the device in question.The Lumia is aimed at wealthier markets – and China. Nokia has signed a deal with China Mobile to sell the Lumia 920T there on its unique TD-SCDMA (time division synchronous code division multiple access protocol for data) low-speed cellular network – a protocol that isn't used anywhere else in the world. But China Mobile has more than 700 million subscribers – more than all its rivals combined.BlackBerry: revival?Nokia can't count on having the business market to itself, with a revitalised BlackBerry, which has the advantage of having already been the darling of corporates and governments – until the iPhone came along and crushed it, with Android devices in tow.What's more, the new BB10 OS makes porting Android apps possible, potentially giving the Canadian company access to a vast number of popular applications already used by millions of customers.Elop dismisses that, saying that porting to BlackBerry only works for apps that don't connect to Google services. Also, porting will only work if the apps happen to align to a particular screen size he says."In a broad sense, it's a good general approach – but in practicality, it doesn't take you very far," he says.Native apps is the way to go, he says, and points to the Microsoft Windows Phone platform: "When we started with Microsoft, there were 6,000 applications on the Lumia platform; now there are 125,000," he says. What's more, some of those are "differentiating applications, things that you can get on our platform but not on other platforms, and we think it's very advantageous."Urgency or emergency?Elop recognises that technology waits for no one, and that Nokia can't rest on its now frayed laurels. "If you look at everything that changed just in 2012 or 2011 or 2010 all the way back to the iPhone in 2007, so much has been changing each year and that's going to continue this year for sure," he says.The market is accelerating, Elop says, with device life cycles dropping to six months from two years. Companies have to move faster – but not only that, they must be accountable and listen to and hear what their customers actually want.This year will tell if it is Nokia and Windows Phone 8. If not, urgency will translate into emergency for Nokia. And the heat will really rise for Elop.• Update:Charles Arthur writes: some commenters here and elsewhere have said that the Asha should be classed as a smartphone because it can run third-party apps. We have asked the research company Gartner to clarify this. Here's what a spokesperson said:"Gartner says the Asha is a mobile phone not a smartphone. Gartner defines smartphones as having an open operating system:"Open Operating System: an OS for which a software developer kit is available to developers, who can use native APIs to write applications. The OS can be supported by a sole vendor or multiple vendors. It can be, but does not have to be, open source. Examples are BlackBerry OS, iOS, Symbian, Android, Windows Phone, Linux, LiMo Foundation, webOS and bada."It's the lack of a native API that means S40, used on the Asha range, isn't classed as a smartphone OS. Neither Gartner nor IDC, the other principal research company in this field, classes the Asha range as a "smartphone". Nokia itself does not include Asha sales in its "Smart Devices" classification in its financial results (see here for Q4 2012; PDF); it only includes Windows Phone and Symbian.
If H.P. Lovecraft was right and the greatest type of fear is fear of the unknown, then it stands to reason that any horror franchise faces problems when it hits its third iteration. Once a horror series can lay claim to a fan base, it's faced with something of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has a proven audience and willing consumers. On the other, it has to up the ante considerably; how do you scare an audience, after all, who – to a degree – know what to expect? Unless a horror sequel attempts to build on the unsettling foundations of its forebear, audiences simply wind up with re-packaged scares.This is the reality that any Dead Space fans who pick up a copy of the latest instalment in EA's sci-fi horror series are staring down the barrel of. I can't speak to the experience of someone whose entry into the franchise is Dead Space 3 – you may be frightened out of your wits when you play this game for all I know. But I can speak for veterans of the series and here comes some bad news: if you've played through any of the games in this franchise – especially the first terrifying entry – you're not likely to find much in Dead Space 3 that'll make your hair stand on end.The reason for this is because, if you're a fan of this series, a lot of Dead Space 3's beats feel telegraphed. The game's flailing monstrosities, the Necromorphs – which looked so thoroughly disturbing in the series' first outing – are now all-too familiar, and so too is the way some of them play possum until the player approaches. The way the monsters regularly attack from both the front and the rear is no longer challenging as much as it is annoying, as is the way the developers make use of the game's unwieldy camera – positioned over the protagonist's right shoulder – to blindside the player.Like all the other Dead Space games, most of the action takes place in badly-lit clanking corridors. There are a couple of sections set in the vacuum of space and outdoors on an ice-covered planet, but players will find a lot of their surroundings quite familiar.There are a couple of new additions to the Necomorph pack, but on the whole they're not great departures, visually speaking. No creature in the game, new or old, appears or behaves in any way likely to prompt spine-chills and, jack-in-the-box scares aside, players can always pre-empt an attack – (not-so-)pro-tip: if you enter a wide area filled, say, with catwalks and airvents and the door suddenly slams shut behind you, you're in for a fight.Where the action isSo Dead Space 3 isn't as frightening as earlier instalments. What it is, instead, is far more slick and action-orientated. Dead Space 3 may lack moments of out-and-out terror, but it more than makes up for this with its high-octane tempo. The game's narrative shifts its protagonist (or protagonists) swiftly between action set-pieces, with barely time to draw breath. The characters' movements are also less sluggish than in previous games and a dodge-roll mechanic has been mapped to the left bumper.The speed is complimented beautifully by the variety in activities; one moment, players are gunning a hallway full of monsters, in the next, they're operating a gun turret, before leaping into zero-gravity and blasting creatures that are approaching them from every angle. The developers even find time to litter the player's progression with a ton of puzzles and the odd boss fight. Whatever other complaints one may level at Dead Space 3, "being bored" isn't one of them.The game's pace is so relentless, it even manages to obscure just how knuckle-headed the plot is. After a brief prologue, players are reintroduced to Isaac Clarke, space engineer and traumatised survivor of the horrors from outer space. It seems between Dead Space 2 and 3, Clarke became involved with Ellie – the heroine from the second game who had her eye gouged out – but their relationship curdled and now Clarke spends his days staring at her picture (and pictures of alien artefacts) in a dingy apartment.Clarke's storyline kicks off when he's contacted by a couple of military types called Carver and Norton who want him to help them track Ellie down. It seems she disappeared somewhere near an ice-covered planet called Tau Volantis, which also happens to be the source of something called The Marker – an item that turns humans into Necromorphs. Clarke and his newfound companions head off to rescue Ellie, but not before The Unitologists – an insane cult who believe Clarke to be a heretic – try to fill them full of lead.This rather elaborate set-up quickly becomes a convoluted mess, but players are likely to be having such a lot of fun dismembering Necromorphs by then they'll hardly notice. Blasting through enemies isn't just satisfying, it's also profitable. Nearly every downed opponent drops an item, which players can put towards filling health meters, crafting new weapons, kitting out their armour or bolstering the game's Stasis and Kinetic Field mechanics. Dead Space 3 has also done away entirely with different ammunition types for different weapons; players now collect ammo clips that fit every type of weapon in the game.Get your hands dirtyThe reason for this is the game's new weapon-crafting mechanic. In past games, players could use workstations (called Benches) to augment weapons in Clarke's arsenal with Power Nodes. Now, alongside being able to craft health-packs and ammo clips, they can use the Benches to build weapons from scratch with items dropped by slaughtered foes or what they find lying about.Depending on what brackets and components they pick up – as well as how many transponders, semi-conductors and tungsten pieces they have – they can create customised instruments of death. They can, for example, tinker with a line thrower, so that its head swivels in the same way as a plasma cutter. They can bolt a grenade launcher to a machine gun or a shotgun barrel to a flamethrower. My favourite creation paired a forcefield gun with ripper core; its primary attack would knock over whole groups of enemies allowing me to then walk a ripper blade through them as they struggled to get up.Of course, anyone following the Dead Space 3 news feed will know that the weapon crafting mechanic contains optional micro-transactions. Every Bench has a list of blueprints for weapons which players can build and the opportunity to use real cash to buy any parts they may lack for their construction. It has to be said, this leaves a bit of a nasty taste in the mouth and it completely goes against Dead Space's survival horror roots – after all, exactly how scary can a game be when you can buy your way out of trouble? However, it should be pointed out that it's possible to complete the game without doing this and during the campaign, players acquire three scrounger robots to aid in their collection of raw materials.They'll also find a hefty stack of optional side missions they can embark on – all of which end with them finding a container of loot. Admittedly, some of these are simply straightforward run-and-gun affairs with only a negligible impact on the overall plot, but a couple have pretty well-crafted narratives – one involving a lazy hick who taunts the player over an intercom system is particularly memorable. Players will also come across locked pathways, which they can access by using a tungsten lever, which they have to craft at a Bench.Co-op is no flopThere are also several locked rooms and routes that can only be accessed in Co-op Mode, which fans of the series have dreaded since it was announced at E3 last year. However, far from feeling shoehorned into the proceedings, Co-op Mode is actually very well implemented. In it, one player controls Clarke and the other controls Carver, and the mode does a lot to flesh out the latter character who, in Single-Player, is reduced to just a bit-player. In Co-op, Carver starts to fall prey to the influence of The Marker, and the player controlling him starts to see evidence of his growing psychosis.In Co-op, puzzles become a two-handed affair, with one player having to cover the other's back while they fiddle with a control panel or hack a console. It also lends more weight to the weapon-crafting mechanic, as players can wield up to four weapons between the pair of them, bolstering the capabilities within their overall arsenal. The only real drawbacks are the fact that a player can find themselves shunted back to an earlier checkpoint should their partner leave the game and facing the Dead Space universe with a mate isn't as tense as going it alone.And that final point may prove the sticking point with fans of the earlier games. Really, one's enjoyment of Dead Space 3 depends on how much one is prepared to surrender to Visceral's new vision for their horror IP. If you're after a rollicking action title that provides countless opportunities to blast away at slavering monsters, Dead Space 3 could well be one of the most exciting titles you play all year. But if you're one of the Dead Space faithful who was seduced by this series' ability to deliver a survival horror experience shot through with moments of white-knuckled terror, be warned: Dead Space 3 has left that terrain and doesn't look set to return to it any time soon.• Game reviewed on Xbox 360• UK release date: Friday 8 February

Microsoft's Surface Windows 8 Pro– a fascinating combination of tablet and laptop – is the company's most innovative product in years. But I'm not ready to buy one, yet.After trying out a new Surface Pro, which has just gone on sale and uses Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 8, I'm putting it in the category of a fine Version 1 product. Or maybe, that should be Version 2, since Microsoft and its Windows hardware partners for years sold stylus-operated tablets based on previous versions of Windows. What long-time Microsoft watchers know is that the company often has a way of getting things right with Version 3.Of course, "right" is a relative word in a tech ecosystem that has changed enormously since Microsoft's 1990s heyday, when it bestrode the personal computing world with a nearly unparalleled monopoly, created and maintained through an assortment of abusive tactics that led to a landmark anti-trust action. That case, and the company's desire to protect its fabulously lucrative Windows and Office software franchises, led to a decade of still-high profits but an increasing sense in the tech community that its best days were behind – or even that it might, sooner than later, become roadkill under the wheels of more nimble innovators.I don't rule out a Microsoft meltdown one of these years, because it's not clear that the company can make the shift from its monopoly power to a truly competitive market. But with products like the Surface, I wouldn't write it off.The Surface Pro is a companion to the RT Surface line that – foolishly, in my view – went on sale last year. The RT has gone nowhere in the market for many good reasons, not least that it doesn't run regular Windows software. Its only advantage over the Pro is that it's lighter – hardly enough to matter when other, still lighter, and overall better tablets are available from Apple and Android device makers. From my perspective, the RT confused potential customers.The essential thing to remember about the Surface Pro is that it's a nicely designed personal computer that can double reasonably well as a tablet. The iPad and its bigger-screen Android tablets are touch-screen mobile devices that can be used, not all that well, as personal computers for certain tasks.The Pro starts with a disconnected 10.6in tablet screen, with touch-enabled Windows 8 as its dashboard. This operating system, despite its unfinished and often confusing nature, is growing on me. (One of the reasons Windows 8 is so confusing is that you can, and often need to, return to the desktop interface of prior Windows versions, and it's not always clear what applications are using what. It's like two operating systems bolted together.) The "Metro" user interface (officially renamed "Modern UI") is a different tablet experience than the iOS and Android, but it's intuitive and much more attractive at first glance. The live tiles, essentially mini-windows into apps when they're done best, have lots of potential, as Android's newer operating systems have shown with what Google calls widgets.Microsoft has created a Windows 8 app marketplace much like Apple's online store and Google Play app market. It's not as big as either of the latter stores, but I found many (though not all) of the apps I use on other platforms, or good-enough equivalents. Since Microsoft has superb software development tools, you can expect to find just about anything you need there over time, and meanwhile, the standard Windows-based software, at least programs written for Windows 7, will run as well.As a tablet, the Pro leaves some things to be desired. It's far too heavy, for example, weighing in at 2lb – far heavier than the competition. It does have a kickstand, but only one viewing angle when using it. An adjustable kickstand would be better. The battery life is non-stellar, about 4 hours, thanks, in large part, to the power-draining Intel i-5 chip that serves as the device's central brain. Intel is way behind the competition in making chips for the mobile space, at least in this regard, though it's working hard to make up lost ground.I won't describe all the hardware features, but here are several key ones. The $899 base model comes with 64GB of storage, less than half of which is free space after Windows and various apps are installed at the factory, and the preferable unit, costing $100 more, has 128GB, with 83GB free afterward. Storage grows easily with up to 64GB of removable flash memory, plus a USB 3.0 port that lets users plug in external hard drives and other peripherals.The Intel chip gives the Surface Pro an advantage, one that, in my tryout of the machine, led me to use it much more as a laptop-like computer than a tablet. It's a genuine Windows computer. To use it that way, however, you absolutely, positively need a keyboard: Microsoft's on-screen keyboard is not much fun for typing, to put it mildly.Microsoft offers two keyboard choices, both of which plug into the tablet and create a functioning computer. There's a "Touch Cover" ($120) with keys that respond to pressure but don't move under your fingers; and a vastly better "Type Cover" ($130) with keys that do move. I found it to be easy to write with this keyboard, which is not always true of small devices. Both keyboards serve nicely as screen covers. A bluetooth "Wedge Mouse" came in handy, as the touchpad on the keyboard was not to my liking – not least for the inability to turn off the tap-as-mouse-click functionality.I wouldn't buy one now, though I very much like the idea of a device that can be a real PCanda tablet. One thing we know about technology is that it gets smaller and more powerful. So another iteration of the Surface Pro is likely, one hopes, to be more svelte, so it can be a better tablet, along with an iteration of Windows 8 (probably Windows 9) to fix the many crazy design choices in the operating system.As Microsoft moves more firmly into selling its own PC and tablet hardware (and I'll be phones, too, one of these days), it has a chance to get more of this right. That's bad news for its equipment partners unless they do a better job in design and manufacturing, which they've largely failed to do. Microsoft's investment in the Dell buyout may suggest it's found a favored partner, but the point is that better hardware is not an option in an Apple-infused world.The Surface Pro is an excellent beginning. Now let's see Microsoft take it to a logical conclusion.
Plans for two debt-backed mega-deals, reminiscent of the pre-financial crisis buyout frenzy, were unveiled yesterday when computer-maker Dell and cable TV group Virgin Media confirmed they are both close to being bought out in deals each worth more than $20bn (£12.8bn).Dell announced it would be sold for $24.4bn to a consortium comprised of founder Michael Dell, software giant Microsoft and  private equity group Silver Lake. It is the biggest confirmed deal since the credit crunch took hold in 2007, followed by theimplosion of Lehman Brothersin September 2008.Separately, John Malone's Liberty Global said it is in talks with Virgin Media, which has about 4.9m cable TV customers. Bankers put a price tag of more than $20bn on the business. If successful the takeover will see the US billionaire lock horns with occasional rival Rupert Murdoch in the pay-TV battlefield. Murdoch, who controls BSkyB, was forced to sell Malone his valuable stake in satellite broadcaster DirecTV in 2006, in order to get Malone to offload a threatening stake of almost 20% that the Liberty boss had built up in Murdoch's News Corporation empire.Mathew Horsman, director of strategic analysis and financing company Mediatique, said the deals suggested investors' confidence was improving: "There has been a lot of pent-up cash sloshing around, with people being willing to deal once the market is right. Until now, it seems like people have been concerned about whether there would be a proper recovery or not."Each of the two deals is larger than any since Blackstone Group's $26bn leveraged buyout of Hilton Hotels in summer 2007. They carry echoes of the pre-crash acquisition boom that saw a welter of leverage-backed deals, from the Ferrovial-led acquisition of Heathrow owner BAA for £10.3bn in 2006 to the $45bn (£29bn) buyout of Texan utility TXU by a US private equity consortium a year later.James Dailey, portfolio manager at TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told Reuters: "We seem to be in this manic buying period, and people are reluctant to give up the optimism that the market is going to move higher."For Dell, the world's third largest PC maker, it will mean a retreat from the stock market after almost 25 years as a publicly listed company. The company was founded by Michael Dell in 1984 while he was still at university. He will retain a 16% stake; shareholders will receive $13.65 per share – a 54% premium on its lowest point last November, but a drastic fall from its $18.30 high in February 2012.The deal has been driven by Dell's desire to reshape the company away from the stock market. Profits from PCs have slumped, and it is being challenged by Asian rivals,  Lenovo, Asus and Acer.Liberty Global's decision to bid for Virgin Media will pit owner Malone in a head-to-head battle with Murdoch and BSkyB, which has so far won out over Virgin Media in the contest for pay-TV subscribers with nearly double the customer base at more than 10 million people.Liberty Global's pay-TV operations stretch from Chile to Switzerland, but it has no presencein the UK. The move is the second time in five years Liberty Media has looked at Virgin, which is listed on the US Nasdaq exchange, and had a market capitalisation of just over $10bn on Monday night. It also has $5bn of debt. The shares climbed 16% to $45 yesterday. A year ago they were changing hands at $21.Richard Branson's Virgin Group owns just under 3% of the company, which at an expected bid price of $47 would be worth some $380m. Branson currently receives a percentage of its revenues as an annual royalty; last year that amounted to roughly £10m. Branson cannot veto a deal.Virgin Media chief executive Neil Berkett, who joined the business in 2006 when it was seen as a basket case, could bank nearly  $30m from a Liberty takeover."I'd think the Virgin board will bite Liberty's arm off to accept this," said Horsman. Tax losses carried by Virgin Media could lower the tax burden if Liberty's bid succeeds, Horsman added.The FTSE has risen more than 4% since the start of the year, as investors have apparently regained confidence in businesses' ability to weather the economic storms."The debt markets are wide open," Daniel Tiemann, head of transactions and restructuring services in the Americas for KPMG, told Bloomberg. "It's like the party's all set and we're just waiting for the sellers to show up. Confidence is what is going to make the sellers show up."
Two thirds of Facebook users have taken a voluntary break from the site for several weeks or more, citing reasons ranging from "excessive gossip or drama from their friends" to "concerns about privacy", according to new research.But much as its critics might like to think otherwise, the world's most popular social network is showing no signs of losing its audience. The most common reason stated for taking a break is that users are too busy, following by "just wasn't interested" and that it's a "waste of time".According to a new survey published by the USPew Research Center, only 4% of Facebook users cited privacy issues, with just 1% saying they did not like to share their lives via Facebook. Only 2% said they preferred to communicate face to face.Some of the comments from those that were polled included "I was tired of stupid comments" and "I had crazy friends. I did not want to be contacted". Others cited the mundane nature of their friends' posts – "People were posting what they had for dinner" – or "I didn't like being monitored".Pew found the vast majority, 92%, still maintained a profile on the social networking site with two thirds saying the site is as important in their lives now as it was a year ago.But a significant minority, just under a third, said the site is less important to them now and just over a third reported they have decreased the amount of time they have been on the site.Just over one in 10 said they spend more time on the site, particularly women.Of concern to Facebook will be reports of decreased usage among 18 to 29-year-olds, with 42% saying the amount of time they spend on the social network in a typical day has decreased in the last 12 months.Pew Research is a non-partisan think tank based in Washington, which conducts online behaviour surveys on internet usage, both in and outside the US. The survey was conducted in December and based on a sample of 1,006 American adults aged 18 and over.
