An unexpectedly sharp downturn in revenues at computing giant IBM has sent its shares tumbling and dealt another blow to investor Warren Buffett.IBM, nicknamed “big blue” for its once ubiquitous logo, earned $22.4bn (£13.8bn) during its third quarter – a 4% fall on the previous year and almost $1bn lower than market expectations.IBM shares fell by more than 7% in pre-market trading, initially costing Buffett $1bn on his stake. As the second largest stock on the Dow Jones index, IBM was expected to depress the New York market all day.“We are disappointed in our performance,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM’s chairman and chief executive. “We saw a marked slowdown in September in client-buying behaviour, and our results also point to the unprecedented pace of change in our industry.”Buffett’s firm Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest shareholder in IBM with a 7% stake, having bought shares in the world’s biggest technology services firm in 2011. It comes after he admitted his investment in Tesco supermarkets was a “huge mistake” and began selling the stake.As expected, IBM also announced it would pay the Abu Dhabi-owned firm GlobalFoundries $1.5bn (£930m) to take its unprofitable chip design and manufacturing business off its hands.IBM will pay GlobalFoundries the sum over three years and will receive $200m in assets in return, making the net value of the deal $1.3bn.New York-based IBM made pioneering strides in semiconductor technology, but its microelectronics division has struggled in recent years as each new generation of microchips requires costly upgrades to plants and equipment.High costs have forced many players out of the market, meaning IBM found few buyers when it first tried to sell its unprofitable chip-making business last year.IBM had initially hoped to sell the loss-making business for $2bn,according to the Wall Street Journal. Analysts expressed surprise that IBM was paying GlobalFoundries rather than the other way round, but suggested it may reflect the cost of adapting IBM factories to make specialised chips.The parent company of GlobalFoundries, which manufactures chips to order for other companies, is a technology investment fund wholly owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.GlobalFoundries has headquarters in California’s Silicon Valley, as well as offices and plants in New York and Austin.The firm is said to be more interested in acquiring IBM’s engineers and intellectual property than the factories.It said it would take over IBM’s manufacturing operations in East Fishkill, New York and Essex Junction, Vermont, and offer jobs to substantially all IBM employees affected by the deal. IBM was also hurt by falling revenues in emerging markets, with earnings in Brazil, Russia, India and China down 7%.The slowdown in earnings was bad news for Buffett, who shunned the tech sector for most of his 50-year career, but began buying IBM stock in 2011, after praising the firm’s management for rescuing it from the brink of bankruptcy 20 years before. .IBM’s microchip division accounts for less than 2% of its revenues, but was losing the company around $1.5bn a year. Big tech companies are attempting to refashion themselves for the age of cloud computing, where data and programmes are stored on the internet rather than a computer hard drive.Rometty highlighted cloud computing and mobile technology as priorities for IBM and promised to accelerate the development of its business in those areas.The company completed its $2.1 billion sale of the x86 server business to Chinese rival Lenovo Group earlier this month.
Journalists should be able to rely on a public interest defence if they break some laws relating to computer misuse, data protection and bribery, Nick Clegg has said.The Liberal Democrat leader said he believed journalists should be able to go after information in the public interest without fear of being prosecuted.He spoke out at his monthly press conference before a debate in the House of Lords on Monday night, where a Lib Dem peer will table amendments proposing public interest defences to the crime and criminal justice bill.“I think there should be a basically a public interest defence put in law,” Clegg said. “You probably need to put it in the Data Protection Act, the Bribery Act, maybe one or two other laws as well, where you enshrine a public interest defence for you, for the press. So that where you are going after information and you’re being challenged, you can set out a public interest defence to do so.”Liberal Democrat sources said they did not think the amendments would be pushed to a vote and were hopeful that they might get agreement with the Conservatives about putting forward some government proposals “in the not too distant future”.Asked about whether the government could back a public interest defence for journalists, the prime minister’s official spokesman said it would look at ideas that emerge from the review of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa).This legislation is being reviewed following concern about police getting access to journalists’ phone records to hunt for their sources.Clegg said: “Let’s have the review of Ripa and look at what ideas and proposals may emerge from that, both obviously specifically in the context of Ripa and whether there is potentially a wider application to those ideas and proposals. I’m sure that people will listen to what is said in the chamber.”The amendments propose a new defence for journalists who unlawfully obtain personal data (section 55 of the Data Protection Act) where they do so as part of a story that is in the public interest, a public interest defence in the Computer Misuse Act, and a public interest defence in the Bribery Act.Another amendment would raise the maximum penalty for unlawfully obtaining personal data under section 55 from a fine to include the possibility of probation, community service and, in the most serious cases, imprisonment for up to two years.They follow vote at the Liberal Democrat party conference in Glasgow that called for “effective public interest defences in [the Data Protection Act] and others (including the Computer Misuse Act 1990, RIPA and the Bribery Act 2000) to protect responsible journalism, and ensuring greater protection for legally privileged and journalistic material from requests for telephone and other records”.A senior Liberal Democrat source said the party was “supportive of the principle of the amendments, which are designed to defend this country’s proud tradition of investigate journalism”.“These amendments aren’t yet government policy. They are being floated by one of our backbenchers in the House of Lords to see what the reaction of the other parties is,” he added. “The Liberal Democrats are currently working in government to secure support across the coalition for these protections.”Separately, Clegg emphasised that he supported the government’s moves to review Ripa, as there should be greater protections for journalists before police can access their records.“It’s incredibly important in a free society that journalists should be able to go after information where there’s a clear public interest to do so, without fear of being snooped upon or having all of their files kind of rifled through without clear justification,” the deputy prime minister said.“I think where the police basically ask you, if I can put it like that, for information which might reveal your sources, in the sort of privileged information, I think that shouldn’t just be done at the say so of the police officer, even of a senior police officer.“I think it should be done at the say so of a judge. I think it’s a big thing to say to the press in this country: ‘We can demand where you got your information from and we don’t even need to go to a judge to do so.’ I think that needs to change.”A Liberal Democrat peer has also made a last-minute attempt to water down the government’s new law on mandatory jail sentences for people convicted twice of possessing a knife.Lord Marks of Henley-on-Thames has laid an amendment calling for all under-18s to be exempt from the legislation, which would currently apply to anyone over the age of 16.There has been a long-running dispute between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats over compulsory jail sentences for knife offences, which caused a coalition rift earlier this year.The Conservative leadership backed an amendment brought forward by backbencher Nick de Bois proposing a custodial term for second offenders, but the Lib Dems argued it should be up to the discretion of judges.In the end, the Conservatives and Labour clubbed together to get the amendment accepted by the House of Commons in June in the first time the two parties have collaborated on legislation while excluding the Lib Dems.De Bois, who led the campaign for tougher sentences, condemned the Lib Dem position.“To kill someone with a knife you first have to carry a knife - [the] Lib Dems are wrong to try a last-minute block of mandatory custodial sentence,” he said.The amendment will be debated during the report stage of the crime and criminal justice bill in the House of Lords on Monday night.However, Liberal Democrat sources said they did not expect the proposal to gain much traction with the other parties.
iCloud users in China are the target of a “man in the middle” attack, most likely run by the Chinese state on connections passing into and out of the country, surveillance experts say.The attack on the storage service began on Monday, the same day the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were released in China for the first time. It intercepts data passed between the user and iCloud.com, Apple’s cloud computing service, by routing all communication between the two through a malicious third party.Typically, iCloud.com employs the SSL internet security protocol to establish a secure connection. To get around that, the Chinese attacker has used a self-signed certificate, which is enough to trick users of insecure browsers into thinking they’ve accessed the iCloud website through a secure connection.“This is clearly a malicious attack on Apple in an effort to gain access to usernames and passwords and consequently all data stored on iCloud, such as iMessages, photos, and contacts”, wrote the Chinese internet freedom organisation Great Fire. “If users ignored the security warning and clicked through to the Apple site and entered their username and password, this information has now been compromised by the Chinese authorities.The organisation speculated that the attack“may also somehow be related again to images and videos of the Hong Kong protests being shared on the mainland.”SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, the protocol used to secure iCloud, relies on certificates signed by one of a number of trusted authorities to verify that the site being connected to isn’t intercepted by an eavesdropper. The attack made use of a self-signed certificate, which claims to be iCloud.com but isn’t supported by a trusted third party. Most modern secure browsers will reject such certificates, but notably,360 Secure Browser, a popular browser developed by Chinese firm Qihoo, does not.The “great firewall” is a notoriously imprecise censorship tool, frequently blocking sites on a piecemeal basis or allowing access for seemingly random periods of time, and the iCloud intercept is no different: the attack only occurs if users visit one particular IP address, meaning that it’s possible to simply reload the site and try again.As well as running a secure browser which will reject self-signed certificates, one way users can stay safe against attacks like this is by enabling two-step verification on their accounts. That won’t stop any attacker seeing what the target looks at – the equivalent of browsing over their shoulder – but it does mean that if usernames and passwords are stolen, they can’t be used to gain access to the compromised account.Apple declined to comment.The great firewall of China gets metaphorical
When I was a 19 year-old student, I had gig ticketing down to a fine art: Buy the NME and Melody Maker magazines first thing on a Wednesday, scan their live listings for bands that I liked, then queue up to buy tickets as soon as they went on sale.Fast forward a few years, and technology was playing more of a role through online booking and – particularly for in-demand concerts – the pattern of sitting at a computer with umpteen browser windows open, hitting refresh from just before 9am until tickets had been secured.Fast forward again, to 2014, and my smartphone is playing its part in the process: theSongkickapp pings me when an artist I like has a gig coming up, often ahead of the official announcement. Sometimes, I even buy the tickets on my phone, although the experience can still be overly fiddly.Could a new app calledDice, which launched in the UK in mid-September, be the next step on? Perhaps.Dice is a joint venture between veteran music manager Phil Hutcheon and digital studio ustwo. The latter is the developer behind theWhale TrailandMonument Valleymobile games, but is also a creative agency working for brands like Sony, Google and Barclays – all experiences that have influenced Dice’s Android and iPhone app.“We’ve gone out and got the best designers, the best data people and the best marketing people to make something that’s miles different,” Hutcheon tells the Guardian. “Our focus has been on whether this is good for fans and artists.”What is Dice, then? In its current form, it’s a guide to upcoming concerts in London – more cities will be added in the coming months – which also sells tickets for those gigs without booking fees, with the tickets stored within the app ready to be scanned on the door.“We’re getting rid of the friction: it’s purely about fans going to a show, and all the possibilities that brings. That’s what was in our mind while we were making this,” says Hutcheon.He adds that Dice is aiming to be an alternative to touts on the street as well as “secondary ticketing” websites that sell tickets for sold-out shows at inflated prices, with some artists controversially taking a share of the profits.“We’re empowering artists to control ticketing. As a manager and as a fan, I’ve never bought a ticket on the secondary market. I don’t agree with it. Dice is a piece of technology that means the tickets will never make it there,” he said.“If you’re a credible artist and fans find out you’re participating in the secondary market, you’re kinda dead. No one’s profiting from it except maybe for the companies and venture capitalists backing the secondary market.”Hutcheon claims that Dice is built to scale quickly if needed – “we can sellout the equivalent of Wembley Stadium in a minute, and allocate those tickets, without crashing” – but adds that Dice will expand carefully both in terms of adding new features to its app, and adding new cities and countries.For now, the app features more than 100 concerts at once, with an editorial team working under DJ and journalistJen Longto choose the gigs and write their listings. In time, the app will include features to help fans listen to the artists they don’t know already, with YouTube videos likely the first method.Dice is also courting music fans with its Waiting List feature, where fans can join a queue for tickets for a sold-out concert in case more become available; exclusive concerts from some artists; and plans to recommend gigs and bands based on their past purchases.“This is going to be a curated platform for a maximum of 200 shows at one point: it’s not any show, it’s the best shows in London,” says Hutcheon. “But once we add the personalisation engine in to it, we can start segmenting: if you’re really into clubs and dance music, we’ll show you less of the other stuff.”“We’ve launched a product as lean as we’re comfortable with, but just as you’ll see more bands coming on board, you’ll also see the experience massively increase every few weeks,” adds co-founder Matt “Mills” Miller.Dice’s app includes a waiting list feature for sold-out gigs.Dice isn’t just a digital startup: it has recruited a team of reps to attend every gig, greeting people who’ve bought tickets through the app, and telling other attendees what it is and how it works.“They’re super-confident, super-engaged music fans,” says Mills. “And they’re talking directly to the fans and giving us their feedback, which is so rewarding.That’s one reason for the cautious expansion, with plans to take Dice to cities across the UK first, then Europe before setting its sights on the US. For now, music will be its sole focus, too.“Sports is definitely an area that needs change, where it’s hard to get hold of tickets,” says Mills. “But this guy’s passion [he motions to Hutcheon] is absolutely about music, and ours is about making the product right. We need to own music. Beyond that, only once we’ve learned about music can we take our learnings into other areas.”For now, the Dice team are continuing to visit managers and artists to sell them on the potential benefits of the app: particularly the ability to get useful data on how their fanbases are growing, which can then be used to build their careers. Hutcheon says this is based on his own experience as a manager.“I’ve been wanting to use data to help run artists’ businesses for a while now. We had the same ticketing companies trying to sell our tickets, everyone had the same 10% booking fee, and they would give us a CSV [spreadsheet] file with email addresses that were meaningless,” he says.“In the music industry, we haven’t had access to the right data to make decisions. “Should my artist play in Paris? Who should they play with? Is this the right time to go to America? If Shepherds Bush sells out, should I do another or go to Brixton Academy? And so on.”What about Dice’s business? The margins in selling mobile tickets are wafer-thin even with booking fees, so for now, Dice is relying on the resources of Hutcheon and ustwo, along with £1m of funding from investors.The latter include VC firms (White Star Capital); music industry figures (Robbie Williams’ manager Tim Clarke and Metropolis Music founder Bob Angus); and the founders behind companies including Toptable, Deepmind, Secret Escapes and Voucher Codes.“Our investors are clever people: they’re not taking a punt on us without knowing we have ideas about the future,” says Hutcheon.“No booking fees might have initially been a bit of a headfuck, but it liberates your imagination about how we can generate ten times more money in the future. We have a lot of ideas that become possible once you remove all the friction between fans and artists.”Anything involving selling fans’ data will have to be handled carefully, but Dice may have opportunities to sell more things to fans: merchandise, for example, or perhaps even recordings of gigs – an ideatried (albeit unsuccessfully) in 2013 by another British startup, Soundhalo.ustwo’s close relationship with Apple – the companywon an Apple Design Award for Monument Valleyearlier this year – could also give it an early shot at integrating the newApple Paymobile payments technology when it eventually comes to the UK.That could open up more ways to make money – attendees paying for drinks, pre-gig meals, perhaps even their cab home – although Dice might have to figure out how to add comparable features on Android if it goes down this route.Still, Hutcheon is keen for Dice to be seen as more than just a technology startup. “Ultimately, it’s about humans,” he says. “As a manager, I couldn’t ever guarantee that fans would have the best experience. We’re trying to make that possible.”•Can Twickets dent ticket touting and secondary sales?•Songkick has 10m users and $100m in ticket revenue
Google has removed two links to a site hosting stolen nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence after requests by the actor’s lawyers.The takedown requests were filed under the digital millennium copyright act (DMCA), with her lawyers Mitchell Silberberg &amp; Knupp stating that the stolen photos impinged on Lawrence’s copyright.The DMCA, which governs the use of copyrighted material and is usually used in reference to pirated TV shows, films and music, requires sites to “expeditiously” remove unlawful images from their servers.The site removed from Google’s search results has since changed its domain, which has caused the site to be re-indexed by Google and reappear in search results under the different website address. The takedown notice did not list the new domain, requiring another request to be filed to remove it from the search results.The site hosting the photos targeted by Lawrence’s lawyers claims that it will take down the stolen photos if requested.Google under fireGoogle has come under pressure from lawyers representing various celebrities whose private photos were published by hackers.The top entertainment lawyer Martin Singerhas written to Googledemanding that the company pay for its “blatantly unethical behaviour”, threatening to sue the search giant for $100m.Singer’s Los Angeles-based firm Lavely &amp; Singer represents more than a dozen of the women affected, the director Bryan Singer and the actors John Travolta and Charlie Sheen.Lavely &amp; Singer has written to various website operators and internet service providers (ISPs) demanding that the images be taken down under the DMCA.Repeating its statement from early October, Google said: “We’ve removed tens of thousands of pictures – within hours of the requests being made – and we have closed hundreds of accounts. The internet is used for many good things. Stealing people’s private photos is not one of them.”•Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and others posted online by alleged hacker
A landmark Britishtest casehas opened the gates for brand owners to compel internet service providers (ISPs) to police trademark infringement at scale, in addition to their already controversial role in copyright enforcement.The case was brought by luxury brands in the Richemont/Cartier group, demanding that the UK’s five major ISPs – BSkyB, BT, EE, TalkTalk, and VirginMedia – block six websites sporting fake versions of their brands and selling counterfeit goods.Richemont stated that these were the first in a line-up of 239,000 potentially infringing sites.Global firstThe case, decided in the High Court of England &amp; Wales on Friday by Justice Richard Arnold, extends the remedy of ‘blocking injunctions’ - a favoured weapon of copyright enforcers - to trademarks for the first time.Unlike copyright, trademark law does not expressly provide for the issuing of blocking injunctions. To negotiate this jurisdictional hurdle, the judge relied on the general jurisdiction of the court and the European directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights.The directive provides for injunctions “against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right”. It also provides that such measures must be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive”.The six obscure websites at the centre of the case were not indexed, not searchable, and there was no proof of their access and use in the UK other than their names. They arecartierloveonline.com,iwcwatchtop.com,replicawatchesiwc.com,1iwc.com,montblancpensonlineuk.comandmontblancoutletonline.co.uk. There is no indication if the ruling will help prevent new, replica sites committing similar trademark infringement.“This case represents a positive step in the fight to protect brands and customers from the sale of counterfeit goods online,” said a spokesperson for Richemonte Cartier. “We are pleased by this judgment and welcome the Court’s recognition that there is a public interest in preventing trade mark infringement, particularly where counterfeit goods are involved.“The Courts had already granted orders requiring ISPs to block sites for infringement of copyright in relation to pirated content. This decision is a logical extension of that principle to trade marks.”Burdens and safeguardsThe ruling is unusual in that apart from providing an internet connection to consumers, ISPs otherwise have no connection or responsibility for counterfeit content.Controversially, the decision leaves ISPs responsible for all costs. Though the costs of blocking one website are minor, the attractiveness of this remedy to rightholders means that this is likely to have significant cumulative effect, placing a large burden on businesses that already suffer the heat of overzealous copyright enforcers and surveillance hoarders.Another contentious aspect of the decision is that the judge relied on the fact that ISPs had already innovated, under political pressure, to block child abuse images and institute parental controls, so had the infrastructure necessary to block counterfeit websites.The campaign organisation Open Rights Group made asuccessful interventionin the case to secure some modest safeguards, with the judge requiring that such orders be subject to sunset clauses of a provisional two years, as well as including adequate notifications on blocked sites.The Internet Service Providers Association has been contacted for comment.•Cartier launches legal attempt to prevent websites selling counterfeit goods
To collect butterflies, you need a net, pins and card. You catch the butterfly in the net, then you pin it to the card. Down in Silicon Valley, the nets are made, the butterflies stuck with red pins to cinema seats and coffee shops.By now, we’re so used to tracking location that it’s hard to image life without it. Putting a pin in your particular position in place and time is almost a prerequisite of modern life. In one day a person could feasibly use Citymapper to chart a route to Canary Wharf, use Tinder to fish for a nearby banker, go with them to a restaurant and pin the instagrammed meal to the exact moment they finished the cherry cheesecake.Apps earn their keep by drawing lines from your phone to the world around you. Whether lines through bus routes or into the lives of others, developers are addressing a desire for connection, not just to other humans but to the places we live.Cities, like butterflies, are chaotic things, and from Sherlock Holmes to Batman we’ve created heroes who can take that mess and put it in order, show us that it makes sense. Geolocation does a similar thing. It gives us rational, clear evidence of our place in the world and of our connection to others. We use it to draw lines to things around us and we choose to be pinned down because we want these lines to be made.When those lines are collected and tracked, that’s when the personal desire for connection comes up against ethical concerns of how such data should be handled.The whistleblowing app Whisper has beentracking the location of some of its users, the Guardian reported on Thursday, including some who have specifically asked not to be followed. Whisper’s chief technology officer, Chad DePue, responded by writing in Hacker News that Whisper only uses location data for general issues such as time-zone localisation, “so when we send pushes we know not to send pushes at three in the morning.”Commenting on this, the security researcher Moxie Marlinspike noted the important distinction between not being able to track users of the app and deciding not to do so: “There’s a huge difference between ‘can’t track’ and ‘won’t track’,” wrote Marlinspike. “Right now you’re claiming ‘can’t,’ but it sounds like you’re squarely in the ‘won’t’ category of having your servers ‘avert their eyes’. I think this understandably makes people uneasy, particularly given the data mining direction it sounds like the company is headed.”This uneasiness is becoming an all-too-familiar feeling. Stories of data being sourced from social networks and used by companies and governments are becoming uncomfortably commonplace. With the fear of data monitoring, are we shying away from shouting about where we are?No. Last year’s Pew Research Center’s Internet Project report found that among adult social media users aged 18 and older, 30% said that at least one of their accounts was set up to include their location in their posts, up from 14% who said they did this 2011. As location tracking becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, data mining becomes an ever more accurate option for measuring citizens and consumers. From targeting terrorist activity to targeted advertisements, the potential use of location data spans the chilling and the mundane.To confront this, the industry mindset towards location tracking needs to change. For those in Silicon Valley, developing apps which use location tracking isn’t necessary a sinister scheme; for many it’s simply a way to provide users with the services they increasingly expect to have in place.As has already been said, we want these lines to be drawn; we opt to be pinned. So strong is this desire to be situated in time and space and to share the position with others that the idea of tracking location has spread from a periphery feature to one which is required for most apps to function. Geolocation tracking has crept from the edges into the centre of software development and now that it has developers have an urgent ethical responsibility to address the way it is implemented.In Marlinspike’s comments to DePue, the security researcher underlined the problem of balancing privacy with app functionality: “How do you achieve anonymity and unlinkability while doing things like relevance matching?”When an app relies on sourcing personal data to function, how can this be squared off against the right to anonymity? It’s a crucial issue and one which, in the face of rapidly developing technology and the rush to create popular software, has been allowed to slip to the sidelines.If location services are here to stay, clearer principles are needed. In the face of growing transparency in our individual lives, Silicon Valley needs to become more transparent in how it handles data. The butterfly collector needs to show his net.•Whisper revelations: the facts
Microsoft will unveil a fitness band with smartwatch functions within the next few weeks,according to reports.The smartwatch will connect to a smartphone, such as Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows Phones, and display notifications and other data from the internet. It will also act as a fitness tracker, monitoring motion, activity and calories burned, using sensors.The key feature will be a heart-rate monitor that continuously tracks the wearer’s heart throughout the day. It will have a two-day battery life, while most smartwatches with similar capabilities can only last hours with continuous heart monitoring, or a day with intermittent testing.First wearable under the new bossPatents filed in 2012 andpublished in Mayshow that Microsoft has been working on a fitness smartwatch for the past couple of years, but the Spot smartwatch from 2004 was Microsoft’s first attempt at a wearable device.The Spot used FM radio to send the watch news, weather and other information, but was ahead of its time and failed to gain mass appeal.The new Microsoft smartwatch will be the first foray for the company into the expanding wearables market under the relatively new chief executive Satya Nadella.Samsung, Motorola, LG and Pebble, among others, have launched smartwatch devices within the past year, despite wearablesstruggling to gain mass adoptionandbeing discarded within a yearby users.

Snapchat reportedly has more than 100 million active users of its free photo and video messaging app, but it has never made any money from them. Now it’s hoping to change that by running adverts within the app.The first one appeared inside the app’s Recent Updates screen for American users over the weekend: a 20-second trailer for horror film Ouija, paid for by studio Universal Pictures.“It’s the first time we’ve done anything like this because it’s the first time we’ve been paid to put content in that space. It’s going to feel a little weird at first, but we’re taking the plunge,”explained Snapchat in a blog postpublished before the ad launched.The subject matter may have been scary, but Snapchat was at pains to tell its users that it wants to steer away from “creepy” ad-targeting, as well as avoiding being too intrusive with advertising.“The best advertisements tell you more about stuff that actually interests you. Some companies spend a lot of time and collect a lot of data about you to figure that out. The product we’re releasing today is a lot simpler. An advertisement will appear in your Recent Updates from time to time, and you can choose if you want to watch it. No biggie. It goes away after you view it or within 24 hours, just like Stories.We won’t put advertisements in your personal communication – things like Snaps or Chats. That would be totally rude. We want to see if we can deliver an experience that’s fun and informative, the way ads used to be, before they got creepy and targeted. It’s nice when all of the brilliant creative minds out there get our attention with terrific content.”Neither Snapchat nor Universal said how much the latter is paying for the ad, although Universal’s executive vice president of marketing Doug Neiltold AdAgewhy the studio was keen to advertise within Snapchat.“We like to select media platforms that are appropriate for our audience. We’ve been closely following Snapchat and its adoption. It seems to be right in the core of our target audience for the movie Ouija,” he said.“I think Snapchat has been talking to all the studios and entertainment companies and brands for a long time. They just haven’t had opportunities previously. We’ve been having conversations with them for a while and just waiting for when would be the right opportunity.”In December 2013,Snapchat poached Emily White, the executive responsible for bringing adverts to Instagram, to become its chief operating officer.Neil added that Snapchat had specifically requested a video ad, and said that Sony had edited the trailer to fit in with the app by “using small video bursts the way a Snapchat Story would have been created”.Snapchat has been growing fast in the last couple of years, with the Wall Street Journal reporting in August thatSnapchat had more than 100m monthly active users, with around two thirds of them using it every day.The company wasvalued at $10bn in its last funding round, despite its lack of revenues. It famouslyturned down a $3bn acquisition offer from Facebookin 2013 in favour of remaining independent.Snapchat’s appeal to internet giant and brands alike is its popularity among teenagers and twentysomethings. In August, research firm comScore claimed that32.9% of 18-34 year-olds in the US were using the app, but this was closer to 50% for 18-24 year-olds.Snapchat has sparked several controversies as it has grown, however. In September, itsettled a long-running lawsuit from co-founder Reggie Brown, who had alleged he had been squeezed out of the company without appropriate credit or compensation by chief executive Evan Spiegel and chief technology officer Bobby Murphy.More recently, a hack dubbed“The Snappening”saw tens of thousands of private Snapchat photos leaked, although the company said thatthe fault lay with an unsupported third-party service, SnapSaved, that promised to allow users to save pictures sent to them using Snapchat.•Ten things you need to know about Snapchat
Streaming music service Spotify is launching anew “Family” planthat will offer cheaper subscriptions to its paying users’ family members.Subscribers will be able to add up to four family members to their account, with each paying half the price of a standard subscription: so £4.99 in the UK.Each family member will have their own account on Spotify to create and follow playlists and musicians, as well as signing in to Facebook to follow friends.Spotify’s chief content officer Ken Parks said that a family plan was “one of the most asked for features from our audience”, although the company is not the first streaming service to introduce it.RivalRdio launched similar family plansin August 2011 for up to three family members, beforeexpanding the total to fivein June 2013. It charges £17.99 a month in the UK for two unlimited subscriptions, then £5 each for a third, fourth or fifth family member.In the US, Beats Music launched in January 2014 with a partnership with telco AT&amp;T, charging a flat $14.99 a month for up to five people on 10 devices to use its service.The deal finished in October, however, and has now been removed from AT&amp;T’s website.These kinds of deals can be appealing for families, particularly parents who are concerned that their children might be downloading music illegally – although in truth, in 2014, they’re more likely to be streaming their music from YouTube.For Spotify and its rivals, family plans are potentially a way to add more premium subscribers who, even after the 50% discount, boost these companies’ revenues much more than users of their free, advertising-supported versions do.In May 2014,Spotify said that it had 40m active usersincluding 10m paying subscribers. It has not updated those figures since, but according to music label sources, the company has since passed the 50m active users milestone.Spotify declined to comment on the claim, but told the Guardian that the new family plan will launch in the UK in the next few weeks.The UK is one of the company’s biggest markets:Spotify’s British subsidiary saw its revenues rise 41.8% to £131.4m in 2013, helping it post a net profit of £2.6m that year.It has benefited from wider growth in streaming music in the UK, with industry body the BPI recently saying thatthe number of tracks streamed in the UK has nearly doubledyear-on-year in 2014 so far, with Spotify and its rivals now streaming 300m songs a week.•Five challenges looming for Spotify and streaming music•Spotify vs musicians: 10 things to read to understand the debate•Streaming music: what next for Apple, YouTube and Spotify?
Google is preparing a new tweak to its search engine to ensure that some of the most ‘notorious’ piracy sites are less likely to appear when people search for music, films and other copyrighted content.Aprevious promise to do this in 2012has since proved controversial, with music and movie industry bodies regularly claiming Google did not follow through on that promise. This time round, Google says the results will be noticeable.“In August 2012 we first announced that we would downrank sites for which we received a large number of valid DMCA notices,” wrote Google’s senior copyright counsel Katherine Oyama in a blog post published on Friday (17 October).“We’ve now refined the signal in ways we expect to visibly affect the rankings of some of the most notorious sites. This update will roll out globally starting next week.”Oyama did not give details on which sites are being demoted, or by how much their demotions will affect their rankings – the attribute that determines how close to the top of its results a site appears when people search for relevant keywords.Her announcement was made as Google published a new version of itsHow Google Fights Piracy report, which was originally launched in September 2013 as a defence against claims by music and film rightsholders that Google was not doing enough on this front.Oyama also said that Google has been testing new ad formats that show links to legal digital music and video services when people search using keywords including download, free and watch; and removing terms from its autocomplete feature if they “return results with many DMCA demoted sites”.Google is testing new ad formats to promote legal services.DMCA notices are the key to much of this: they’re the takedown requests sent by rightsholders (or anti-piracy companies acting on their behalf) to Google alerting it to links that lead to what they believe are infringing downloads or streams.“In 2013 we received just over 224 million DMCA requests for Google search results,” explains the updated report, which claims that the average time taken to deal with these requests is less than six hours.“We ultimately removed 222M, which means we rejected or reinstated less than 1% after review because we either needed additional information, were unable to find the page, or concluded that the material was not infringing.”That’s individual links, but the latest change to Google’s search algorithm will focus on entire websites.A guide to those most likely to be affected can be found onGoogle’s online transparency report, which ranks sites by the number of takedowns it has received: RapidGator, 4Shared and Dilandau are the top three in the last year, with more than 7m DMCA notices each.British music industry body the BPI was the most prolific takedown-sender in 2013, with 43.3m notices. Its chief executive Geoff Taylor has regularly criticised Google for not doing more to tackle piracy, but he welcomed the announcement.“When fans search for music or films, they should get legal results – it’s as simple as that,” said Taylor in a statement that added he was “encouraged” by Google’s latest action.“If these new steps help guide more consumers to services like Spotify, Deezer and iTunes, which give back to music, instead of to fraudulent torrent or hosting sites, then they would represent a step forward for artists, labels and all those trying to build a thriving music economy online.”However, the BPI would like to see rival search engines Bing and Yahoo follow suit, while also pressing for Google to delist entirely sites that have been “ruled illegal by the courts”, and to be faster at removing “pirate apps” from Android’s Google Play store.The delisting request refers to sites that have been blocked by ISPs in the UK after the BPI secured high court orders:The Pirate Bayin 2012,Kickass Torrents, H33T and Fenopyin February 2013, andanother 21 sitesin October 2013.Google may push back against pressure to delist sites from its search engine, however.“Even for the websites that have received the highest numbers of notices, the number of noticed pages is typically only a tiny fraction of the total number of pages on the site,” claims its updated report. “It would be inappropriate to remove entire sites under these circumstances.”•Why is the music industry so cross with Google?
A burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamHow big data is unfair &gt;&gt; MediumMoritz Hardt on the limits of "big data":Ironically, Gilian Tett is well known for reporting on the failure of such things as "multi-variable equations" in the wake of the financial crisis, but she is perplexingly quick to accept that multi-variable equations are neutral and therefore fair, because the "computer experts" (whatever that means) at the police station asserted them to be so.My goal is not to belabor this one example. Instead I'd like to refute the claim that "machine learning is fair by default". I don't mean to suggest that machine learning is inevitably unfair, but rather that there are powerful forces that can render decision making that depends on learning algorithms unfair. Any claim of fair decision making that does not address the technical issues that I'm about to discuss should strike you as dubious.10 immutable laws of security &gt;&gt; MicrosoftHere at the Microsoft Security Response Center, we investigate thousands of security reports every year. In some cases, we find that a report describes a bona fide security vulnerability resulting from a flaw in one of our products; when this happens, we develop a patch as quickly as possible to correct the error. (See "A Tour of the Microsoft Security Response Center"). In other cases, the reported problems simply result from a mistake someone made in using the product. But many fall in between. They discuss real security problems, but the problems don't result from product flaws. Over the years, we've developed a list of issues like these, that we call the 10 Immutable Laws of Security.Not new, but no less true.How one boy with autism became BFFs with Apple's Siri &gt;&gt; NYTimes.comJudith Newman:I asked [William] Mark [vp for information and computing sciences at SRI, which began Siri] if he knew whether any of the people who worked on Siri's language development at Apple were on the spectrum. "Well, of course, I don't know for certain," he said, thoughtfully. "But, when you think about it, you've just described half of Silicon Valley."Of all the worries the parent of an autistic child has, the uppermost is: Will he find love? Or even companionship? Somewhere along the line, I am learning that what gives my guy happiness is not necessarily the same as what gives me happiness. Right now, at his age, a time when humans can be a little overwhelming even for the average teenager, Siri makes Gus happy. She is his sidekick. Last night, as he was going to bed, there was this matter-of-fact exchange:Gus: "Siri, will you marry me?"PhotoSiri: "I'm not the marrying kind."Gus: "I mean, not now. I'm a kid. I mean when I'm grown up."Siri: "My end user agreement does not include marriage."Gus: "Oh, OK."It's both heartwarming and intriguing.Windows Feature Suggestions: Top (1449 ideas) – Feature Suggestions for Windows &gt;&gt; UservoiceUservoice is a service where people can vote for wanted features.

As was fully expected, Google has nowasked the Supreme Court to hear an appealon the case. Google'spetitionis a good read highlighting the "disarray" in the various different circuits about whether or not copyright law applies to APIs. The law itself (Section 102(b)) is pretty explicit: "In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work." Many of us clearly think that APIs fit under this as a system or method of operation. But, others disagree.These are the embers of Oracle's lawsuit against Google claiming that Android infringed both patent and copyright. The patent side fizzled; now Oracle needs a result on API copyrightability. If it gets it, the case would come back to life.Microsoft withdraws another buggy update &gt;&gt; ZDNetMicrosoft has withdrawn an update released this past Tuesday due touser reports of system rebootsafter installation.The update released as described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2949927 added SHA-2 hash algorithm signing and verification for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.

The original 27" iMac's groundbreaking LCD panel wasn't available in an external display from Apple for almost a year after its release. But that's not the biggest problem.Pushing this many pixels requires more bandwidth than DisplayPort 1.2 offers, which is what Thunderbolt 2 ports use for outputting video signals. (I wrote about this a few times.) Doing it right will require waiting until DisplayPort 1.3 in Thunderbolt 3 on Broadwell's successor, Skylake, which isn't supposed to come out for at least another year — and Intel is even worse at estimating ship dates than I am, so it's likely to be longer.Dell is about to offer a 5K display - at the same price as the iMac.The Spotify payments fracas &gt;&gt; Lefsetz LetterBob Lefsetz is a highly respected voice in the music industry:Streaming won.

The program would aim to make Android software seem more consistent across smartphones from different manufacturers.This would mean Android phone makers wouldn't be able to customize the software on their phones as much as they do today, and Google's Android partners don't seem to be on board with that idea.Android Silver has reportedly been "shelved,"Re/code's Ina Fried reports, mainly because device makers didn't want to use such a restricted version of Android on their new phones. They also didn't want to scale back their own branding and share it with another company, according to Fried.Android OEMs don't want to give up the chance of differentiation - which is what gives them brand loyalty, and profits.You can followGuardian Technology's linkbucket on PinboardTo suggest a link, either add it below or tag it with @gdntech on the freeDeliciousservice.
Sir Christopher Wren would have celebrated his 382nd birthday today, had he lived to such a ripe old age, and Google has created a Doodle to mark the occasion. Clicking on the illustration triggers a short animation depicting a stylised rise of Wren’s St Paul’s Cathedral, construction of which began in 1675. It opened in 1708.Born as the son of the Dean of Windsor in East Knoyle, Wiltshire in 1632, Wren showed an early talent for mathematics and was appointed professor of astronomy at Gresham College in London in 1657 before taking the same role at Oxford University four years later.He was one of the founding members of the Royal Society in 1662, and three years later visited Paris, where he was strongly influenced by French and Italian baroque styles. Following the Great Fire in 1666, he designed 51 new churches for the capital in addition to St Paul’s.Wren was knighted in 1673 and two years later was commissioned to design the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. He was also responsible for the facade of Hampton Court Palace.He lived a remarkably long life for the time, dying in 1723 at the age of 91.
Doctor Who’s latest adventure sees him teaming up with a Dalek and trying to save the universe, but also teaching children some early computer programming skills.This isn’t a TV show, however: it’s a game due to launch on Wednesday 22 October on the broadcaster’s CBBC website. The Doctor and the Dalek includes voice narration from current Doctor Peter Capaldi, and a new story by Phil Ford, who has written for the TV show.The free web game is aimed at 6-12 year-olds, and involves freeing a battered Dalek from a ship of Cybermen, then building it back up to full strength through puzzles based on the programming elements of the new English computing curriculum.Children will be combining instructions to accomplish a given goal, using variables to alter behaviour, exploring repetition and loops, and using their logical reasoning skills in order to rebuild the Dalek.Ford’s story is set on the Sontar homeworld, which the BBC says has never been shown on-screen before, although many Doctor Who fans will be familiar with its aggressive inhabitants, the Sontarans. The action will also take players to the Cyber-tombs of Telos, last seen in a 1985 episode of the drama.Jo Pearce, creative director of BBC Doctor Who Interactive, told The Guardian that Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat and executive producer Bryan Minchin were both involved in the approval process for the game. “It is part of the Doctor Who world: we don’t differentiate it,” she said.The BBC has also created material for parents and teachers to accompany the game, which also tie in to the new computing curriculum in England.“This touches predominantly on key stage two, but then goes in to key stage three. We wanted the game to be something that could help teachers in the classroom as well,” said Pearce. “Teachers are getting their heads around this new curriculum, so it was a big aim for us to do these teaching packs.”The project was the work of BBC Wales and creative agency Somethin’ Else, working with BBC Future Media to a commission from the broadcaster’s BBC Learning division.“Getting children inspired is the big thing for us around this game. When you say ‘coding and programming’ straight away it feels like a very dry topic, but our aim was to show children you can have fun,” said Pearce, ahead of the game’s launch.“When we put the game out to tender, we wanted it to be the best Dalek game there can be. It has to be addictive and fun, and the learning elements are core to that.”The Doctor and the Dalek’s puzzles are based on the new computing curriculum in England. Image: BBCPhotograph: BBCThe game also aims to be a spur for children to investigate the kind of programming tools they might be using at school, rather than competing with them.“Because there are excellent platforms like Scratch and Blockly out there, we didn’t want to do any duplication,” said Rich Jenkins, development producer at Doctor Who Interactive. “We talked to teachers and kids, and they were looking for that first step to demystify programming and not make it feel difficult.”The project included input from Dr Tom Crick, senior lecturer in computing science at Cardiff Metropolitan University and chair of the Computing At Schools body in Wales, and Rik Cross, head of education for Code Club.“We have taken the learning element very seriously so were really keen to get the right people involved who had that level of authority,” said Pearce. “We want this to be the first step to inspire children into coding, and to gradually take them on to more academic tools like Scratch.”“This stuff is quite new to the curriculum: some schools have only just started, while others have been doing it for a while. So you get some 10 year-olds who know how to code their own games, and others who don’t know anything,” added Jenkins.“The game starts at that [latter] level of ability and gradually increases the coding learning. Kids start off on simple sequencing, but by the final chapter they’ll get into things like Boolean logic and quite complex procedures.”For now, the game is only playable on computers, but the development team is working on future updates that will make it work on tablets too, likely by early 2015.Children power up the Dalek to help it survive in the main platform game. Screenshot: BBCPhotograph: BBCThe Doctor and the Dalek is part of a wider project at the BBC called Make it Digital, which will be the broadcaster’s big educational initiative in 2015, following on from its focus on the first world war in 2014.Besides the new Doctor Who game, the corporation has alreadylaunched a series of “Bitesize” guidestied to the new computing curriculum, and revealed plans for new showsAppsolute Genius, Technobabble and Nina and the Neurons: Go Digitalon its CBBC and CBeebies children’s TV channels.“Tony Hall, the Director-General, said that in 2015 he wanted to get a new generation to get creative with coding,” Jessica Cecil, the BBC’s controller for Make it Digital, told The Guardian.“We’ve gone away and thought ‘what can the BBC do in an area where there are some incredible initiatives already?’ The first is to inspire, because what we do best is tell stories. Secondly, we can attempt to shine a spotlight on the wonderful world of what people are doing with technology.”Cecil’s colleague, head of strategic delivery Kerensa Jennings, stressed that the BBC’s efforts will not just focus on programming skills.“This is about have-a-go digital literacy: making, creating. It’s not all just about programming: it might be having a go at a robotics challenge, or 3D printing, or experimenting with digital design or animation,” she said.“We’ll also be taking an unplugged approach in the real world, helping people to feel inspired around computational thinking even when they’re nowhere near a computer.”•Coding at school: guide to the new computing curriculum•‘Great big poo balls!’ Making a Kano computer with your kids•Kids programming at school: ‘You’re thinking about thinking’

Much of the hype about any Apple launch is bound to surround the new hardware, and the introduction of iPhone 6 and giant-size 6 Plus was no different. However, it’s the rollout of iOS 8 that will affect most people. There’s no great revolution with this free update, but the way it allows third-party software to integrate with the built-in apps is a big improvement.Swiftkey(iOS, free)has long been an Android favourite, but now arrives on Apple devices, allowing typing in multiple languages as it learns your style – and most importantly allows swipe-typing – so that you need never lift your finger from the screen.The improvement to the camera is noticeable especially in the Plus, and Apple has done a good job of improving on-the-fly editing, but the integration of apps such asLitely(iOS, free), which provides subtle and effective photo editing, is welcome.Halftone 2(Juicy Bits, iOS, £1.49) allows you to turn photos into comic books with ease.The other great step forward is the way apps can appear as widgets in the notification centre.Transit(Tapone, iOS, free) offers nearest stations and due time for transport – as well as helping with directions in the main app – while the ever-reliableYahoo Weather(iOS, free) is allowed to sit front and centre. And that’s the great step forward – the tools you want made more accessible than ever.
The 10th game in Frogwares’ series of Sherlock Holmes adventure games,Crime &amp; Punishmentsis technically ambitious, adopting Unreal Engine 3 for the best-looking instalment yet. Gameplay is thoroughly old school, though, an unapologetic point and click in approach, if not execution. Played in third- or first-person,Crimes &amp; Punishmentsallows you to investigate murders and disappearances across Victorian London, using Holmes’s keen intuition to piece together seemingly arbitrary clues.Interrogation of suspects adds anLA Noirevibe, pulling apart inconsistencies in stories, while costume changes help Holmes go undercover to hunt down information.Unexpectedly good writing and (mostly) solid voice acting keep the attention, but ultimately the game is unpolished. Holmes’s walk animation is ropey and crime scenes are reduced to looking at everything before moving on. That said,Crimes &amp; Punishmentsis oddly compelling once you’ve allowed yourself to be drawn into its narrative.
Price £37,705MPG 37.7Top speed 126mphWhite mischief: Jeep’s new Grand CherokeePhotograph: PRAn ancient woman, bent over two sticks, shuffles up to me in the pretty market square of St-Fort-sur-Gironde, where we are on holiday. “Monsieur, cette voiture est grosse,” she croaks, indicating the giantJeep Grand Cherokeenext to me. She hasn’t a tooth in her head and, though she seems to be smiling, I’m not sure she is. Maybe she thinks it isgross? I bluff it out: “Oui,” I say in fluent schoolboy-ese. “C’est énorme… comme un éléphant.” I’m very pleased with this, but all I get is more gum and a sour look. She shuffles off, leaving me feeling a little self-conscious.But that’s how I’ve been feeling all week. Compared to the rickety Renaults and crabby Citroëns puttering around these quiet roads, this mighty Jeep has felt rudely, almost defiantly healthy – like a buffed bodybuilder strutting past a bunch of anaemic goths. With its military-grade wheels, glinting seven-bar grille and imperious sneer, it’s been a tank parked on France’s prettiest lawns.On the plus side, it made mincemeat of the day-long drive slicing down France from top to bottom. The Jeep may have been designed for giving Mother Nature a good thrashing, but on France’s long A-roads, the SUV was a revelation. A host of driver aids meant I could flick on the adaptive cruise control and let the car take the strain. At one point the laser-activated speed system allowed me to cover more than 100 miles without touching either the brake or the throttle. The only problem was that half of Britain also seemed to be on the road. The French radio bleated the traffic news with worrying words like “embouteillage” and “malheureusement” jumping out at us. In the end we drove 650 miles in 12 hours, doing 30.1 miles to the gallon at an average speed of 54mph. Long journeys always turn me into a stats geek.Inside story: the comfortable interior – perfect for long journeys.The Grand Cherokee has been in production for 21 years and this is an update of the fourth-generation model. It now boasts an incredibly generous standard kit list and a slightly cleaner and leaner diesel engine. Climb inside and the Jeep has a functional layout that’s very easy to live with. There are silvery finishes to buttons and dials, and leather seats that wouldn’t be out of place in a gentlemen’s club. The dashboard is now digital and you can choose the info you want to display – for instance switching the speedo to kph when in France. Although, worryingly, the satnav still seemed to think we were in the UK and kept telling me to go the wrong way at roundabouts.Jeeps have a proud offroad heritage and there’s a rotary dial to adjust the suspension according to the terrain you encounter: the Selec-Terrain offers a choice of auto, snow, sport, sand/mud and rock. There’s an all-new eight-speed ZF automatic gearbox to replace the clunkier five-speed box and changes now are pretty slick and smooth. The posher models also come with air-suspension so the ride matches the velvety gear change.There are a couple of niggles. There are few storage cubbies up front and the door pockets are so narrow you skin your knuckles trying to retrieve yourpéagetickets. There is no left foot rest – irritating in an automatic. And the foot-operated parking brake rubs the side of your shin (a small detail, but these little things build up when you’re in the car for 12 hours straight).One sweet touch that caught my eye was the tiny image of an original 1945 Willys Jeep hidden in the lens of the front lights. Jeep really has covered a lot of miles since then…Put Britain back in the driving seatLorries on the A2 in Kent.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PABritain desperately needs morelorry drivers. It has been publicised recently that the UK logistics industry is facing a major skills gap, leaving an estimated 30,000 driver vacancies to be filled. Although there are 285,000 HGV drivers in the UK, there are now more Polish registered vehicles going to mainland Europe from the UK, than there are UK registered vehicles. And yet, there are thousands of HGV driver jobs being advertised in the UK. Becoming an HGV driver is a fairly straightforward process and HGV training is available at locations across the UK. So, for those looking for work or fancying a career change, why not fill one of these vacancies and help the industry put the UK back in the driver’s seat.Keeping cyclists safeThe evolution of cycling.The RAC has just launched a new scheme offeringPersonal Accident Insurancecover for cyclists.

Many moons ago, shortly after Edward Snowden’s revelations about the NSA first appeared, I wrote a column which began, “Repeat after me: Edward Snowden is not the story”. I was infuriated by the way the mainstream media was focusing not on the import of what he had revealed, but on the trivia: Snowden’s personality, facial hair (or absence thereof), whereabouts, family background, girlfriend, etc. The usual crap, in other words. It was like having a chap tell us that the government was poisoning the water supply and concentrating instead on whom he had friended on Facebook.Mercifully, we have moved on a bit since then. The important thing now, it seems to me, is to consider a new question: given what we now know, what should we do about it? Whatcouldwe realistically do? Will we, in fact, do anything? And if the latter, where are we heading as democracies?I tried to put some of these questions to Snowden at theObserverIdeas festival last Sundayvia a Skype link that proved comically dysfunctional. The comedy in using a technology to which the NSA has a backdoor was not lost on the (large) audience — or on Snowden, who coped gracefully with it. But it was a bit like trying to have a philosophical discussion using smoke signals. So let’s have another go.First, what could we do to curb comprehensive surveillance of the net? The internet engineering community seems determined to do something about it. In its current form, the network is wide open to snooping, because most of its operations are not encrypted. At theVancouver 2013 meeting of the Internet Engineering Task Forcethere were discussions about ways of inserting so much cryptographic treacle into the network’s operations that the NSA would have to work much harder to surveil it, thereby forcing snoopers to adopt more targeted approaches that would be amenable to credible legal oversight. This won’t be easy to do, but there’s enough technical ingenuity in the community to pull it off.Even if they did, however, that wouldn’t be the end of the matter, because lots of unsavoury things go on in cyberspace, and it would be unthinkable not to allow access to communications for law enforcement and national security purposes. Which means that democracies need oversight regimes that are effective, technically competent and enjoy public trust. The fallout from Snowden suggests that the oversight regimes in most democracies currently lack some or all of these properties. Fixing that requires political action, and therein lies our biggest problem.The most depressing thing about the political response to the revelations is how crass and simplistic they have been. First we had the yah-boo phase: Snowden was a traitor; the revelations dramatically undermined “national security”; anyone who applauds what he did is a naive idiot; if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear, etc. These are the philosophical equivalent of the debates that go on in bars after Premier League matches.The good news is that we have moved on a bit from such inanities. The political debate is now framed in terms of a “balance” to be struck between security and privacy, as if it were a matter of piling fruit on both sides of weighing scales and seeing which way the needle points. But security and privacy are very different concepts. Security is a function of two things: the scale of a possible harm and the probability that it will happen. Some possible dangers are so great that even if their probability is low then extreme measures are justified. Other potential harms are smaller but more probable. In thinking about surveillance and counter-terrorism we need some way of reaching collectively agreed judgments about how the “balance” should be struck.Likewise privacy has a value for both individuals and for society as a whole; it is also culturally and domain-dependent (we have different expectations of privacy in different locations). And the standard official line on privacy at the moment – that “people obviously don’t care much about it, otherwise they wouldn’t be on Facebook” – won’t wash, because people give their consent to Facebook, whereas none of us clicked “agree” to the hoovering up of our communications data.Finally, there’s the question that is never discussed. Is this bulk surveillance actually effective? Is there credible evidence – as distinct from bland assurances by officials – that it actually works? Why, despite all the snooping, for example, did our intelligence services not pick up the Islamic State threat? Andhow cost-effective is it? The US currently spends over $100bn a year on counter-terrorism. God alone knows how much the UK spends. Are we getting real value for all this taxpayers’ money? I’d like to know. Wouldn’t you?
When the developer Creative Assembly promised a return to the brooding horror of 1979’s Alien for this latest video game tie-in, it left fans eager to see how such a tone would translate to a modern, big-budget title. For the most part, the results are thrilling.This is a taut, nerve-jangling experience that makes outstanding use of sound and lighting to maintain an atmosphere of impending doom. You play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of series stalwart Ellen, searching a decommissioned space station for clues as to what happened to your mother in the original film. Something otherworldly is also on board, wreaking violent havoc.Initially, foes are terrified humans or malfunctioning androids. But when the eponymous alien finally reveals itself, the wait is justified: the creature is fantastically well realised, a creeping, slick horror that cannot be stopped, merely avoided. It’s a refreshing angle for a tent-pole title and undeniably terrifying while it lasts.What weaknesses there are revolve around slightly underwhelming characters and occasionally invasive cut scenes. Some of the later story beats may also prove divisive, though in the context of the wider franchise they make sense. All told, though, this is a close encounter you won’t forget quickly.

Digital animals, construction drones and furniture that is smart in all senses of the word are among the innovations that could soon be heading into, under and above our homes, roboticists revealed last week.Speaking atRe.Work’s the Future of Robotics forumin London, experts from academia, industry and the startup scene came together to unveil the latest innovations from their labs, share their experiences and discuss the challenges of turning prototypes into viable products. “Robotics investment is really on the increase at the moment,” said Nikita Johnson, founder of Re.work.But while robotics groups across the UK are bristling with good ideas, she believes we are lagging behind when it comes to commercialisation. “Where we need to catch up on is really making sure that that [work from universities] gets to market and thinking about how we can try and integrate that into industry so that it does have an impact and it’s not just left in the lab.”Among those aiming to bridge this gap is Sebastian Conran, designer in residence at the University of Sheffield. Working with researchers including Professor Tony Prescott, director of the Sheffield Centre for Robotics, Conran has been involved in pioneering solutions for the household, from robotic companions to “smart” furniture that can assist elderly or ill people. “Robotics is the new rock’n’roll,” he says. “It’s about finding compelling uses for it.”DRONESA 3D-printing drone.Photograph: ObserverWhile drones might evoke images of huge military unmanned aerial vehicles, researchers point out that they can also provide solutions to numerous civilian conundrums, from fixing a roof to taking the perfect selfie or even monitoring pollution levels. Currently on display at the Science Museum, London, is a 3D-printing drone created by Dr Mirko Kovac from Imperial College London that can extrude a foam material while on the wing.His biological model for the device was swiftlets, birds that knock up a nest using their saliva. Kovac believes such drones could be useful in repairing inaccessible, damaged regions of the home or other structures. But he is confident there is more to learn from the natural world, including ways of increasing observation time for sensing drones without the need for greater energy.ROBO-PETSRobo-pets mimic real animals.Photograph: Gelsomina Esposito/ObserverMove over Tamgotchi, a new digital pet is about to roll into town. This cutesy robot, set to be launched nationwide next spring, boasts the ability to respond to voices, recognise objects and even take itself to a charging station when zonked. Under development by a team that encompasses Eaglemoss publications, Conran and robotics experts including Prescott and Dr Ben Mitchinson from the University of Sheffield, the bot – it is claimed – mimics a real animal.“The control systems inside the robot are modelled on what we think mammalian brains are doing,” says Prescott. The aim is that you’ll be able to train your new companion. “It will be learning according to the same principles – stimulus response learning, or reinforcement learning – that animals can do,” he adds.You robo-pet will be fitted with cameras and microphones; you can keep tabs on what it can see and hear via an app on your tablet or smartphone. But rather than arriving as a readymade bundle of robotic joy, it will be available as a magazine-based build-it-yourself kit.Q-BOTQ-Bot will map and survey a building.Photograph: ObserverSeeking to take the grunt work out of the construction industry, q-bot is a new company on the block, deploying compact, sturdy robots to apply underfloor insulation, removing the need to pull up floorboards and install cut-to-fit panels.“A quarter of the UK’s properties are more than 100 years old and the vast majority, 7 million of them, have got suspended timber floors which just allow cold air to come up,” says Mathew Holloway, managing director of the company, which is now offering the service commercially.When introduced into the bowels of a building, the robot maps and surveys the area, providing insights into what lies beneath, before using the data to systematically spray insulating material to the underside of flooring.It can then record the depth of the insulation applied. The benefits? Toasty toes, fewer draughts and lower bills – without the need for a huge upheaval.MOTIMoti is a robotic ball designed to help autistic children.Photograph: ObserverRecently crowned grand winner of the inaugural Robot Launch startup competition, Moti is a robotic ball designed and created by fledgling company Leka, and is aimed at the healthcare sector. With robotics groups worldwide exploring the potential of robot-assisted therapy for children with autism – including Kaspar, a lifelike doll created at the University of Hertfordshire to help children with autism to understand emotions and facial expressions – the Leka team have developed a programmable plastic sphere that can change colours, move and respond to users.They believe their interactive tool will be able to help autistic children to communicate and socialise. Prototypes are expected to boast more sensors, collect data and play music; the team are hoping to make Moti commercially available by 2016.MECHA MONSTERSA gaming robot from Reach Robotics.Photograph: ObserverRobot wars could be coming to a living room near you, thanks to Reach Robotics’ gaming robots: Mecha monsters. Controlled by an app on a tablet or smartphone, users can “fight” their robots with pre-programmed moves and use developer software to create new actions. “In the industry at the moment, the products you get are either very simple products that kids are bored with – and adults are bored with – in a week’s time or really complex products that once you have programmed it’s something you can’t really do much more with,” says Silas Adekunle, founder of the startup company.“We want to create something that allows you to have fun and also has an opportunity to educate.”Due to be launched for pre-order on crowdfunding site Indigogo next month, the first Mecha monsters are expected to ship in time for Christmas next year.SMART FURNITUREAnother innovation from the fruitful collaboration that includes Prescott and Conran is smart furniture that appears to blend in rather than stand out. Currently under development is a smartphone-controlled cantilevered table that can navigate around the home or hospital to transport items, as well as adjust its height and tilt. With a tablet or iPad hooked up, users can talk to friends, family and healthcare providers face to face, as well as make use of voice and gesture control.But Conran believes its uses could be manifold: “With a bit of modification, so people don’t pinch your champagne, you could see it in room service,” he says.
Bayonetta is an icy-hearted, effortlessly stylish heroine of whose buttocks you’ll be treated to lingering shots as she performs special moves, which flow together into a hyper-violent ballet. Her job of saving the world from destruction by mythical beasts uses fists, feet, swords and guns, two of which fire directly from the heels of her boots. It’s the apotheosis of games such as Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, the action managing to make you feel powerful and elegant, its chaos of overwrought, screen-filling attacks punctuated by moments of slow-motion “witch time” that let you string together even more psychedelically lethal combos. However, it’s only when you progress from joyous button-mashing to deliberate tactics that you discover its combat system’s extraordinary depth. Foul-mouthed, deviant and violent, it’s all the things Nintendo isn’t, which makes it a pleasantly surprising Wii U exclusive.ALSO OUT THIS WEEKSkylanders: Trap Team, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS3, PS4, Wii &amp; Wii UCheerful, colourful and infused with a gentle sense of humour, Skylanders: Trap Team won’t tax you much if you play games regularly, which for its intended audience of small children is about right. As before, you put Skylander figures on a plastic disc – AKA the Traptanium Portal – to make them appear in the game. This time there’s a slot in the portal for traps, which let you suck up defeated baddies and play as them in future battles. The catch is that traps only capture specific varieties of monster, and you’ll also need a broad range of Skylanders to unlock the game’s many gated secret areas. You can use figures from previous iterations of the game, which retain all the powers you’ve earned for them, but you still need skills held only by the new Trap Masters. Its super-premium production values, charming script and genuine sense of adventure will help offset the irritation of parents being pestered for more addictively collectible Trap Masters and their slightly less expensive sidekicks.Activision, £46-£59

‘I was just staring at this fence, thinking, ‘You mustn’t crash into the fence, Katy.’ Then I basically accelerated.” Katy Brand is sitting in the passenger seat of ourCitroën C4 Cactus, recalling the intensive moped course she had to take for a recent role.“I’d never been on a moped before,” she says. “I felt vulnerable, and dangerous – to myself and to anyone near me. And I had what the instructor called ‘target fixation’. Which I think is just a nice way of saying, you’re really crap at riding a moped.”Today we are rolling along the country lanes of Hampshire, close to Brand’s home. She drives a Citroën, too – aC3that, unlike the Cactus, “has two drinks holders that actually fit drinks” (this one’s don’t).Nor does her Citroën suffer from the peculiar armrest next to the driver’s seat, which, when folded down, makes it virtually impossible for anyone with arms to change gear.Still, the Cactus is a pleasant drive. It’s a little perplexed by the windy roads, and calls for plenty of gear changes, but deals well with bumps, leaf mulch and the occasional need to brake fiercely when a pheasant runs into the road.“I like very loud hip-hop to drive to,” Brand tells me, incongruously, as we drive past a row of thatched cottages. “The only problem with driving to hip-hop is that you do end up driving a lot faster.” I can picture her, I say, zooming through her idyllic village, blaring outJay Z. “Yes,” she nods. “Speeding past the duck pond, waving to the vicar.”I feel similarly discordant driving the Cactus in the countryside, largely because its design – a dimpled strip down each side – makes it look faintly like a giant sports shoe. It even gets puzzled looks in the city, when I drive home later on.It has other oddities: the layout, for instance, with its strangely plummeting boot; the fact that both rear seats come down in one plank, limiting the possibilities of carrying people and cargo. Then there is the snugness of the cabin, which means that every time I change gear, I half grope Brand’s thigh. She’s polite about it, though.It has a touch-screen display that, while sleek, proves mildly infuriating – not least because it includes the temperature control, so you have the faff of scrolling through menus before you can cool the car. In the end, we just roll down the windows.Brand doesn’t drive the distances she used to; when she was on the comedy circuit, she would be heading up and down the motorway, back and forth from gigs, quite regularly. “I used to like driving late at night and just having that time on my own,” she recalls. “I do like driving in silence. It’s just the nicest way to clear your head: driving on an empty motorway at 1am with absolute silence. It almost gets quite meditative.”Marriage, too, has changed her approach to driving. “I’m worried that since I got married I’m becoming one of those women who doesn’t drive on motorways any more,” she admits. “Which I’m horrified by.” If she ever wants to reclaim her daredevil motoring spirit, she could get a moped. She shakes her head: “Never again.”Citroen C4 CactusPrice£17,190Top speed117mphAcceleration0-62mph in 9.3 secondsCombined fuel consumption60.1mpgCO2emissions107g/kmEco rating7/10Cool rating6/10On the stereo99 Problems by Jay-Z• Katy Brand’s filmWalking On Sunshineis out now on Blu-Ray and DVD, courtesy of Entertainment One.Follow Laura onTwitter.
Brianna Wu doesn’t know when she can go home again. She can’t tell me where she is – doing so might not be safe. Last Friday, her personal details were pasted on the chat forum, 8chan. Within minutes she was receiving sickening threats. One tweet said, “I’ve got a K-bar and I’m coming to your house so I can shove it up your ugly feminist cunt.” She said to her husband, “we’ve got to get out of here”. They called the police; the police agreed. She was sobbing uncontrollably.Brianna Wu is a games developer.Four years ago, after working in animation, and then journalism, Wu founded a small development studio,Giant Spacekat. The company’s first game, Revolution 60, was launched earlier this year: it’s a cartoonish science fiction adventure for smartphones, notable for its all-female cast and cinematic story, a rarity on mobile platforms. The critical response has been favourable, andWu drew quite a following on Twitter, both through her game and her work hosting the gaming podcast Isometric.She has also been vocal in her condemnation of Gamergate, a loose affiliation of discontented gamers, ostensibly massing over fears of journalistic corruption – though originally driven by a 4chan campaign targeting another female game developer, Zoe Quinn, sparked by a rambling blogpost by an ex-boyfriend of Quinn’s, Eron Gjoni.Last week, a fan of Wu’s work produced a photo meme, featuring some of her humorously barbed tweets about Gamergate. She liked the joke, so she re-tweeted. Gamers on 8Chan, the forum where a sizeable section of the Gamergate community now meets, took offense. So they started to generate their own versions of the meme, jammed with insults.A fan made a meme of 6 of my Tweets.#Gamergatespent day filling it with 36 pages of garbagehttp://t.co/tjzQxePXH0pic.twitter.com/aailgFlNM9&mdash; Brianna Wu (@Spacekatgal)October 9, 2014Then someone posted a stash of her personal details – a form of internet abuse known as doxing. “I was literally watching the chat room as the site posted my address and the conversation moved to places that threatened my personal safety,” she says. “I made the decision to leave, and law enforcement said it was reasonable. I basically just left the house. I have no idea where I’ll be living this week or even next month.”The blame gameWu blamed Gamergate’s participants; they took exception. There were genuine attempts by followers of the movement to take down the increasingly violent insults. But there were also dozens of tweets more concerned with defelecting blame than expressing horror. There was also skepticism: some suggested, just as they had when developer Zoe Quinn and cultural critic Anita Sarkeesian were forced from their homes by threats, that Wu had made it up (a practice generally known as a “false flag”: such phrases from military psychological warfare are becoming part of the discourse).Understandably, it’s an accusation that Wu scoffs at. “I’d like to think I’m a respected developer in this field,” she says. “At this point the FBI is involved. My local police department is involved, the Massachusetts cybercrime division is involved. If I made this up, I’ll be going to jail. I can think of no quicker way to destroy my career than doing something stupid like that.“I think it shows a really disturbing mindset from people on the other side of this. They want to attack the person that’s the victim of a crime. It’s a terrible, destructive impulse.”Wu is a game developer; that’s how she wants to be known. But she is now something else too – a media personality; a figurehead in this bizarre and bewildering cultural war between a subset of angry gamers, and just about everyone else. She has spent the week talking to media outlets – Bloomberg, CNN, CBS, the Washington Post. Sheappeared on MSNBC’s Reid Reporttalking about industry sexism and harassment. She has been on the recentBBC Tech Tentprogramme about Gamergate.“I think there is a war on women in technology,” she said to the BBC’s technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones. “It’s not like I’m advocating that we ban Call of Duty or anything silly like that, I’m asking is for companies to look at their hiring practices, to hire more women... and make sure they portray women in their games in a socially responsible way.”The abuse continues. “Last night, someone was tweeting me quotes from my death threats,” she says. “Even scarier for me is the public campaign to discredit and destroy me by Gamergaters. Reddit has an entire thread devoted to it. 8chan and 4chan also have entire threads.” Just today, Wu tweeted a link to an apparent discreditation project named Operation Falseflag II: it proposes creating fake feminist Twitter accounts and then attacking her game for objectifying women.The campaign to destroy me professionally continues. They&#39;re targeting my game Revolution 60. Please RT!pic.twitter.com/ssQmgktgA1&mdash; Brianna Wu (@Spacekatgal)October 17, 2014While many Gamergate voices have strenuously denied being involved in Wu’s harassment – even though much of it is being generated on the 8chan site (as Gamergate discussions have been banned from 4chan by the site’s owner) – the developer herself as no doubts.Flames, misogyny and sexism“I want to say unequivocally, Gamergate did this to me,” she says. “If I’m saying this less on Twitter it’s because I feel fanning the flames will endanger my life even more. I know that many #gamergate supporters are trying their best to distance themselves from these events, but I agree with many others that feel the movement is inexorably linked with misogyny and sexism.“Don’t take my word for it. Anyone can go to 8chan, a website entirely for Gamergaters. You can read what they post about me and other women. It’s not just casual sexism, it’s angry, violent sexism. They don’t see me, Zoe or Anita as people, just objects to be destroyed.“I am a programmer. If I write code, I don’t evaluate the results by what I hope the code will be. I evaluate it by what happens when I compile it. I evaluate it by results. Right now, the result of #gamergate is this: Every woman I know in the industry is scared. Many have thought about quitting. Three of us have been the victims of death threats, and some of this have been driven from our homes.”So what’s next, what has to happen? “The most terrifying outcome from this would be if this becomes the new normal for women in this industry,” she says. “I can’t pretend there are easy answers. Both Zoe Quinn and I are represented by senator Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts. I reached out to her this week, because I’d like to see what work can be done on a national policy level.“We need legislation that requires sites like 8chan to store IP addresses. We need legislation that makes it possible for law enforcement to track down the people that do this. We need the game industry to cover these events when they happen - look at IGN, it’s radio silence from them.”Wu says she’s not eating, and not sleeping well. She doesn’t know where she’ll be living or sleeping next month. This is because she made games, talked about sexism and enjoyed a joke at Gamergate’s expense.And before that. Anita Sarkeesian, swamped with threats and hatred for analysing games and representation; Zoe Quinn, targeted because of disproved claims that she slept with a games journalist in return for positive coverage. Jenn Frank, one of the best writers about games and games culture for the last ten years, chased from the industry thanks toa piece she wrote for the Guardian about online abuse. The irony is so bitter it burns. I commissioned that article. I edited it. I was devastated by Frank’s understandable decision; devastated for my part in it.Banners and flagsI don’t think that everyone who uses Gamergate is evil, but moderates need to look at what is being done under, or within spitting distance of, its banner. Lives are being ruined and the world’s media is looking at gamers, just at a time when the medium was being taken seriously, and it is seeing its prejudices realised. Gamergate wasfront-page news in the New York Timeswhen Sarkeesian had tocancel a talk over threats of a “massacre”(also dismissed as a “false flag” by Gamergate supporters); Cellan-Joneswroteon the BBC’s site that while he wouldn’t pick over the rights and wrongs of Gamergate (for the BBC is assiduous in not taking any sides in any debate),“a couple of things are clear. It started with attacks on a female developer and the journalists she knew, and has given rise to a whole lot more viciousness, most of it aimed at women who dare to raise their heads above the parapet.”If a BBC correspondent states that, you can take it as fact.Earlier this week, Gear of War designer Cliff Bleszinzkiblogged on this very issue. He wrote this:“We’re the gamers, the dorks. We’re the ones who were on our computers during prom. We’re the ones that were in the back of the lunch room who were playing D&amp;D instead of tossing a football around on the quad. We were supposed to be the open, friendly ones, the ones who welcomed all into our wonderful geeky circle.“We’re not supposed to be a mob that’s storming the gates with our pitchforks and torches.”It’s time for reasonable people to pull away. To form something else. To take everything they’ve learned about agitation and protest, and apply it in a very different way. Don’t have all this on your conscience.We need to create an industry in which people can question practices and conventions, but also where all are welcome and safe. For a start, however, we need to create an industry in which, whatever you think of their views, Quinn, Sarkeesian and Wu can go home.We just have to make sure they can go home in peace.
The latest version of Apple’s operating system for desktop and laptop computers, Mac OS X 10.10 “Yosemite”, encourages users to turn on the company’s FileVault disk encryption, as the company hardens its pro-security stance.The decision to encourage encryption, so that users must opt out – rather than opting in as has been the case since FileVault was introduced in 2003 – shows the company refusing to back down topressure from the US governmentto restrict the availability of cryptographic tools to the public.On Thursday, the FBI’s director, James Comey,decried the company’s decision to offer similar toolson mobile devices running iOS 8.“With Apple’s new operating system, the information stored on many iPhones and other Apple devices will be encrypted by default,” Comey told the Brookings Institute in Washington DC. “Shortly after Apple’s announcement, Google announced plans to follow suit with its Android operating system. This means the companies themselves won’t be able to unlock phones, laptops, and tablets to reveal photos, documents, email, and recordings stored within.”Comey continued: “At the outset, Apple says something that is reasonable – that it’s not that big a deal … Apple argues, for example, that its users can back up and store much of their data in ‘the cloud’ and that the FBI can still access that data with lawful authority. But uploading to the cloud doesn’t include all of the stored data on a bad guy’s phone, which has the potential to create a black hole for law enforcement.”But despite Comey’s pleas, the company shipped Yosemite with the FileVault option intact. The install process for the new operating system asks users if they would “like to use FileVault to encrypt the disk” on their Macs. Ticked by default are two boxes, “Turn on FileVault disk encryption” and “Allow my iCloud account to unlock my disk”.That means that unless the user actively declines the offer, their hard drives will be encrypted.Unlike a standard password-protected computer, which leaves the contents of a hard-drive accessible to anyone with the patience to remove the drive, FileVault encrypts the entire contents of a device at disk level, rendering it impossible for anyone without the login password to access the data on the computer.While the FBI has condemned Apple’s new commitment to security, civil liberties organisations have welcomed the decision. “We applaud tech leaders like Apple and Google that are unwilling to weaken security for everyone to allow the government yet another tool in its already vast surveillance arsenal,”said the American Civil Liberties Union’s Laura Murphyfollowing Comey’s speech. “We hope that others in the tech industry follow their lead and realize that customers put a high value on privacy, security and free speech.”Users on older versions of Mac OS X can still enable FileVault, but must dig into the operating system’s settings to do so; the feature is buried under the Security &amp; Privacy option in the system preferences. Windows users have long had access to a similar tool, also not enabled by default, called BitLocker, which can be turned on using Windows Explorer. It is not yet known whether Microsoft will make BitLocker use opt-out in its forthcoming Windows 10 release, expect next year and presently in developer testing.•Apple releases newest version of Mac OS, Yosemite, for download
Weeks after Facebookapologised for the way its “real-name” policyhad led to the suspension of numerous drag queens’ accounts, user accounts are still being suspended or deactivated for not using people’s legal names.Sister Roma,a 27-year veteran of San Francisco’s Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, is one of the leaders of the campaign to get Facebook to restore these accounts and has become a key liaison between the social media giant and people whose accounts continue to be suspended or deactivated.“Every time one or two get fixed, a handful get suspended,” Sister Roma told the Guardian. “So we really feel like we’re swimming upstream, and while I’m hopeful that Facebook is doing the right thing, it’s discouraging.”She and other members of the drag communitychallenged Facebook in Septemberafter their accounts were suspended or deactivated because they did not use their “real name”.Thousands rallied around the queensand others who might choose to use an alias on Facebook for safety reasons, like domestic abuse survivors or activists.Facebook’s Chris Cox said in the company’s apologythat one individual had reported hundreds of the accounts as fake and that the company missed the pattern in the mass of flagged account reports it receives. Many were reactivated after the Facebook apology, but accounts continue to be suspended or deactivated, including some belonging to New York City-based drag queens like Fussy Lo Mein, whose account was suspended then reactivated this week.“Whatever or however my deactivation happened, it caused me to remember how I used to feel growing up when the world projected on to me all those judgments: I felt dirty in their eyes, but I internalised those judgments and they became part of my own sad self-image,”she wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday.“These are feelings I haven’t remembered for decades, but it all came back to me.”Cox said earlier this month that the policy is meant to block impersonation, trolling and bullying by forcing users to use their legal names instead of being cloaked in anonymity. He said that the company is working to improve the reporting process and customer service.“We are committed to ensuring that all members of the Facebook community can use the authentic names they use in real life,” a Facebook representative said in an emailed statement. “Having people use their authentic names makes them more accountable, and also helps us root out accounts created for malicious purposes, like harassment, fraud, impersonation and hate speech. Our team is busy working to improve the implementation of this standard so that some of the issues people recently encountered can be prevented in the future.”In the meantime, Sister Roma said she has fielded 300 to 400 emails from people whose accounts have been suspended or deactivated. Facebook has given her a special email so that she can send it information about such users.“Facebook is not the enemy here, really,” said Sister Roma. “The problem is that people are using this policy that Facebook has in place to target and bully members of the Facebook community they don’t like.”She said people looking to restore access to their accounts must send her their profile URL, describe why their account was blocked or suspended and describe in their own words what their authentic identity is and why. “Your story, basically,” Sister Roma said.Sister Roma thinks a simple solution would be to remove the option to report an account because “the timeline is using a fake name”. This is the first option available to people who click through a profile to report an account.“I think reporting should be based on behaviour and not identity,” Sister Roma said. “Nobody wants these creepy bad users around, we’re all on the same page as far as that goes, but a reason to report somebody shouldn’t be just because they are using a fake name.”
Whistleblowing tool Whisper has been criticised for its defence of tracking of “anonymous” users, with Twitter’s former security head Moxie Marlinspike stating the site never should have claimed it should never have claimed to provide anonymity if it had to track users to make the app function.It was the failure to be open about that problem, Moxie argued, whichled to the Guardian’s revelationon Thursday that Whisper tracks its allegedly anonymous users - either with user consent using GPS data that is accurate to within a 500 metre radius, or where they have opted out establishing broad location using IP data.Moxie, who is also a contributor to Open Whisper Systems, a secure communications project which has no relation to Whisper (but has longheld a grudge against the start-upfor appropriating its name), was writingin response to Whisper’s chief technical officer, Chad DePue, on the link sharing site Hacker News.DePue,and Whisper’s Editor in Chief Neetzan Zimmerman, both vehemently deny the Guardian’s report.But Moxie argued that, far from debunking the news, DePue’s response backed up the Guardian’s claims. “It sounds like the reporting is entirely accurate,” he wrote. “You’re attempting to justify why you’re tracking your users, but you’re still tracking them.”“You’ve highlighted many of the hard problems in this space: how do you achieve anonymity and unlinkability while doing things like IP hiding, spam filtering, and relevance matching,” he asked.“The issue is that you haven’t solved the problems, and are instead suggesting you should get a pass because the problems are hard. It seems simple to me: if you haven’t designed something that gives you truly unlinkable anonymity, don’t claim to provide it. If you have to track your users to make your app work, don’t claim not to track your users.”Following the release of the Guardian’s story,Buzzfeedput its relationship with the Whisper on hold. The site had worked with Whisper on number of stories culled from the service, including29 confessions from the gaming widows of WhisperandThe heartbreaking military confessions of whisper.The Guardian had initially begun to work with Whisper tofind Iraq war veterans who wanted to share their opinions of Isis,find an undocumented immigrant to write an opinion articleandpost people’s confessions about Valentine’s Day.Despite denying much of the Guardian’s story,Whisper rewrote portions of its privacy policyafter the paper asked it for comment on the allegations.The new policy warns users for the first time that their general location may be determined even if they disable location services; that they share data with universities and other research institutions; and that they store user data in countries besides the United States.The updated privacy policy went live four days after the Guardian contacted Whisper, and three days before the paper published the story, but does not come into effect until 12 November.For Moxie, the firm’s approach undercuts the attempts of privacy-focused projects to provide real security. “There are projects like Tor that are approaching these types of problems seriously,” he writes, “but apps like Whisper or Secret end up poisoning the well and confusing users.“There’s a huge difference between ‘can’t’ track and ‘won’t’ track. Right now [Whisper is] claiming ‘can’t,’ but it sounds like [it’s] squarely in the ‘won’t’ category of having [its] servers ‘avert their eyes.’ I think this understandably makes people uneasy, particularly given the data mining direction it sounds like the company is headed.”Shortly after the Guardian published its story, Open Whisper Systems tweeted to clarify that it has no relationship to Whisper.Uhm, just a reminder that the snakeoil privacy app@whisperis unrelated to@whispersystems. Their name, like their app, is an affectation.&mdash; Open Whisper Systems (@whispersystems)October 16, 2014Revealed: how Whisper app tracks ‘anonymous’ users
It’s not the first time an employee of a company has been sacked – or inUberlanguage “deactivated” – for their social media activity, but the case of the Albuquerque Uber driver Christopher Ortiz seems particularly severe.Ortiz, 33, had worked as an UberX driver for the smartphone taxi app in May and June of this year, before leaving to set up a media startup, Newscastic. When he tried to return to driving to top up his income, Ortiz found his driver account had been “deactivated”.Uber Operations Manager, John Hamby, explained in an email to Ortiz that he could not drive for the company “due to hateful statements regarding Uber through social media”.Here is the email Ortiz received:Photograph: Christopher OrtizOrtiz identified the “hateful statements” as this one tweet he had sent in August linking to aPando Daily articleentitled “With another Uber driver robbed in LA, questions mount about safety of ride-sharing apps”.Driving for Uber, not much safer than driving a taxihttp://t.co/rEJhvYlK4G&mdash; Christopher J. Ortiz (@ChrisJOrtiz)August 25, 2014In an email to the Guardian, Ortiz wrote that his initial reaction to the email from Uber was to laugh, as it was so “ludicrous”.Ortiz did not write the article, nor had he added comment when linking to the article.“That’s the craziest part of this whole thing. They didn’t take into context of the tweet”, he wrote.“It was very heavy handed. I have mentioned Uber dozens of times in tweets since I last drove for the company – tweeting negative and positive stories. I have several friends who drive and I like sharing stories about Uber with them.”Asked how he thought Uber had discovered his tweet, Ortiz expressed surprise that the company was monitoring his Twitter account as it had been at least two months since he had worked for them when he posted the tweet.“But I’m not entirely surprised that they were aware of my Twitter account since I’ve had multiple exchanges with the @Uber_ABQ account while I was a driver (just questions and promoting the service).“I have no idea when my driver account was deactivated but I’m sure they pulled the plug when they read my ‘hateful comment’”, he added.Uber’s stance seems uber over the top, especially given drivers are contracted as self-employed rather than full time employees in order to limit Uber’s liability – conditions set out in the company’slegal terms and conditions.After Ortiz tweeted about his experience to Pando Daily editor Michael Carney on Thursday night and his situation went viral, Uber did a swift U-turn on their decision calling it a “mistake”. The company issued the following statement to the Guardian:This was an error by the local team and the driver’s account should have never been deactivated. We reactivated the account upon discovering the mistake and we apologise to this highly rated driver partner for the inconvenience.I&#39;ve suddenly been approved as a driver.pic.twitter.com/aP77oSlLuH&mdash; Christopher J. Ortiz (@ChrisJOrtiz)October 17, 2014Oritz has not yet decided whether he will take up Uber’s offer to reactivate his account, but is erring on the side of caution:“Probably not because it would just be awkward and I like to avoid awkward confrontations. Plus the only reason I wanted to drive again was because the annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta was here and I thought there would be a high demand for drivers”.Ortiz added that the company has not apologised directly to him. Although he did mention that his general experience of working for Uber was positive, aside from an incident where it took a while to recoup money for a smashed wing-mirror.The main point Oritz makes is the discrepancy between Uber drivers’ status as non-employees and the conditions they are held to.“I think the scariest thing here is that drivers can be removed from the Uber system if they don’t toe the company line.“Uber has made it clear that drivers are not employees, they’re independent contractors, but it seems they want to hold drivers to employee standards (speaking negatively about a company online).“It would be a scary situation if I was depending on Uber as my primary source of income”, he added.Ortiz’s rating was an impressive 4.8 stars out of five. We’re giving Uber 0 for this debacle.•Car sharing service Uber banned in Germany
Shinji Mikami, the creator of Resident Evil, has a reputation as a difficult interview. He’s not rude or evasive at all, but he is quiet and understated, and sometimes his responses are short. Reporters desperate for background information on the origins of survival horror are often left frustrated.But when we met him in his studio last month, right at the end of the development cycle on his latest thriller, The Evil Within, he was quite different. Perhaps relieved to be on the final furlong of this four-year project, perhaps more comfortable in his own domain rather than amid the chaos and noise of a games convention, he was open and affable.So we talked for a while. I wanted to find out about his experience as a freelance producer and director, working with two of the most interesting forces in modern Japanese game design: Grasshopper Manufacture (Killer 7, No More Heroes) and Platinum Games (Vanquish, Bayonetta). He didn’t have much to say about the latter, but he was clearly fascinated by Grasshopper founder and creative force, Goichi Suda, better known as Suda 51.“I didn’t so much learn from Suda 51, but I recognised how differently he works,” says Mikami. “When I design, I am always aware of the people who are going to play my game, and I’m always trying to reach a balance between what I want to do and how people are going to react to and experience it.“Suda 51, on the other hand says, ‘this is what I want to do, this is what I’m going to make, if you want to have that experience too, join me’. It ends there. It’s much more about what he wants – at least that’s how it seems. One of these days, I’d like to make a game where it’s all about what I want to do! It’s like the way Spielberg admires Akira Kurosawa: Kurosawa calls the shots oneverything, he’s an amazing creator, but there is an atmosphere that if you’re not 100% with him, you’ll be cast out of the production, whereas Spielberg seems more collaborative. Suda is much more Kurosawa.”Japan risesWe get on to the state of the Japanese industry; how it has been through a dip over the past few years. Classic series’ like Resident Evil and Ridge Racer stalled creatively, relying on dated game design mechanics while western developers used their huge budgets to create massive open-world action games. But it seems the world is turning back – the likes of Dark Souls and Bayonetta 2 are intriguing gamers again – even though they are steeped in the dense, complex conventions of old.Why is this? “Maybe it’s because there aresomany games out there now with a big cinematic feel to them,” says Mikami. “You are put into this vast world and you experience all of these situations … but there is more emphasis placed on the creation of the universe and the cinematic drama rather than the actual gameplay itself. Maybe it’s old school but I think Dark Souls and maybe Evil Within … they feel more fun, the gameplay itself is more exciting. I think we are now rediscovering this.”The latest trend in Western game design is seamless co-op play – Far Cry 4, Sunset Overdrive, Destiny – the social media boom has given rise to a new generation of games that require constant contact. But co-op seems anathema to the spirit of survival horror; not only does it give you someone to lean on, it usually also alters the design balance in favour of action – see the disappointing Resident Evil 5 and risible Dead Space 3.“I think co-op and horror are two very separate experiences,” says Mikami. “but I don’t think the era of co-op will interfere with single-player horror. Horror games are most scary when you’re by yourself.”So can there be no co-op horror adventures that really work? “There’s one way to do it maybe,” he says. “Imagine a situation where multiple players are trapped in a room, or a level, where resources are scarce, and where there are enemies out to get all the players. Perhaps to survive, you have to share and swap those resources, but as the game continues, the items become more scarce – you need that player’s gun, or that other player’s food. So maybe you co-operate, but ultimately you may have to betray your partners just to survive in the chaos.”I joke that he’s basically creating a new sub-genre: co-operation panic. “Yes, exactly,” he laughs. “I’m also really interested in the gameplay mechanics of friendly fire - it’s something you have to be careful with. It could turn out to be comical rather than horror - if you accidentally got shot in the back of the head while defending against multiple enemies. But there are also interesting trust ramifications: say, during the game, you meet another player who is dressed in a mismatch of clothing and items, then perhaps it’s stuff that he’s stolen from other players …”Resident Evil meets DayZ? Maybe that’s the next project from Mikami. Although I do put something else to him. He has mentioned in the past that when he was a kid, he wanted to be an F1 driver – and he once worked on an F1 game for Capcom that was later canned. So, how about a survival horror driving game? The player must get through a post-apocalyptic environment, driving from place to place – and this time the scarce resource is petrol rather than bullets?He thinks about this for a while. “Actually, I think in some ways this has already been done,” he says. “The Colin McRae games on the PlayStation - they got very close to the survival horror structure.” And he’s right of course: one player against a hostile environment; limited time, limited resources, the constant fear of what lurks around the next corner. Mikami knows what he’s doing.The Evil Within has divided critics – some love its remix on survival horror essentials, others see it as retrogressive. But everyone always wants to see what Mikami is up to next. He doesn’t make boring games – and even if he sees himself as the Spielberg to Suda 51’s Kurosawa, the two designers at least have that in common.The Evil Within: how Shinji Mikami has modernised survival horrorThe Evil Within review – a heady fix of pure survival horror
British startupPlaylists.net, which collects playlists created for streaming music service Spotify, has been acquired by major label Warner Music Group’s WEA subsidiary.The Newcastle-based company launched in 2009 as ShareMyPlaylists, before rebranding to Playlists.net in 2013. It has aggregated more than 150,000 playlists, while its website and apps were attracting more than 1.1 million users a month by the start of 2014.WEA has not said how much it paid for Playlists.net, but the company will remain a standalone operation under its founder and chief executive Kieron Donoghue.“We were approached by WEA earlier in the year to discuss ways in which we could collaborate and it became apparent that there was much to be gained by us joining forces,” he said, as the deal was announced.“What’s really exciting is that WEA have committed to support Playlists.net as an independent platform, invest in its future and grow the team to take advantage of new opportunities in the streaming ecosystem.”For its part, WEA’s senior vice president Larry Mattera said that the acquisition will boost Playlists.net as an independent site.“Kieron’s success is due to the fact that he is a huge music fan, and has a uniquely creative take on how to engage other music fans,” he said. “This investment will enable Kieron to expand on his existing formula for success, as well as work to create new music experiences.”The deal is timely, as playlists and curation are currently buzzwords within the music industry, as services like Spotify – which has more than 40m users including 10m paying subscribers – become more influential in the way music is discovered and marketed.All three major labels have dedicated divisions for curating and promoting streaming playlists: Universal Music’s is calledDigster, Sony Music’s is calledFiltr, and Playlist.net’s ultimate parent company now – Warner Music – has itsPlaylistMedepartment.The strategy in all three cases is to attract hundreds of thousands, or even millions of followers to playlists based on themes and genres, then use those playlists to “seed” new tracks as they are released.Playlists.net had been working with several labels on marketing campaigns based around playlists, so it’s an obvious fit for a company like WEA – although rival labels will be watching closely to see how WEA sticks to its commitment to “an independent platform” over the coming months.•Ed Sheeran talks Spotify royalties•Music streams up and downloads down.

From Dundee to London, to Cambridge and Brighton, there is a buzz as tech hubs pop up everywhere across the UK. People from all over the world are taking note – and they want to be part of it too.Michelle Songy and Charlotte Kohlmann, both originally from the US, this year chose to launch Spleat, a mobile payment app for the hospitality industry, in London. Kohlmann says: “The startup scene in London is booming. The hospitality sector is also going through a renaissance. People eat out more, and with 30 restaurants opening up every month, we thought London would be the ideal city to launch.” Spleat is now accepted at a number of London restaurants and pubs including Ping Pong and The Library.But just how easy was it for them to launch a business in the UK? Songy and Kohlmann had to apply for UK entrepreneur visas. “It’s not impossible to get the visa, but it takes time,” says Songy. In an industry that moves as quickly as tech, this can be a huge problem for entrepreneurs.‘Visas can be a nightmare for entrepreneurs’Part of the visa criteria meant that they needed a viable business plan along with an investment of £50,000 from a government-approved funder, or access to £200,000. Songy and Kohlmann went for the latter, and received investment from angel funders in the US. “When you have investment and see how quickly the industry moves, you don’t want the visa holding you back. If I were to do it again, I’d read up on the visa sooner and learn what I was getting in to,” Songy says. “My advice: hire a lawyer. It’s expensive, but worth it in the end.”“Visas can be a bit of a nightmare for some entrepreneurs,” immigration lawyer Sophie Barrett-Brown says. “With a tier-one entrepreneur visa, younger applicants are at greater risk of refusal because they may not have a business background. In the tech sector this can be problematic because often these applicants are very well-educated with brilliant ideas, but don’t have a string of businesses behind them to demonstrate their track record.”Since launching, Songy and Kohlmann have hired five employees and are slowly recruiting more as they grow their business, adding them to a group of migrant entrepreneurs who have employed 1.16m people out of a total of 8.3m people, equating to 14% of SME job-creation in the UK, according to a report released by the Centre for Entrepreneurs and DueDil in March 2014.Overseas talent fills UK skills shortagesMigrant entrepreneurs, according to the report, are also behind one-in-seven of all UK companies, with 155 nationalities represented. A YouGov survey released at the same time found that 44% of Britons believe that migrant entrepreneurs make a positive contribution to the UK. So why is it so difficult for migrant entrepreneurs to set up shop in the UK?Barrett-Brown also advises UK businesses on how to bring digital talent from overseas to fill skills shortages on sponsorship visas, which she says can be difficult and time-consuming, particularly for startups. “I’d like to see something like the post-study work category reintroduced – this could be limited to specific subjects to focus on addressing skills gaps rather than allowing all graduates to remain in the UK,” she says.The post-study work category enabled graduates to seek employment without having a sponsor, but it ended in April 2012, Foreign students who now wish to stay in the UK after their course either have to prove they have a job offer from a government-approved tier-two sponsor employer, or apply for an independent status such as tier-one entrepreneur, requiring a minimum £50,000 investment.Barrett-Brown says: “The post-study work category would work well in the tech sector because you get young talented people exploring ideas and businesses can experiment to see if they’re suitable for the role. Now businesses have to formally sponsor new graduates and formally advertise a vacancy, rather than say to a graduate, ‘you have great ideas, let’s try this out’.”Tech industry demands visa changesIn September 2014,Coadeclaunched The Startup Manifesto, backed by 200 startups with 24 points on how the next government can make the UK a world leader in digital innovation. Like Barrett-Brown, they too would like to see the post-study work visa reinstated, along with making it easier and faster for them to hire from overseas. For example, 20% of sponsor visas take more than eight weeks to process once an application has been submitted according to gov.uk guidelines.Time is something many startups don’t have. The Flubit CEO, Bertie Stephens, doesn’t think the government understands how the tech industry works. “Once we get funding, we need a developer straight away, and sometimes there isn’t a qualified person in the UK or EU,” he says. “We need a more streamlined process for visas, like a slick technology platform that matches up pre-approved international tech professionals with startup businesses.” Stephens currently has a team of 60, and half those come from outside the UK. “Our British developers have learned a great deal from our international ones, which has helped them grow professionally.”The government has tried to ease the pressure on the digital skills shortage by allowing tech city to endorse 200 exceptional talent visas. Barrett-Brown, though, doesn’t think these fully meet the needs of the industry. “It’s a good move forward, but essentially it requires that the person coming is someone who has an international reputation, which is great for those who qualify, but not great at capturing that bright young talent who may not have a long work history.”David Hanson, shadow minister for home affairs, thinks the current government has created a climate in which migrant tech entrepreneurs and IT professionals are not welcome. “It’s absolutely right we should have world leading innovators and entrepreneurs coming to the UK and making our country a leader in new technology but unfortunately this government’s aggressive rhetoric and misjudged net-migration target is stopping the best and brightest – those we need for our economy to thrive – from coming.“A thriving UK tech sector will help build skills here at home and boost our economy, but to get those benefits we need a progressive immigration system that works for the UK and encourages investment; unfortunately four years of this government have led to business visas taking longer and a message that people aren’t welcome despite their skills,” he says.Whatever needs to happen to solve this, tech entrepreneurs and tech businesses want it to happen now. “I don’t think the government understands that as a startup, I don’t have five months to wait,” says Stephens. “The tech industry moves quickly, and we need a visa system that can respond to that.”
Frankly, half an hour on a cross-trainer is enough to leave this journalist looking like a dazed apocalypse survivor. But an upcoming smartphone app is aiming to pair fitness and global disaster in a more positive way.Apocalypse Survival Trainingis the work of Londoner Adele Kirby, whose company Imaginactive Ltd is developing the game for Android and iPhone smartphones, and raising money to make it using crowdfunding website Kickstarter.The company describes the game as an “audio fitness adventure... an app-delivered radio play series that drops you into the heart of an action story” which, although it is set in London, can be played anywhere.“AST Season 1 is a progressive full body and mind/body workout set during an apocalyptic alien attack on London. You are dropped in with a dysfunctional group of survivors of the initial assault, who are forced to band together to get through London to try to halt the invasion,” explains its Kickstarter listing.“It runs over 37 cyclical 30 minute episodes alternating between strength circuits, holistic training and running... It will be available on iPhone and Android and require only your imagination, phone and a pair of headphones to use.”Imaginactive set a goal of £10,000 to finish making the game, and has reached that target with 14 more days to go in its crowdfunding campaign. According to the Kickstarter listing, the company also has “some private investment”, and is aiming to release the finished game by October 2015.Concept artwork for Apocalypse Survival Training.Apocalypse Survival Training isn’t the first of its genre. It is following in the (literal) footsteps ofZombies, Run!, an app made by developer Six to Start and author Naomi Alderman, which also involved surviving an apocalypse – albeit with undead characters rather than aliens.That project was also Kickstarter-funded –it raised $72,627 in 2011– before being released for Android and iPhone. It has since been played by more than 1m people, and spawned a separateZombies, Run! 5k Trainingapp, while the main app’s use of TV-style “seasons” appears to have inspired Apocalypse Survival Training.The latter’s Kickstarter listing doesn’t shirk comparisons – “There are fantastic gamified audio adventure apps out there which you may have tried and we love too” – but suggests that its focus on three different types of exercise rather than just running will be its unique selling point.“We’re experimenting with using the story to respect the rules of writing a good progressive training programme,”explains Imaginactive’s website.“When you follow the format and exercise regularly, you will notice the evolution of your fitness over the months and gain mastery of the mind and body elements of the programme, all while learning more about your companions, the nature of the aliens, the reason for the invasion and the ‘Catalyst’ virus responsible for the whole disaster.”•Unfitbit: when fitness tracking goes wrong
I have photos all over the place: PC, Android tablet, mobile phone etc. I would like to get them all under one roof. What is the simplest, most efficient way of doing this? I have heard of Google+, Picasa, Media Monkey, Flickr …TomAs you have a PC, that’s the obvious place to store them. Of course, as they are irreplaceable, you will need to store them in more than one place, and the more places the better.Getting them all under one roof – or into one file directory – is relatively simple, once you have decided how to organise that directory. The final decision depends partly on what sort of photo collection you have. If you specialise in photographing a limited range of topics, you might want to organise them by subject. But the best option for most people is to store them by the date on which they were taken.Storing by dateIn fact, your digital camera may already do this for you. My Canon G15, for example, adds the month to the folder number: 123__09, 124__10 and so on. If you’re a pro and take tons of photos, you might have a different folder for each day. Most people should have one folder per month (2014-03 etc). It’s reasonable to have from 50 to 250 photos in each folder, but 500 to 1,000 is too many.Your PC can sort photos by the date they were taken, because the date is recorded inExif(Exchangeable image file format) tags inside the image.You can make this information visible in Windows Explorer. To do this, right-click on the folder name and select Properties. Go to the Customize tab where it asks: “What kind of folder do you want?” Choose “Pictures” from the drop-down menu and make it apply to all the subfolders. After that, right-click in the Windows Explorer menu bar (eg next to Name) and add the columns you want. The options include 35mm focal length, camera maker and model, lens maker and model, light source, subject, and many more.Happily, there are free programs that will do the sorting and filing for you. For example,PhotoMove 2will “automatically move photos to directories or folders based on [the Exif] date taken”, while the Pro version will also find duplicates, among other things.DIM(Digital Image Mover) is a less sophisticated alternative.Renaming and de-dupingThe second big decision is whether to rename your photos. Since yours come from diverse sources, they will have different file names starting with DSC (Nikon), IMG (Canon), SAM (Samsung) or whatever. Some people like to rename them all to a standard format that starts with a reverse date and a keyword. For example, you could rename DSCN0101 to 20080830-London-DSCN0101. That way, all the files will sort easily. You wouldn’t want to rename hundreds by hand, but some photo management programs provide a renaming option when you import photos. If not, you can use abulk file renamer.Once you have all your photos in a single directory structure, you can go through them and delete the ones you don’t want. You can also use a program to find any duplicates. There are many options. I useDoubleKiller, which matches checksums and sizes. There’s alsoVisiPics, a clever program that will find duplicates that have different resolutions, or file formats, or are just slightly different pictures.BackupsAt this point, you should take a backup. Today, a 3TB external hard drive such as a WD Elements is the most economical way to back up a PC. A smaller drive would probably do. If you shoot compressed jpg images, you’re unlikely to have more than 100-200GB.You could also back them up to a cloud service. Again, there are plenty of options, but it’s worth testing them with a dozen pics to see how well they work. They must keep the whole photo, without reducing it to a smaller size for online display, and ideally keep the original file name.Following the sad demise of Everpix, the ones worth trying include Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Yahoo’s Flickr. I like Dropbox, but it’s too expensive for large-scale storage. OneDrive is much cheaper, a tad slower, and generally reliable, though I’ve had photos that didn’t upload completely from phones. (I’ve also usedCopybut I’m not fond of the interface and found uploads somewhat slow.)Flickr is by far the best value as it gives you a terabyte of free space. Against that, Flickr is not as easy to use, it stores things by upload date, and I fear for people who are not very careful with the privacy settings. But Flickr does work well with the Adobe Lightroom photo management program, which will keep a Flickr album synchronised with a Lightroom album.Bear in mind that online services can lose your data, be plundered (like Apple’s iCloud), go bust or close down, as happened with Streamload, Kodak Gallery, Nirvanix, Snapjoy and Everpix. Sites can also ban you for no obvious reason, in which case you will lose access to your account. You must have a local backup.Note: I’ve discounted any photo editing, sharing and display features as they are irrelevant to backups. However, Dropbox, OneDrive and Flickr are all pretty good for sharing photos, as is Google+.Organising albumsYour database of photos should now remain essentially unchanged, but you may want to edit and view photos, organise them into albums, rate them, add captions and so on -- without moving the originals. All this involves the use of metadata, most of which could be “owned” by your photo management program. If so, all your work is locked in, unless there’s a way to export it and then import it into a different program.Again,there are plenty of photo organisers, so you could try a few and see which you like. The obvious ones are the Windows Live Photo Gallery for Windows users, iPhoto for Mac users, and Picasa for Google fans. Alternatives include Zoner Photo Studio Free, highly recommended byGizmo’s, and XnView.For serious photographers and professionals, Adobe Lightroom 5 is unrivalled, and by Adobe standards, very reasonably priced at£99.99. (It’s not worth saving a few quid on Adobe Photoshop Elements 12 at£76.99.) One of its most useful features is that you can apply a set of corrections to fine-tune a particular image and then apply the same corrections to a whole batch. It also provides “unlimited undo”, even after you have saved a file and closed the program. The drawback is that you lose your albums / thematic collections etc if you stop using Lightroom, but really, as with Photoshop, Lightroom is forever.More metadataEarlier, I mentioned the invisible Exif metadata that digital cameras add to pictures. There’s another important open standard, IPTC/XMP (International Press Telecommunications Council/Extensible Metadata Platform), which is supported by Adobe (its developer) and Microsoft. This allows other kinds of metadata to be stored, including Title, Author, Copyright and so on. It means you can add labels and captions that survive with the photo even if you stop using that photo management program. This is another plus for Lightroom.Programs that support IPTC/XMPinclude Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop Elements, XnView, Irfanview, Zoner Photo Studio, Picasa andBreezeBrowser Pro. Vista and Windows 7 also support it, though some of the fields use non-standard labels. SeeLabelling Digital Photosfor more information.If you use IPTC/XMP, be wary of non-compliant programs, as these may not preserve data they know nothing about.
Your Twitter timeline is about to get more musical, after the social network launched a new Twitter Audio Card feature that is already being used by SoundCloud and Apple’s iTunes.David Guetta, Deadmau5, Alt-J and Coldplay are among the musicians already taking advantage, although the new card can be used by non-musicians too: the White House, NASA, Washington Post and BBC World Service are also on board for the new feature’s launch.“With a single tap, the Twitter Audio Card lets you discover and listen to audio directly in your timeline on both iOS and Android devices,” explained Twitter product manager Richard Slatterin a blog post.“Throughout your listening experience, you can dock the Audio Card and keep listening as you continue to browse inside the Twitter app.”In SoundCloud’s case, the Audio Card opens up a full-screen player for the audio, complete with whatever artwork the creator has uploaded to SoundCloud for it. The audio will continue playing when the card is minimised, though.As the new feature launched, Guetta tweeted a link to a new remix of his song Dangerous, while Chance the Rapper followed suit with a link to his new single No Better Blues.“We’re just beginning to test the Audio Card and plan to make it available to more partners and creators in the future so that many more musical artists and creators will be able to share exclusive, in-the-moment audio to millions of listeners on Twitter,” wrote Slatter.An hour after announcing the SoundCloud partnership, Twitter revealed thatApple is also using the new cards for its iTunes Store, with links to the store popping up a full-screen preview player, with links to then pre-order or buy the songs.Foo Fighters were the first artist to take advantage, tweeting a link to their new single Something From Nothing.Although it’s not just for music, the new card is Twitter’s latest attempt to make it easier for users to listen to songs. The companylaunched its Twitter #music app and website in April 2013, recommending tracks and artists based on their popularity on the social network among other factors.The app was not a success, and was closed in April 2014. However, Twitter has since continued its music work in other ways: for example, launching a“Trending 140” chartwith music industry magazine Billboard in May.Twitter also works behind the scenes with a number of artists and labels, helping them make the most of its social network.Twitter and SoundCloud’s partnership goes back to 2012, when the latterbecame a partner for Twitter’s “expanded tweets” feature– similar to the new Twitter Audio Card, but for desktop users rather than mobile.In May this year, there was speculation thatTwitter might even buy SoundCloud, although the rumours died down, with conflicting reports that the barrier was either SoundCloud’s lack of licensing deals with music labels and publishers, or afailure to agree on a valuation for the company.•Twitter putting tweets in your timeline from people you don’t follow
Facebook has added a new feature that will make it easier for people to check that friends are safe when caught up in natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis.Safety Check will work on the social network’s mobile and desktop versions, including its Android and iOS apps.When someone’s within range of an unfolding natural disaster, they’ll get a notification from Facebook prompting them to tap a button to signify that they’re safe, or to say they’re not in the area.Selecting “I’m Safe” will post an update to that effect on Facebook for friends to see – presumably these will get a high weighting in the algorithm used to decide which stories are displayed in news feeds – with the option to also receive notifications when friends mark themselves as safe during a disaster.“We’ll determine your location by looking at the city you have listed in your profile, your last location if you’ve opted in to the Nearby Friends product, and the city where you are using the internet,” explained Facebook’s Naimo Gleit, Sharon Zeng and Peter Cottlein a blog post.They add that the feature was inspired by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011, with Facebook’s Japanese engineers subsequently developing a tool – the Disaster Message Board – to help people make contact during and after disasters.“Each time, we see people, relief organisations and first responders turn to Facebook in the aftermath of a major natural disaster,” explained the blog post.“These events have taught us a lot about how people use Facebook during disasters and we were personally inspired to continue work on the Disaster Message Board to incorporate what we’ve learned. This project soon became Safety Check.”While the feature appears to be focused on natural disasters, it could also be used for other kinds of crises: terrorist attacks, for example.•Social media’s crucial role in disaster relief efforts

A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamHere's why public Wi-fi is a public health hazard &gt;&gt; MatterMaurits Martijn:In his backpack, Wouter Slotboom, 34, carries around a small black device, slightly larger than a pack of cigarettes, with an antenna on it. I meet Wouter by chance at a random cafe in the center of Amsterdam. It is a sunny day and almost all the tables are occupied. Some people talk, others are working on their laptops or playing with their smartphones.Wouter removes his laptop from his backpack, puts the black device on the table, and hides it under a menu. A waitress passes by and we ask for two coffees and the password for the WiFi network. Meanwhile, Wouter switches on his laptop and device, launches some programs, and soon the screen starts to fill with green text lines. It gradually becomes clear that Wouter's device is connecting to the laptops, smartphones, and tablets of cafe visitors.KnowYour4: Four Numbers Can Predict Your Risk of a Heart AttackTotal cholesterol, HDLcholesterol, blood pressure and smoking.

Up 20% from the preceding year's quarter.• Network revenue: $3.43bn. Up 9% from the preceding year's quarter.• International revenue: 58% of revenue. Up 2% from the preceding year's quarter.The company reported that its average cost-per-click fell 2% in the period, a weakening in a key revenue source. However, pushing back against that decline was a 17% year-over-year increase in "aggregate paid clicks". So, while the amount of revenue that Google managed to extract from a click went down mildly, it sold more than one-sixth more compared to the year-ago quarter.It is becoming more expensive to run Google. The company's earnings report details its increasing cost base: "Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $6.10bn in the third quarter of 2014, or 37% of revenues, compared to $4.58bn in the third quarter of 2013, or 33% of revenues." Put another way: Building out new revenue streams, and investing in future products that won't monetize for some time isn't cheap.ABI Research: Apple Watch will end Android's smart watch dominance &gt;&gt; FierceWirelessAndroid's dominance of the smart watch market will come to an end in 2015 when the operating system's (OS') share of the sector will fall to under 50% for the first time as it succumbs to pressure from Apple.ABI Research forecasts the share of Google Android powered smart watches will fall even as device shipments using the OS rise. The research company predicted that the number of Android smart watches shipped will grow from around 6m units in 2014 to 15m in 2015, but noted that shipments of Apple's Watch will begin to take share from Android rivals when it launches in 2015.Apple's iOS is tipped to take a 35% stake in the smart watch market in 2015, and go on to establish at least a 50% share in the years after, according to ABI Research. In contrast, Android's share is tipped to fall from 67% in 2014 to 42% in 2015. The research company noted that Android accounted for 75% of smart watch shipments in 2013.Something of a reverse of the usual story.Porn's operating system battle &gt;&gt; PornhubAll that you could ever want to know (and slightly more you probably don't) about the denizens of Pornhub in terms of their operating system (and search) preferences.

I realized that everybody around me was using some sort of electronic device!Most people in groups have a smartphone, while half of the people that were alone have a tablet. I remember that a couple of years ago in the same situation, you were lucky to find one person with a tablet in a café. More users in Latam are moving to smartphones and tablets. Many are just adding one more device to their existing electronic devices portfolio. However, many users are leapfrogging directly into a tablet device, specially teenagers and kids.The tablet market has reached around 17M units in 2013, with a growth rate of approximately 120% (Couterpoint Research estimation). Growth for 2014, might not reach three digits, but still should be higher than 50%. Growth rates differ substantially among countries, so are their drivers and constraints.However, it's more subtle once you start digging into specific countries.The cost of false positives &gt;&gt; Laughing MemeI see Twitter getting beaten up a lot for not deleting the spammers faster. Etsy gets beaten up for not deleting the "resellers" faster. Flickr used to get yelled at for not catching the photo stealers or porn spammers faster."It's so fucking easy, they're right over there, here, let me show them to you, what's your problem?"This comes from not understanding the cost benefit ratio of false positives in identifying abuse of a social site at scale.Imagine you've got a near perfect model for detecting spammers on Twitter. Say, Joe's perfectly reasonable model of "20+ tweets that matched '^@[\w]+ http://'". Joe is (presumably hyperbolically) claiming 99% accuracy for his model. And for the moment we'll imagine he is right. Even at 99% accuracy, that means this algorithm is going to be incorrectly flagging roughly 2 million tweets per day as spam that are actually perfectly legitimate.If you've never run a social software site (which Joe of course has, but for the folks who haven't) let me tell you: these kinds of false positives are expensive.Read on to realise just how expensive.

Apple’s new 4G-capable iPad Air 2 has a software-based sim card, removing the need for the small white plastic card that mobile phone operators use to control access to their services.The new Apple sim in the iPad Air 2 means users in the US or UK do not need to get a sim card from a mobile phone providers, but can sign up directly for services from the device - and use the same sim in different countries with different providers.“The Apple sim gives you the flexibility to choose from a variety of short-term plans from selected carriers in the US and UK right there on your iPad,” wrote Apple on its site for the iPad Air 2.The move is a step closer to an entirely software-based sim for any country, which would give device buyers huge freedom in choosing their mobile supplier. The sim provides a subscriber’s unique ID and carries out the encrypted authentication to the network of that ID.In the US, most phones are sold “locked” to a specific network, thus tying the customer to the carrier even if they want to end their contract early. Despite moves by the US Congress to end phone locking, it is still prevalent - and keeps phone tariffs and prices high. Moving to a software-based sim could mean phone locking is easier to stop.EE, Sprint, T-mobile and AT&amp;T on-boardOwners of the new iPad Air 2 model with the built-in mobile phone connection can take out short term data plans with different mobile phone providers when needed, meaning that a long contract is not necessary.Presently only a few mobile phone providers are participating in the new technology, including EE in the UK, Sprint, T-mobile and AT&amp;T in the US.“The ‘Apple SIM’ is huge news. Shows the strength of Apple’s hand with carriers - no other manufacturer could have done that,” said Ben Wood, chief of researchfor CCS Insight.The new sim technology, which sits in the same slot as a regular nano-sim and can be swapped out, will allow travellers to use a local mobile phone network for mobile broadband without having to pre-order a new sim or purchase one in a shop on arrival, switching networks with settings on the iPad.Mobile phones using Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)-based networks in the US have had a similar system for years. But users have been unable to switch networks without the mobile phone provider issuing new software to the phone, normally for a fee. UK mobile phone networks use the rival Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) standard.The new technology could enable greater freedom in the mobile phone market by allowing customers to switch mobile phone networks on-the-fly, if and when a network provides better service or at lower cost.Having appeared in the iPad Air 2, the technology could next appear in 2015’s update to the iPhone line - and perhaps in future versions of the Apple Watch, as it would not need a slot for a physical sim.“Apple’s foray with ‘soft SIM’ in cellular iPads depicts the leverage and unprecedented power it has over carriers,”said Neil Shah, a mobile industry analyst with the analysis company Counterpoint Research. “Bringing soft sim to iPhone is not going to be as easy at global scale, nevertheless very important step to get it into iPads.”•iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 – the Apple event as it happened•Apple unveils iPad Air and iPad mini with Touch ID fingerprint scanner•Apple launches new iMac desktop with 27in retina displayThis article was updated at 10.55 on 17 October to clarify that the Apple sim is a separate removable sim card.
The New York state attorney general has issued the latest salvo in an ongoing battle between home-rental site Airbnb and regulators in its largest market, releasing a report in which he argues Airbnb has created a new kind of New York City real estate mogul – the commercial host.Some of the company’s top hosts make millions each year booking between dozens and hundreds of individual apartment units, taking them off the market for regular New Yorkers, the attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, argued in a report released on Thursday.The report “raises serious concerns about the proliferation of illegal hotels”, Schneiderman said in a statement. “We must ensure that, as online marketplaces revolutionise the way we live, laws designed to promote safety and quality-of-life are not forsaken under the pretext of innovation.”The attorney general’s report lays out an argument for why some of the site’s top hosts are gentrifying New York neighbourhoods, running illegal hotels, potentially avoiding millions in taxes and disturbing residential buildings. The attorney general also announced a joint enforcement committee, to find and shut down illegal hotels in the five boroughs.Schneiderman’s office analysed data subpoenaed from Airbnb in May, containing the anonymised transactions of 16,000 city hosts from 2010 through the first five months of 2014. Schneiderman’s office also obtained personal information about 100-plus hosts.The office found that the top host rented 272 unique units for revenue of more than $6.8m. Over those four years, the top 12 hosts made more than $24m combined.Around 40% of revenue, $187m, came from the Lower East Side and Chinatown, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen, and the Greenwich Village-SoHo areas. Many of those neighbourhoods had increasing numbers of units dedicated exclusively to short-term rentals. In Brooklyn, the trendy Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighbourhoods scooped up 10% of citywide revenue, generating $39m for hosts.Schneiderman’s report says as much as 72% of the site’s private listings, those rented while an occupant is gone, could be illegal, skirting as much as $33m in required hotel taxes.This is just the latest public relations move against Airbnb by Schneiderman. The two partieshashed out an agreement on the subpoena in a Manhattan trial-level court in May, but a fight for the hearts and minds of New Yorkers appears far from over. Over the summer, Airbnb plastered subways stations with ads.“New Yorkers agree: Airbnb is great for New York City,” the ads read. That assertion, however, appears far from universal. The ads were widely vandalised (as many in the city are), and a number of community groups have mounted an opposition to the company, saying that buildings are less safe and affordable when hordes of out-of-towners traipse through.Airbnb, however, maintains it’s just a proponent of the sharing economy that helps New Yorkers afford the city, providing an option to rent apartments while they’re not in use.The service has grown fantastically over the past four years – it now does tenfold the business it did in 2010, according to Schneiderman’s report. Hosts and Airbnb together are expected to rake in $282m this year.“We need to move forward,” spokesman Nick Papas said in an email to the Guardian. “We should not deny thousands of New Yorkers the chance to share their homes, pay their bills and stay in the city they love. We need to work together on some sensible rules that stop bad actors and protect regular people who simply want to share the home in which they live.”Before handing data over to Schneiderman’s office, the company removed some 2,000 New York City listings from its site, calling them “bad actors”. Schneiderman’s analysis of Airbnb’s data didn’t take into account these removed listings, Airbnb said.While Airbnb dukes out its right to rent in New York, it’s scoring high-profile victories elsewhere: the San Francisco board of supervisors recentlylegalised short-term rentals.Airbnb is a private, San Francisco-based companylast valued at $2.7bn.

Apple has released a new version of its iMac desktop computer at an event in California, with a 27in retina display marking its first significant update since 2011. It will go on sale today, starting at $2,499.The new iMac brings the high resolution retina display – first introduced on the iPhone and iPad, then the MacBook Pro in 2012 – to the desktop. The “retina 5K” display will have a native resolution of 5120x2880 pixels, leading to a 14.7 megapixel display.That boosts the resolution and pixel density, but in keeping with Apple’s approach to mobile devices, it uses it to make text, icons and pictures sharper and easier to read, rather than simply making everything much smaller and adding more screen real estate.The new iMac maintains the slim all-aluminium design, introduced in 2011 along with Apple’s Thunderbolt port for fast external connections, while the internals are upgraded with a 3.5Ghz quad-core Intel i7 and an AMD Radeon R9 M290X graphics card.The new retina display with 14.7 megapixels.The original iMac launched in 1998 as Apple’s modern design-led all-in-one computer, combining computer and screen into one device. It was also Apple’s chief designer Jony Ive’s first big creation for the company, based around an original tube TV monitor and polycarbonate body.Since 1998 the iMac has seen several revisions, moving to an articulated flat screen in 2002 and then to the basis for the current aluminium bodies in 2004. Apple continued to update the iMac internally, switching to Intel processors from IBM Power PCs in 2006.The iMac has steadily replaced the Mac Pro as the machine used by most desktop Mac users, including publishers and artists, with only video producers clinging to the more expensive, but more powerful Mac Pro.•Apple unveils iPad Air and iPad mini with Touch ID fingerprint scanner•Apple releases newest version of Mac OS, Yosemite, for download•Apple Pay launches in US
Apple has unveiled two new iPads at an event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, includinga new, thinner and more powerful iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3, both with with Touch ID fingerprint sensors.The new iPad Airs run an A8X chip, with increased performance on last year’s models: According to the company’s hardware lead, Phil Schiller, the processor is 40% faster and the graphics are 2.5x faster graphics.While the screens on the devices remain the same size, at 9.7in and 7.9in, the new iPad Air 2 is just 6.1mm, an 18% reduction on the iPad Air. The device also has a new screen with 58% less reflectivity, and an improved 8 megapixel camera. The iPad Mini 3 sees its own update, getting the fingerprint sensor, but otherwise retaining the same internals as the original iPad Air.Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner was first introduced with the iPhone 5S, released in September 2013, but was not fitted to the iPad Air or iPad mini with Retina display released in November later that year.It is used to unlock the device and as a password replacement for purchases through the App Store and iTunes. It will also be able to authenticate purchases through Apple’s new mobile payment service Apple Pay, for goods and services online.Both new iPads now come with more storage for apps, games, movies, photos and music with 16, 64 and 128GB options available, for $499, $599 and $699 respectively for the Air and $399, $499 and $599 for the mini, as well as versions with cellular connectivity for $130 more. Apps and games have increased in size dramatically over the last couple of years with many taking up well over 500MB of space.The company will also continue selling both previous iPad minis, and the old iPad Air, leading to an entry price of just $249. The new devices will be available to pre-order from Friday.Touch ID is the most requested feature on the iPad, Apple saidSales of iPads have slowed dramatically in the first half of 2014, and fallen year-on-year for two quarters in succession. Apple will be looking to tempt business users with its new devices and a deal with IBM, signed in July, which could be crucial to reviving flagging sales.But the company was still happily promoting its total sales of 225m iPads since the product line began in 2010, and Cook boasted of iPads outselling every PC sold by typical manufacturers such as Dell and Lenovo in the last 12 months.Data from research firm Gartner indicates tablets will represent less than 10% of all computers, tablets and smartphones in 2014, and will continue to decrease through 2018 as consumers cool on buying new tablets, replacing them far more slowly than they do their smartphones.Apple’s iPad is currently used by the NHS, publishers and other office-based industries, where it is often used instead of a laptop – with increased security, battery life and portability for a lesser cost than laptop alternatives.•Apple launches new iMac desktop with 27in retina display•Apple releases newest version of Mac OS, Yosemite, for download•Apple Pay launches in US
Apple released its new operating systems for mobile and desktop computers on Thursday, announcing iOS 8.1 for iPad and iPhone as well as iOS X 10.10 Yosemite.On stage in Cupertino, California, Apple chief executive Tim Cook introduced both updates, which will be available for free. Yosemite is available from Thursday, and 8.1 will be available from Monday.Leading the charge was Yosemite’s “continuity” feature, which allows users to easily switch between their desktops and smartphones whenever they want to. It includes an expansion to the already existing AirDrop software, letting users send files back and forth between iPhones and Macs.Yosemite also improves tethering, which allows users to connect their laptop to the internet via their iPhone. Continuity also allows users of both Macs and iPhones to send and receive texts and phone calls from their computer, even to and from those without iPhones.There are also updates to the Mail, Spotlight, and Safari apps, in addition to a whole new cloud-syncing service called iCloud Drive, a competitor to other services such as Dropbox, letting you share files and folders directly through Finder, Apple’s file manager.An updated Spotlight allows for web searches and searching for locations in the real world using Bing as its default search, further distancing Apple from Google’s services. Updates to the company’s iWork suite were also announced.Mail will now let users send attachments of up to 5GB through Apple’s servers if the recipient can’t receive the file directly. Safari has a new ‘favourites’ view, which gives you access to the most visited websites, as well as separate private browsing windows and built-in support for DuckDuckGo, a non-tracking search engine.Alongside Yosemite, Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering, addressed iOS 8, revealing that the new mobile operating system had been downloaded by 48% of iOS users in the 28 days since launch, and introduced iOS 8.1“When we put a piece of software in the hands of hundreds of millions of users, we do get a bit of feedback,” Federighi joked, before announcing the improvements to be added in the point update.

The service will also be integrated with the company’s upcoming Apple Watch and iPad Air 2.Users scan and add a card to their iPhone, which can then make payments online and offline at retailers including McDonalds, Whole Foods and Disney’s theme parks.As well as giving a launch date, Cook announced a large expansion in support for the service, both at the banks’ and the merchants’ end. “Just since last month, we have signed another 500 banks. They will be rolling out support later this year and next year … we’ve got a lot of great apps and a lot of great developers.”Cue highlighted the security and privacy benefits of the service in his introduction. The technology behind Apple Pay involves sending the merchant a single-use token with which they approve the payment. Unlike a credit card number, which provides all the information required to make future payments, a merchant can’t re-use the token later – and neither can someone who steals the information.The service will also integrate with Apple’s TouchID fingerprint sensors. Before a payment can be sent, users must authenticate themselves with their devices. As an additional security measure, Apple Pay can be deactivated remotely using the company’s Find My iPhone service.On privacy, Cue wasted no opportunity to swipe at rival Google: “We don’t store the credit card number, and we don’t give it to the merchant … We’re not in the business of collecting your data.”The company doesn’t store where users spend their money, what they bought, “or any other details”.Analysts praised the service as a good move, but cautioned that the overall success of Apple Pay depended on how quickly the company could roll it out overseas.“Apple Pay will offer a huge demand reinforcement benefit for Apple devices, further strengthening the Apple ecosystem,” said Geoff Blaber, vice president at analyst firm CCS Insight. “The extent of this benefit will depend on how quickly it can roll out beyond the US. This will be a complex task due to the fragmented nature of markets in regions such as Europe, and is likely to take some considerable time and investment. Nonetheless, this will be an area of considerable focus for Apple over the coming years given the significant long-term ecosystem benefits.”•Apple launches new iMac desktop with 27in retina display•Apple unveils iPad Air and iPad mini with Touch ID fingerprint scanner•Apple releases newest version of Mac OS, Yosemite, for download
Will.i.am has got in ahead of Apple with the launch of a smartwatch, Puls, the first in a planned line of wearable gadgets from his company i.am+.The device was unveiled at the Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, and besides telling the time, tracks activity, plays music, offers GPS navigation and accesses a range of social networks.Puls can also make voice calls and send texts, with its own SIM card and partnerships with AT&amp;T in the US and O2 in the UK – although owners will be able to use “mirrored” SIM cards with the same account as their smartphone, rather than having to sign up to an extra mobile tariff.All this may sound like a smartwatch, but US journalists at the Dreamforce event reported that the Black Eyed Peas star prefers to describe the Android-based device as a “cuff” because,as he told Gizmodo, “watches don’t have SIM cards”.Will.i.am’s wearable ambitions go beyond the Puls, though. He’s also planning to launch a jacket capable of providing power to the device, a backpack with built-in speakers, and shoes tracking their owner’s weight and steps.He’s pitching i.am+ as the latest crossover between the technology and fashion worlds. “They’re too disciplines that haven’t been disciplined to collaborate. Two worlds so caught up in their awesomeness that they don’t want to collaborate,” he told Gizmodo.“I sit in the middle. I love fashion – that’s what I went to school for –but I love technology. That’s what I’m telling kids to go to school for.”Several companies are involved in Puls as partners, including Nuance, which worked with i.am+’s team on a virtual assistant feature called AneedA – the Puls’ equivalent of Apple’s Siri, capable of tasks including taking dictation to send texts, controlling music and scheduling calendar appointments.British firm 7digital, meanwhile, is running the digital music service that comes with the Puls, with users able to download tracks to the device and play them – through headphones and backpack speakers alike. Instagram, Facebook and Twitter will all be present as apps.For now, neither Will.i.am nor his mobile operator partners are revealing the price or launch date for the device, althoughTechCrunch reportsthat it will be less than the cost of a SIM-free iPhone, although that could mean up to £789 in the UK, based on the 128GB model of the iPhone 6 Plus.Will.i.am will be hoping for more success with the Puls than the first product launched through i.am+, thefoto-sosho iPhone camera case. It launched in the UK in December 2012, and the US the following year, but received a lukewarm critical response.Still, he has his finger in a number of other technological pies in 2014. In January, he was named chief creative officer of 3D printing company 3D Systems, working with the firm and Coca-Cola on itsEkocycle Cube printer, which was unveiled in June.In the past, he explored social media through a site called Dipdive in 2008, and launched his own app development firm Will.i.apps in 2011, with the latter releasing a music video app for the Black Eyed Peas.He was also an early investor in Beats Electronics, which saw him make a handsome – if as yet undisclosed – profit when the company was bought by Apple for $3bn earlier this year.With Puls, he’ll now be competing directly with Apple, which is due to release its first smartwatch in early 2015, as well as with a range of manufacturers making devices running Google’s Android Wear software.•Will.i.am: ‘the music industry is delusional’
Publishers have urged Google to reveal more about how it decides what information to remove from its search results under the “right to be forgotten” at a public event in London.The search company is running a series of public consultations across Europe discussing its implementation of a controversial European court ruling granting the right for people to ask for inaccurate, irrelevant or outdated information about them to be removed from search results.Speaking to an advisory council led by Google’s executive chairman Eric Schmidt, speakers from the Guardian and BBC raised cases of news reports being affected by Google’s removals with very little explanation.David Jordan, the BBC’s Director of Policy and Standards, said BBC content including trial reports of real IRA members had been affected by Google’s decision to remove search results.He also raised the issue of content unrelated to removal requests being de-indexed because people had the same name as those who had requested search results be removed.Jordan urged Google to provide publishers with much more information as to how they made their decisions, describing a “lack of formal appeal process and lack of information about the search terms that have been disabled”.He also stated that publishers should be informed in advance when Google was considering removing links to their content, so as to give a chance to weigh in on the decision.Chris Moran, the Guardian’s digital audience editor, echoed many of the same concerns, raising details of a series of articles relating to the harassment of a public figure – who he did not name – which had been removed under the ruling with no detailed explanation from Google.“My recommendation would be: engage, engage with us about the removal of individual links,” he said. “I’ve moved to a position that each case needs to be evaluated on case-by-case basis.”Google established itsadvisory councilon the right to be forgotten, which includes outside figures such as Wikipedia’s Jimmy Wales and Sylvie Kauffmann of Le Monde, in response to criticism of its early decisions on the right to be forgotten, which includedremoving and then reinstatinga series of articles relating to a Scottish referee who lied about his reasons for granting a penalty.Google’s final public meeting of its advisory council will take place in Brussels on 4 November.•Google’s grand European tour aims to map out the future of data ethics
In January 2010, as Steve Jobs showed off the first iPad, the question that many asked was: what is it for? Why would people want a tablet that couldn’t run Windows desktop apps, as Microsoft had assumed they would when it first pushed the form factor in the early 2000s?Four years later, the answer seems clear - though the answer might not be much comfort at first to Tim Cook, Jobs’s successor. In many cases, tablets including iPads have replaced the TV set, becoming a mobile form of entertainment that’s a lot more convenient than a portable DVD player, and with a far better screen.Overall, tablet ownership has rocketed from a standing start. In the US, 44% of households had one in January 2014,according to Pew Internet; Ofcom foundthe same figureat the same time.But shipments have stalled. After enjoying 78% and 68% growth in 2012 and 2013, tablet shipments have slowed dramatically, so that Apple has seen year-on-year falls in tablet shipments in the first six months of 2014, and is likely to report another for the three months o the end of September when it reports results later this month. As a market, tablet sales are forecast to grow only 6.5% in 2014, according to IDC, a research company.So as Cook prepares to unveil the successor to last year’s super-thin, light iPad Air, questions are being asked about the entire tablet category. Gartner, another research company, reckons that this year tablets will have made up less than 10% of device sales - mobile phones, PCs and tablets.In part that’s because mobile phone sales are so gigantic - 1.8bn total including basic featurephones. Tablet sales are forecast to be 229m this year, up from 207m in 2013, rising to 272m in 2015; that would put them past “traditional” PCs (desktops and laptops), which Gartner says will shift 276m this year and fall to 261m in 2015.By Gartner’s measure, though, sales of PC-like “ultramobiles” - like Microsoft’s Surface, with detachable keyboards - will rise from 37m to 64m in the same time, which gives the total “PC” market a lead over tablets. This depends on definitions; IDC, a rival research firm, puts ultramobiles into “tablets”, and so has them overtaking PCs more quickly.Brand strugglesIt’s not only Apple that is struggling. The tablet market has been brutally competitive from the start, but only Apple and Samsung – which supplied the screen for the first iPads and was among the first to market with Android tablets in autumn 2010 - have maintained significant share. It’s not clear how well Samsung is faring financially: at the launch of its latest top-end tablet, executives intimated that if this didn’t sell well, they would instead begin chasing the low-end market.For the rest, much of the market is consumed by low-priced Chinese-made “white box” tablets, which appear largely to be used to watch video content – either on YouTube, or “sideloaded” from computers. That would bolster the statistic quoted at Google I/O by Sundar Pichai, who said that Android tablets made up 42% of YouTube viewing - in line with the installed base of tablets.“The tablet market is separating into two - the branded side, which is slowing, and the low-cost which is continuing to grow,” says Neil Mawston of Strategy Analytics, a global research company. “The branded side is struggling because it’s already taken the low-hanging fruit of people who had netbooks, who moved swiftly to tablets.”Tablet shipment data by vendor, 2Q 2010 - 2Q 2014. Source: IDC.Photograph: Guardian/IDCThe question of what people do with tablets seemed to be answered, at least in part, by Ofcom last week, in a report which found thattablets were replacing TVs in the bedroom, with a third of children having their own, and over 60% having access to one at home. Half of those tablets were iPads, according to eMarketer.That speaks to a dramatically fast uptake of tablets. According to data collected by Horace Dediu, who runs the Asmyco consultancy, tablet adoption in the US has been faster than for any previous technology, including the smartphone, refrigerator or car.But the problem facing Apple, and evident in its sales statistics, is that tablets don’t wear out as quickly as PCs, and if they’re principally used to watch video, they’re not as susceptible to forced upgrade cycles: social network apps and YouTube work as well on a four-year-old tablet as a brand new one.“People have worked out what they want really do with tablets, and whether they really need one,” says Francisco Jeronimo, smartphone and tablet analyst for IDC. “The thing is, if you’ve got a big smartphone, it’s running the same apps, then the tablet is the same except in most cases it hasn’t got a mobile connection. There’s no real way the tablet can really replace the laptop.” That leaves growth at the cheaper, smaller-screened segment, where parents and schools buy for children, he suggests.Apple isn’t, however, interested in cutting prices and hence profit margins in order to retain its market share. Instead, it is looking around for new customers that are willing to pay its prices. The most obvious untapped ones: businesses.Big Blue dealSo far, consumers’ eager adoption of tablets hasn’t been matched by businesses, where tablet uptake has been slower as they consider the possible benefits of products like the Surface, with its detachable keyboard and desktop chip. But Cook has a plan there: in the summer Apple announced a deal with IBM, where “Big Blue”, usually known for mainframes and services, will begin pushing iPads and iPhones together with custom software as part of full service deals with its bigger customers.“Apple has done well in terms of persuading some board-level executives in various companies to adopt iPads, and the price point makes it easier for enterprises to afford than a low-income consumer,” says Tim Coulling, senior analyst at Canalys. “With IBM, I expect they will go after vertical markets - specialist uses such as healthcare, retail point of sale, and so on.”But, Coulling adds, it’s still early days for the tablet in the business world. “Businesses are always slow to adopt new technology - look at how slowly they’re moving with Windows.” Indeed, the PC market’s uplift earlier this year was largely ascribed to companies replacing machines running Windows XP, last updated in 2008.Won’t those enterprise customers want something special? Such as a larger tablet? Rumours that Apple will make a bigger tablet - up to 12in diagonally - have swirled for months. As is standard, the company hasn’t commented, but expectations of a “Pro” tablet have some interested, even as others question whether it would take sales away from the Macbook line of computers.JP Gownder of Forrester Research says: “an improved iPad Air is a certainty, and a 12.9” iPad would be a competitor to the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 - and to the Mac.”Cannibalising the MacWould Apple introduce a tablet that might hurt its laptop line? It’s never been reluctant to cannibalise its own lines: the iPad arguably subtracted from Mac sales, but Apple executives have repeatedly argued that there are more PCs to steal sales from than Macs (which have a 5% share of PC sales, though steadily rising as that market shrinks). The “phablet”-sized iPhone 6 Plus with its 5.5in screen will surely subtract from sales of the 7in iPad mini - but Apple won’t mind, because it makes more profit on the 6 Plus, and gets a customer who is likely to go for a two-year replacement cycle, rather than the three years of a tablet. So the possibility of a bigger iPad - and perhaps productivity enhancements such as split-screen apps - seems strong.Even so, as Cook prepares to take the stage in California to announce the new tablets - and new notebooks, and perhaps some entirely new category - the tablet market is in the doldrums for two simple reasons: most of the consumers who want one already have one, and businesses aren’t sure yet if they want one - or one thousand, or none.“I don’t see the IBM deal having much impact before next year,” says Jeronimo. “Apple will need to do something unique, perhaps tying it in with the Apple TV [set-top box], doing something in software and services. But this is definitely a very difficult time for Apple.”Steve Jobs might have thought that explaining the benefits of the iPad was tough. But four years after the first one, it seems that explaining the benefits of a replacement iPad - or a new one - could be even tougher.•Apple upstages its own launch as details of new iPads appear online•Apple’s Jony Ive: copying designs is ‘lazy thieving’
It’s a myth that has been perpetuated since the early days of hacktivist crews Anonymous and LulzSec: hardcore hacking is now as simple as downloading some software and clicking a few buttons.As a hack who has covered the hacker world for some years, your reporter felt it was time to find out whether that myth is true: to get dirty and learn about the more intricate parts of what the pros and hardened cyber criminals do day in, day out.At the end of it, I’d know how to crack Wi-Fi, have websites cough up their databases and break into people’s online accounts, all without breaking the law. It was a quietly thrilling experience. And yet I’d come away feeling somewhat inadequate, having silently marvelled at the technical aptitude of my humble tutors.Is hardcore hacking easy now? There’s a modicum of truth to this. After two days on site with some professional hackers, it was apparent that simple tricks could be picked up quickly by the average computer user.But acquiring real understanding of software vulnerabilities and how to exploit them would take more than 16 hours solid learning. It didn’t take long to realise security can be hard for those who deal largely in abstractions or operate at one remove from the action they believe themselves to be part of (yes, journalists included).It had all started so well, with high-level concepts that I was already au fait with. Thomas Mackenzie, a Leeds United-obsessed pro hacker (or ethical hacker, or whitehat, or penetration tester – take your pick) from security consultancy NCC Group, took to the whiteboard to do a refresher onHTTP requests and responses.These form the unseen, underlying way browsing the internet works. Within them are request methods, of which the two most common are GET and POST. There are various differences between the two, but at the most basic level, GET sees data requested from a specified source, whereas POST submits data to be processed.Where websites contain vulnerabilities, it’s possible to mess with these requests and the client-server model in general to crack open websites and raid them of all their digital goodies.This is where BurpSuite, the most fundamental tool for any web hacker, be they benevolent or sinister, comes into play. Burp intercepts communications between the PC, tablet or whatever client device is being used and the server, so penetration testers can tamper with the data being sent back and forth to see what breaks.It has a handy tool called Repeater, which can take a request stored in history and replay it over and over until the user has uncovered some hidden weakness in the site they’re playing with (it soon becomes apparent that much of a penetration tester’s work involves lots of trial and error, many highly educated guesses and constant cat and mouse shenanigans … though they get paid rather well, either through their wage or the rewards they receive for finding bugs. Mackenzie tells of one that earned him a cool £15,000).Perran Hill: ethical hacker from NCC Group.After a primer on Burp, we had our first practical lesson. I’d already set up a virtual machine (an operating system within an operating system) running Kali Linux – the de facto OS of penetration testers. There are a host oftutorialsonline that show how to get hold of both those software products.Next we had to find a suitable target, one that wouldn’t call the lawyers as soon as we started doing bad things. For any wannabe hacker, there are myriad free testing platforms on which to try out attacks, one of which does exactly what it says on the tin: Damn Vulnerable Web App, which Mackenzie has contributed to in the past and was created by his old whitehat buddy Ryan Dewhurst. It has three difficulty settings: low, medium and hard. Obviously, we went with the lowest.With Mackenzie and colleague Perran Hill, we’d try to break the site using a technique known as SQL injection, one of the most common attacks used by crooks today. This involves finding an area of the site where users can enter information, such as a login form, or a form to collect a user’s details, that the web server then checks against a type of database generically known as SQL. The aim is to trick the site into coughing up all the information from that database.The SQL injection task for the Damn Vulnerable Web App simply presents a user ID box. From this alone I’m tasked with finding a vulnerability. To start, I’m told to enter anything. I enter 1. This returns some information on the screen, telling me user 1 is the admin. Nothing more.Some very basic knowledge of SQL’s workings now comes in handy. When I typed in 1, the website took that input as its parameter and asked the database to select all users where the name was 1. Ultimately, I wanted the database to accept parameters it shouldn’t and reveal more about what it contained. “You need something that is syntactically correct but not what it’s designed to do,” Hill says.To figure out what was correct, I’d have to find out what was wrong. I started by adding an apostrophe after the 1. This returned an error – good news for the hacker as errors often provide useful information about the target system. I then added another apostrophe. No error. It had simply negated the odd use of the previous apostrophe, or “rebalanced” it, as my tutors put it. This was done in order to “break out” of the expected syntax to determine how the database was working.One typical tactic is to send the website a true statement such as 1=1. Typing something like “‘Thomas’ or 1=1 --” would ask the database to return users called Thomas or everything else. (Take note that typing this kind of code into websites can cause things to break, so don’t try this at home. In fact, don’t try any of these techniques on sites you haven’t got permission to abuse.)If it offered up more information, this would likely indicate a vulnerability. Rather than go down the path of manually exploiting the bug, entering more SQL syntax and overloading my tiny mind palace, we chose to run the infamous sqlmap tool in Kali Linux against the database. This would automatically find and exploit weaknesses from which we could extract data.Having navigated my way to certain areas of the Damn Vulnerable Web App and some internal NCC testing sites, launching sqlmap at various pieces of them I’d copied into a file, I finally launched an exploit against a database and retrieved some passwords.All were protected by a hash – a one-way cryptographic function for turning text into unreadable nonsense. But the plain text for some of them could easily be found by simply copy and pasting them into Google, as they’d already been cracked in previous breaches. For the rest, it was time to turn to password cracker John (that’s the name of the tool, not another one of NCC’s security boffs).It’s an incredibly basic password cracking tool that simply guesses at credentials, running a dictionary of passwords as fast as it can through the relevant hashing algorithm and comparing them to the hashes provided. Though this is done thousands of times a second, it’s still slow when compared to more advanced tools.This is why John won’t break really strong passwords – ones with plenty of letters, characters, special characters and numbers – in any short period of time. You need extreme computer power to carry out enough guesses (known as brute forcing) to crack really good passwords.That means buying a load of high-powered processor units, or just renting someone else’s systems for as little as $2 an hour, as with Project Mars, run by security firmPraetorian.John didn’t get the job done for me. And by that time, with my brain suitably drained, it was the end of day one. SQL injection nailed. Sort of.Learning to hack involved hardware as well as software.Day two would be entirely hands-on. We started with cross-site scripting (XSS), which, for whatever reason, I was rather adept at. Though the praise was too high for a novice, Mackenzie even described me as an “XSS master”. XSS is, alongside SQL injection, one of the most prevalent forms of attack on the internet today. It sees the attacker place rogue JavaScript code on a website in the hope it will be executed by the user’s browser. That code will attempt to steal digital things from the browser, such as session cookies, which would grant the attacker access to accounts the victim has logged into, and send them on to the hacker’s own computer.Again, we moved to a mock site where I was tasked with passing different levels. The ultimate aim was to get hold of one of those tasty cookies. The final level I attempted was the trickiest. We were presented with a plain site and a link that pointed to a chat area, where a lady called Joanne asked us if we needed help. She soon would …We had to get her to execute our bad code, which would involve having her machine enter a value into the chat form and click on the submit button. This involved slightly more complex JavaScript than the standard “&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;”, which is what hackers often try first to see if a vulnerability is present.Code such as ”document.getelementbyid(chat).value=Thomas” forced Joanne’s machine to write out Thomas in the chat area and then ”document.GetElementById(chatsubmit).submit.click()” would submit that message.Adding the document.cookie command had her hand over her session cookie. Though we didn’t get round to it, we could easily have added a ”document.location” piece of code to push the cookie to our own IP address.Next up was Wi-Fi. Hill had lovingly ripped apart an old router with shoddy encryption so we could easily hack it (though I was largely a spectator). For this, we’d need a USB Wi-Fi card (we used an Alfa card with the RTL8187 chipset). This would be put into monitor mode so we could start passively monitoring the airwaves for local Wi-Fi signals.Various channels popped up. We would select the one using a broken encryption standard known as WEP, known to be exploitable as it leaks information about the cryptographic keys it uses.Essentially, the key can be derived from the datastream produced by all the different connections going through the router – the more data we collected from the network, the easier it would be to break the encryption. To gather that information, we entered ”airodump-ng --encrypt WEP –channel 11 –w &lt;filename&gt; --ics”. It was then simply a matter of waiting and collecting the packets from the air.Once we had enough information (in this case around 10,000 packets), we saved it all in a file and ran it through aircrack. This would give us the password used to “secure” the WEP Wi-Fi access point.“I was at once elated and deflated... there was so much left to learn”Finally, we looked at scanning an internal corporate network, using the nmap tool, another critical weapon in a hardcore hacker’s arsenal. First, my masters gave me a recap of how standard TCP/IP communications worked using theso-called “three-way handshake”. First the computer would send a SYN notification to a server, which would respond with a SYNACK. Finally, there would be an ACK from the computer.In nmap, it’s possible to probe numerous remote ports – which allow for machines located anywhere to speak with each other via ”sockets” – by replicating these connection attempts. With a simple ”-sT” command in the interface and a set of IP addresses, this will reveal which ports accept outside interaction and are therefore potential targets. It’s possible to specify which ports you want to scan too, using a command such as ”-p1”.Scans can be far more aggressive, however. The ”-A” option within nmap throws a bunch of protocol specific queries at a target port, from brute forcing of passwords to reporting back vulnerabilities, running services and detailed version numbers. This can then all be recorded to file for possible future attacks with the ”-oA” command. I could do all this for any machine connected to the web. Ah, the power!Day two was done and the attempt at learning to be a hacker in an infinitesimal amount of time – in comparison to the years professionals spend honing their skills – was done. I had finally got into the nitty-gritty of all the tools and techniques I had understood but never seen put into action firsthand.It really was possible to pick up some high-level hacking skills in a very short period of time, meaning anyone could do it, with the right resources to hand. This all comes with its positive and negative connotations. Those skills could easily be put to criminal use. It depends entirely on the scrupulousness of those with the knowledge.Yet it was apparent there was a vast amount I didn’t know. Though I could carry out a handful of attacks, I wasn’t sure of precisely what my actions were doing to the underlying systems. It felt wrong somehow.On the walk back through the monotonous suburbia of Leatherhead towards a London-bound train, I was at once elated and deflated. Despite being riddled with anxiety over the purpose of a humanities-led education, when software development or anything computer science-related would have given me a more propitious start in working life, I left my masters not completely bereft of hope.There was one significant reason not to get overwhelmed by inferiority: there was so much left to learn.
Technology policy is increasingly pitched as a zero-sum game: where London wins, it must do so by stealing startups and talent from Silicon Valley, New York, or Tel Aviv – or so conventional wisdom goes.But that might be a needlessly combative attitude, according to a partner at one of Europe’s leading venture capital firms.Saul Klein, a partner of Swiss venture capital firm Index Ventures, says that the best-placed tech firms are increasingly international from day one. They’ll launch an office in a second country before they’ve even left the co-working space they were founded in.“The best entrepreneurs tap in to any and all” of the various ecosystems, from London to Tel Aviv and San Francisco to New York, Klein says.“If you’re starting a company in Copenhagen, like ZenDesk, those guys got on a plane and moved to San Fransicso. And now they’re a $1bn company. You have other companies like Criteo, probably one of the most successful tech IPOs in the last ten years: they grew up in Paris, moved to the UK, moved to the Valley, moved to Japan, and now they’re a multi-national doing business across the board.“I think the best companies take a journey that taps into this global ecosystem.”Klein’s comments contrast with those of policymakers, who are focused on building the capital up as the best place to start a business.In 2013, Boris Johnson launched the Million Pound Startup competition, aimed at enticing promising businesses to London. Described as “a new, groundbreaking global competition to bring a high-growth technology company to London”, it offered £1m to the winner, as long as they moved their HQ to the capital.But by this year,the competition had been abandoned, with one judge admitting that “In the end it proved difficult to find companies that had both the right level of ambition and could stand a valuation for £2m-£10m.”For Klein, London is already a big enough player to stand as a necessary part of any company – but it’s silly to try and compete with Silicon Valley on its own terms.“Talking about the Bay Area, there’s more capital, there are more corporate clients, there are more forward-thinking academic institutions, there’s just more of everything, in orders of magnitude. It’s been going for 60 years and I can’t believe that that’s necessarily going to change in my lifetime, or even my children’s lifetimes.”But just because everything in San Francisco is bigger and better, Klein cautions against start ups “jumping on a plane” in the hope that “money falls from trees”. “There’s more money, but more people going after it. The standard to which those people are held is as high – if not higher.”Index Ventures started in Geneva in 1996, before expanding to London and San Francisco. The firm has been an early investor in firms such as Dropbox, Etsy, and Skype, where Klein himself worked shortly before joining the venture capital firm.Boris Johnson hits back at Merkel broadband jibe
