Facebook-owned virtual reality firm Oculus VR has sold more than 100,000 of its Oculus Rift headset’s developer kits, but the social network’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is aiming much higher.“It needs to reach a very large scale – 50 million to 100 million units – before it will really be a meaningful thing as a computing platform,” hetold analysts during Facebook’s earnings callfollowing the publication of its latest quarterly financial results.Zuckerberg added that this is a long-term target for Oculus VR, whichFacebook bought for $2bnearlier in 2014.“It’s hard to predict exactly but I don’t think it’s going to get to 50 million or 100 million units in the next few years. So that will take a few cycles of the device to get there,” he said during the earnings call.“And then when you get to that scale, that’s when it starts to be interesting as a business in terms of developing out the ecosystem. So when I’m talking about that as a 10 year thing, it’s building the first set of devices and building the audience and the ecosystem around that until it eventually becomes a business.”Oculus Rift isn’t a consumer product yet: the company has released two prototypes so far for games developers, while also announcinga partnership with Samsung for its Gear VR device.“We continue to see a lot of excitement in the developer community and we’ve now shipped more than 100,000 of Rift developer kit to over a 130 countries,” Zuckerberg told analysts.“It’s still early for Oculus but we are encouraged to see the variety of apps and games being developed for this platform.”Zuckerberg has already made it clear that his ambitions for virtual reality go well beyond games, even if they remain the focus for Oculus VR in the short term.“After games, we’re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face – just by putting on goggles in your home,” hewrote in a status updateas the acquisition was announced in March.“This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures.”•Facebook closes its $2bn Oculus Rift acquisition. What next?
Google is working on a nanoparticle pill that could identify cancers, heart attacks and other diseases before they become a problem.The pill would contain magnetic particles approximately 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. These tiny particles will have antibodies or proteins attached to them that detect the presence of “biomarker” molecules inside the body that indicate diseases such as cancer or an imminent heart attack.“Essentially the idea is simple; you just swallow a pill with the nano particles, which are decorated with antibodies or molecules that detect other molecules,” explained Andrew Conrad, head of life sciences inside the Google’s “moonshot” X research lab toWSJD Live conference in California Tuesday. “They course through your body and because the cores of these particles are magnetic, you can call them somewhere and ask them what they saw.”‘Hey, what did you see?’Conrad explained that the particles would be analogous to sending thousands of doctors down into the population of a large city to monitor what is going on with individuals, describing current medical techniques as having one doctor fly over the city it in a helicopter trying to see what’s causing issues with individual people.“If you look at your wrist you can see these superficial veins – just by putting a magnet there you can trap [the nanoparticles],” Conrad said explaining that a wrist-worn device like a smartwatch could be used to read what the particles have detected on their trip through the blood stream.“We ask them: Hey, what did you see? Did you find cancer? Did you see something that looks like a fragile plaque for a heart attack? Did you see too much sodium?” said Conrad.The system known as the “nanoparticle platform” is Google’s latest venture into the lucrative health market, which is worth around 10% of the economy of developed nations. More than £100bn a year is spent on the National Health Service in Britain.Pre-emptive rather than reactiveIt is part of the move away from reactive medicine, which treats diseases once they have become serious enough to cause symptoms for patients prompting them to go and see a doctor and towards pre-emptive medicine, which catches signs of disease much earlier, before it becomes a problem.Pre-emptive or proactive medicine will require new ways of monitoring the normal health of individuals so that changes, even small ones, can be detected. Google’s“Baseline” health studyunveiled in July is part of this effort and another project from Google’s X lab, which now has a team of around 100 scientists, including Conrad, who was the chief scientific officer of a diagnostics lab firm LabCorp, which previously developed a cheap test for HIV.The work is at very early stages – Google currently hasn’t discovered how many nanoparticles would be required to make the system effective and has to develop coatings for the particles that help them bind to cells to detect issues. The scheme is being made public as Google is now seeking partners to take the technology forward.Conrad said it would not be Google operating the technology, and that the search giant would not be the one with access to the data collected by the nanoparticles. Instead it would be the patients doctors, hospitals and medical equipment companies that take the technology on.“It’d be like saying GE is in control of your X-ray,” quipped Conrad. “We are the creators of the tech and they are the disseminators.”Nanotechnology is a new field in medical science, which has promised to helpcombat disease including cancer. But nanoparticles potentially pose a risk to thehealth of individualsandthe environmentif not carefully controlled, which could build up and cause unintended consequences in unexpected places both inside the body and in the wider environment.Medical applications of new diagnostic technologies like this are highly regulated, and Google could face tough challenges in proving the safety and efficacy of the nanoparticle platform. It is highly likely that a medical company would partner with Google to take the technology to the next step, but that next step is likely to be more than five years away according to industry experts.One of Google’s previous X lab projects, a“smart” contact lenscapable of monitoring the signs of diabetes, was licensed by Swiss drug firm Novartis in July to develop the technology into a practical medical application.•Google calls for guinea pigs for ambitious ‘Baseline’ health study•Google launches Fit app to take on Apple’s Heath and Samsung’s S Health
Mobile phone records could provide more accurate and up-to-date information than traditional census methods for keeping track of populations around the world, according to new research.They could even be used to help tackle crisis situations such as the spread of Ebola, a report said.A study by an international team, including the University of Southampton, has found that maps made using mobile records are detailed, reliable and flexible enough to help inform infrastructure and emergency planners particularly in low income countries, where recent population density information is often scarce.The Southampton geographer and senior author on the study, Dr Andy Tatem, said: “Proving the resilience and accuracy of using mobile phone records to map populations was crucial for us, as it has many advantages over traditional census information.“At the moment mapping of populations is constrained by the logistics of census surveys, which just provide a single snapshot of population distributions every 10 years.“However, anonymous phone data can be examined regularly to map daily, weekly or monthly changes across an entire country, at less cost and with greater flexibility.“Every time a person uses a mobile it sends information to a receiving tower and gives an approximate location of where they are. When this information is repeated multiple times, over millions of users, we can extract a detailed picture of population density and how it changes over time in a given area.”The team, led by the Universite catholique de Louvain and the Universite libre de Bruxelles and working as part of the WorldPop Project and Flowminder Foundation used the anonymised mobile phone records of 19 million users in Portugal and France, for several months in 2007 and 2008, to generate maps showing the densities of users in different geographic areas.These maps were found to be as accurate as traditional census-based maps, which the researchers generated from data from the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies of France and the National Institute of Statistics of Portugal.Furthermore, by combining the mobile and census information with data from satellite imagery, the spatial resolution and accuracy of the census-based maps was greatly improved.Dr Tatem said: “Knowing where people are is critical for accurate impact assessments and intervention planning, particularly for issues such as healthcare, food security, climate change, wars and natural disasters.“Mobile phone network subscription rates globally are now at 96% and anonymous call record data can give us information from a wide-range of countries – high, middle and low income alike. In particular, it can give us detailed information from regions where census data is either non-existent, outdated or very unreliable.”But the research does raise privacy concerns. In March,researchers at Stanford Universityproved that merely examining metadata from mobile phones can lead to uncomfortable insights. For instance, one subject “had a long, early morning call with her sister. Two days later, she placed a series of calls to the local Planned Parenthood location. She placed brief additional calls two weeks later, and made a final call a month after.”And in June, researchers warned that a similar dataset, of anonymised taxi journeys,could be easily de-anonymised, risking the privacy of both drivers and passengers. “Anonymising data is really hard,” explained researcher Vijay Pandurangan, who expressed doubts it was possible to ever release a sizeable anonymous dataset without at least the risk of someone reverse-engineering it and uncovering private information.Dr Tatem and colleagues are already extending their mapping work to low income regions and have used mobile phone-based mobility mapping to help combat malaria more effectively in Namibia.They have improved the targeting of malaria interventions by identifying communities most at risk. Most recently they have used mobile data to help inform authorities tracking and preparing for the spread of ebola in West Africa.The paper Dynamic Population Mapping Using Mobile Phone Data is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Twitch, the popular video-streaming site, hasaltered its rules of conductto prohibit users from appearing in a state of undress, requesting that streamers dress “appropriately”.The new Twitch rule opens with the tried-and-tested rule of flattery:Nerds are sexy, and you’re all magnificent, beautiful creatures, but let’s try and keep this about the games, shall we?The statement then goes on to outlaw “sexually suggestive” clothing and “pasties” – thenipple covers, not the cheese and onion variety:Wearing no clothing or sexually suggestive clothing - including lingerie, swimsuits, pasties, and undergarments – will most likely get you suspended, as well as any full nude torsos*, which applies to both male and female broadcasters. You may have a great six-pack, but that’s better sharedon the beach during a 2-on-2 volleyball game blasting “Playing with the Boys.”Perhaps the most refreshing thing about Twitch’s new rule is that both male and female torsos are banned from appearing on webcams, a level playing field which often does not apply IRL.The company then goes on to offer the following handy tips to streamers struggling with not being naked:• If it’s unbearably hot where you are, and you happen to have your shirt off (gents) or a bikini top (ladies), then just crop the webcam to your face.• If your lighting is hot, get fluorescent bulbs to reduce the heat. Xbox One Kinect doesn’t zoom? Move it closer to you, or turn it off.

Google is the latest tech company to enter the health and fitness game with a dedicated Google Fit Android app that tracks steps and plugs into wearables and other fitness apps.Google Fit is afree Android appthat tracks health and fitness data using a smartphone’s built-in sensors, but like competing apps from Samsung and Apple, it can connect to third-party apps, gadgets and services.“You can also connect your favourite fitness devices and apps like Strava, Withings, Runtastic, Runkeeper and Noom Coach to Google Fit and we’ll surface all of the relevant data in one spot, giving you a clear and complete view of your fitness,” said Sabrina Ellis a director of for Google Fit, ina blog post. “No need to check one app to see your weight and another to review a run – with Google Fit, that data will all be surfaced in one, simple place.”Wrist, smartphone, tablet and browserGoogle’s Fit app first appeared in a very basic form built into Google’s Android Wear smartwatches such as the Motorola Moto 360, LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live. It is capable of tracking steps, recording them through the day and giving a basic history of steps through the week, as well as heart rate for those watches equipped with heart rate sensors.Unlike Motorola’s dedicated Moto 360 heart rate sensor app, Google Fit requires the user to manually measure their heart rate, rather than automatically taking it throughout at the day.Google Fit on a smartphone.Photograph: GoogleThe Android app for smartphones, tablets and browsers allows users to review their history, set goals and track steps, heart rate and calories burnt like any number of other fitness tracking apps, including Facebook’s Moves app and Samsung’s S Health app.But Google Fit goes beyond a simple app and like Apple’s Health for its iPhone and iPad, aims to be a central data store for all fitness information pulled from third-party services. Fit will then chart runs, weight, sports, sleep and other fitness data so that it can be viewed in one place, no longer isolated in individual apps.The first batch of apps that connect to Google Fit from Strava, Withings, Runtastic, Runkeeper, Noom Coach and others are expected within weeks.Lucrative health marketGoogle, Apple, Samsung, LG and other big technology companies are all vying for a slice of the health and fitness market. The healthcare industry is a potentially lucrative market to exploit, worth about 10% of the economy of developed nations. In Britain, more than £100bn a year is spent on the NHS, according to the Department of Health.Google Fit was first announced by Google in June at the company’s I/O developer conference, following Apple’s announcement of its Health Kit for its World Wide Developers Conference earlier that month.

A hacker group believed to be sponsored by the Russian government has attacked governments in Georgia, the Caucasus and eastern Europe, as well as Nato and defence contractors across the west of Europe.The so-called APT28 group has been sending targets emails offering information of interest relevant to the recipient, while registering websites that mimic legitimate news and current events sites. Such “phishing” sites can either be used to trick victims into handing over data, such as usernames and passwords, or to thrust malware onto the visitor’s PC, phone or tablet.Though it could find no direct link to the Russian government, US security company FireEyesaidthe intelligence sought by the hackers was consistent with Russian interests.APT28 tried to break into the systems of Georgia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) and Ministry of Defense (MOD), as well as a journalist covering issues in the Caucasus and a Chechen news site.In the attack on the MIA, a malicious Excel file was emailed to employees. When opened, it launched a decoy document containing a list of Georgian driver’s license numbers, while in the background a backdoor was installed on the victim’s PC that would try to connect to the organisation’s email server. This would collect network information and send it back in an attachment from a seemingly legitimate email address.The attempt to compromise Georgia’s MOD also involved attacks on a US defence contractor that was working with the Georgian military to develop training programmes. The journalist was sent an email with a malicious attachment claiming to come from US political magazine Reason.APT28 had previously used an email lure containing information on the Malaysia Airlines flight downed in Ukraine in a “probable attempt” to compromise the Polish government, FireEye said. It had also set up a fake website on the Baltic Host logistical planning exercises, which are hosted by one of the three Baltic States - Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania - and coincided with training programmes carried out by the US Army and Nato forces this year.“Such targets would potentially provide APT28 with sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence concerning regional military capabilities and relationships,” FireEye said in its report. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Vladimir Titov, had previouslydescribedthe training drills as “a demonstration of hostile intention” and that “all necessary political and military measures to ensure our security” would be taken.The hacker group has also created a number of fake domains for UK-based defence events, including the Farnborough Airshow and the Counter Terror Expo, probably as part of a campaign to gather intelligence on attendees.Alongside the list of targets, other data has indicated the Russian government’s involvement, FireEye said, including the long-term development of its hacker tools - the Sourface downloader, which installs the Eviltoss backdoor on target machines.“APT28 is most likely supported by a group of developers creating tools intended for long-term use and versatility, who make an effort to obfuscate their activity. This suggests that APT28 receives direct ongoing financial and other resources from a well-established organisation, most likely a nation-state government,” the report read.“APT28’s malware settings suggest that the developers have done the majority of their work in a Russian language build environment during Russian business hours, which suggests that the Russian government is APT28’s sponsor.”Russia has been suspected of attacks on Ukraine too, including attempts to gain access to politicians’ mobile phone communications, though FireEye did not find APT28 active in the country. Putin’s administration had previously been linked withcyber attacks on Georgia during the nations’ conflict in 2008.The Russian Embassy in London had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.Nikolay Shelekov, senior specialist for threat prevention in the investigation department of Russian firm Group-IB, told the Guardian the report offered no concrete evidence of Russian government involvement.“Unfortunately, with this information all we can say is that developers may be located in Russia, that’s all.”However, Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab said it had been tracking the same group, which it calls Sofacy. It was involved in investigations into a Sofacy attack in eastern Europe and has also gathered evidence showing the involvement of Russian-speaking hackers.“The Sofacy group is using multiple malware families, including some that are not mentioned in the FireEye paper,” Aleks Gostev, chief security expert in the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab, told the Guardian.“They have been very active lately and have registered many domains in order to launch phishing attacks.”Gostev said his team has also seen suggestions of a link between Sofacy and a group called Miniduke, which has been attempting to infiltrate a range of European targets and Nato.
Google’s latest doodle celebrates the birthday of Niki de Saint Phalle, the artist and sculptor who rose to prominence in the 1960s by developing a trademark style of “shooting” paintings in which colour was shot on to canvasses.Born in 1930 in the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine in the western suburbs of Paris, her parents took her to her mother’s home city of New York in 1937, where she later worked as a fashion model, for Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and Elle among others.She eloped in 1949 with Harry Matthews, a music student, and two years later moved with him to Paris, where she started to develop an interest in painting.A relative late starter in that role, she had her first solo exhibition of paintings in Switzerland in 1956 but she turned out to be a prolific producer of work which led some to categorise her as a pop artist.She divorced Matthews in 1960 and met Swiss artist Jean Tinguely, whose taste for auto-exploding sculptures and general incendiarism in art was close to her own.It was a marriage of collaboration at work that lasted for both of them until his death in 1991. The best known of their many joint projects is the fountain in honour of Igor Stravinsky outside the Pompidou Centre in Paris.Saint Phalle later diversified into creating a perfume and a perfume bottle (an example of which has been acquired by the Victoria and Albert museum in London), working on behalf of sufferers from Aids, and making films. Her death in San Diego in 2002 at the age of 71 was announced by the German city of Hanover, which had commissioned some of her best-known pieces of sculpture.
Suicide prevention charity Samaritans is mining Twitter for signs of people “struggling to cope”, with the aim of alerting their friends and advising them on how to provide support.Samaritans Radarlaunched today as a website that will “flag potentially worrying tweets that you may have missed” once Twitter users register their details.Developed by digital agency Jam, the service will analyse tweets for phrases and keywords that may indicate someone is at risk for suicide, then email friends registered with Samaritans Radar with advice on how to help.The phrases include “tired of being alone”, “hate myself”, “depressed”, “help me” and “need someone to talk to”, although Samaritans admits that the algorithm is likely to evolve over the coming months, to avoid false positives.“Samaritans Radar is in its infancy and won’t get it right every time - it’s not good at sarcasm or jokes yet,” explains the website. “But there’s a way for you to give feedback on whether a Samaritans Radar alert was correct, so the service improves for everyone as it learns more.”The charity has also built a “whitelist” of Twitter accounts belonging to organisations who regularly tweet using the keywords that it’s monitoring, to ensure they are ignored by its alerts system.Samaritans is also stressing Radar’s privacy aspects, sending alerts to users as emails rather than tweets, and never posting to Twitter on a registered user’s behalf.“We know that people struggling to cope often go online looking for support, however, there is still so much we need to learn about why this happens and how we can make the online environment safer for vulnerable people,” said Joe Ferns, executive director of policy, research and development for Samaritans.“By not addressing this issue we run the risk of shutting these discussions down and driving them underground. Instead we need to use tools such as Samaritans Radar to encourage people to look out for one another online, helping them to reach out and offer support.”Samaritans Radar is aimed at the 15m Twitter users in the UK, and particularly at 18-35 year-old “millennials” who are the most active group on the social network.“Twitter actively forges partnerships with organisations in the field of online safety and digital citizenship, and Samaritans has a longstanding reputation for supporting people in times of need,” said Twitter’s global head of trust and safety outreach Patricia Cartes.•Social networks to face government grilling over suicide content
There are a number of social apps promising anonymity or ephemerality – the latter meaning self-destructing content, from messages to photos – yet also offering their services for free.When the time comes to make money from advertising, that presents a problem. Today’s long read comes from Brett Goldstein on Medium, with hisSnapchat Night Vision: Ephemeral Does Not Mean Anonymousarticle.With Snapchat kicking off its advertising program recently, Goldstein poses the question of how it could make more money by targeting ads to specific groups of users “if the content necessary to segment users in the first place is deleted”. His conclusion: it’s easier than you might think.The most valuable information is actually the content you generate, not a stream of longitude and latitude measures. To capture the information stored in your snaps, Snapchat could run each snap you send through a gauntlet of metadata extractors in the minutes and hours before it is deleted.Yes. You read that correctly: Snapchat can analyze the crap out of your pictures before they delete them. In fact, Snapchat might already be doing this.Obligatory caveat: it might not. But the potential for analysing text and speech, background sound, faces and other image elements is clear. Is this something we should be thinking harder about for a whole range of apps, not just Snapchat?The comments section is open for your views on this story, as well as on some of today’s other tech talking points:Adobe isregretting wading into the #GamerGate controversy. “We are not and have never been aligned with Gamergate.

Facebook’s surprised then disappointed investors on Tuesday, sending its shares on a seesaw ride in after-hours trading.The social media firm announced its revenues had topped $3.2bn (£2bn) in the past three months as it increased its share of the mobile advertising market. The figure was a 59% increase on the same period last year and came as the percentage of advertising it takes from mobile grew to 66% from 49% a year earlier.Then came the bad news. In a conference call with analysts, Facebook warned its costs would rise dramatically in 2014 and revenue would slow in the last quarter of the year.The companies shares, which had hit a high of $81.16 on Tuesday, fell by almost 10% before recovering slightly to hover around $73.The trouble started when chief financial officer David Wehner warned there would be a significant hike in expenses in future quarters as Facebook makes major investments to grow its business.Costs rose 41% during the quarter as Facebook added 1,200 new employees, some from its $19bn acquisition of the WhatsApp messaging service and its $2bn purchase of Oculus Rift, maker of a virtual reality headset. Wehner warned costs could rise as much as 75% for the year.The falling share price follows a similar drop on Monday fromTwitter, which lost 10%of its value after reporting slowing growth but rapidly rising revenues.Facebook’s share price drop dented what was otherwise another impressive set of results.It now has 1.35 billion people logging on each month, up 14% from last year, and 864 million logging on daily, also an increase of 14%. The pace of growth has, however, slowed and was up from 1.32 billion in the previous quarter.Mobile again proved to be Facebook’s fastest growing area. The number of monthly active users (MAUs) logging into their accounts via mobile devices was 1.12 billion as of 30 September, a 29% rise year-on-year.“This has been a good quarter with strong results,” said Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook co-founder and CEO. “We continue to focus on serving our community well and continue to invest in connecting the world over the next decade.”Overall, the company reported a profit of $806m, up from $425m a year earlier, in line with analysts’ expectations and despite a warning from the company during its last earnings call that investors should not expect the same kind of growth in the second half of the year.In July, the company announced a 61% increase in revenue during the second quarter as Facebook attracted news users and advertisers spent more money. In the second quarter, Facebook reported more than $2.6bn in ad sales, which was a 67% increase year-over-year. Mobile advertising, an area where Facebook initially struggled, accounted for about 62% of all ad revenue.Facebook is expected to take an 8% share of the $140.7bn global ad market in 2014, according to eMarketer, up from 5.8% in 2013.Brian Wieser, senior research analyst at Pivotal Research in New York said the results were better than expected. “The challenge is how they keep on growing. Managing a company of this scale is a challenge, few companies have had to do it,” he said.James Gellert, chief executive of Rapid Ratings, contrasted the results with those of Twitter, which reported on Monday.Twitter’s share priceslumped close to 10% on Tuesday as investors worried about slowing growth.“It demonstrates the difference between a maturing, solid and evolving business and one that is still struggling to find its way,” he said.
Just as film has the BFI and fine art has the National Gallery, the world of British gaming is to get what will be called the National Videogame Arcade (NVA) with the announcement of a £2.5m centre in Nottingham.The project will be the world’s first cultural centre for gaming, promoting it as an art form every bit as important as film or theatre or dance.Details of the centre were announced at the ninthGameCity festivalbeing held in Nottingham this week.The GameCity director Iain Simons said it was “hugely exciting” and had been coming for some time. “We do tours, we do an archive and we do a festival but what has been lacking is any kind of anchorage to all that … any kind of home for video games.”The NVA will become that home, taking up five floors and 33,000 sq ft of a building that was once an important centre for visual arts as home and gallery space to theMidland Groupof artists.There will be four gallery floors and an education floor and as well as changing exhibitions there will be a permanent display from the 12,000 objects which are held in the National Videogame Archive.Simons said the way games were exhibited and experienced had to be different from watching a film or a gig or going to a gallery.“It throws up some really interesting challenges which we absolutely wouldn’t pretend to have all the answers to. This project is about creating a space in which we can play around … experiment.”Simons said most art forms and genres – music, architecture, visual art, design, narrative – all “come together to form this clumsy, difficult-to-explain thing called video games which might be on your phone or your 60in plasma TV. That makes it difficult to pin down but also makes it really exciting.”Gaming has come a long way since the days when a 1970s teenager might spend hours, days even, knocking a ball back and forward on an Atari games console. It is now an enormous, sophisticated multibillion-pound industry with the UK as a major player.Ian Livingstone, who wrote animportant 2011 report setting out how the UK could become the world’s leading hub for games, said: “For the millions of people who love them, it’s only natural that video games should have their own permanent cultural home.”He said it was a much-needed space along the lines of the National Theatre for performance and the National Gallery for fine art.“Video games have an important role to play in our economy, our education policies and our cultural lives – so while it’s taken a long time to arrive, I can’t wait to visit the first ever National Videogame Arcade.”The new centre is due to open next March and will promote the idea of games being for everybody, no matter how old.One of the most exciting recent developments, Simons said, was that the tools were now available for people to create their own games just as they might sit down and write a poem.The centre will welcome too anyone who raises their eyebrows at games being art. “We’re more interested in moving past that and celebrating whether something is interesting and adds to life.“People who come if they hold that position will be surprised and delighted by the breadth and diversity of what games have become. They are some way removed from what they were if the last time you played was Pac-Man in a pub in 1989.”
Half of all YouTube views are now coming from mobile devices, according to the chief executive, Susan Wojcicki. The company has previously said that“almost 40%” of its watch timecomes from mobile devices.Wojcicki revealed the new statistic during an on-stage interview at the US Code/Mobile conference, where she added that YouTube’s overall watch time is still growing at a 50% rate annually.She also said that YouTube is also considering new ways to charge those viewers for watching, as an alternative to seeing the advertising that has been YouTube’s main business model until now.“YouTube right now is ad-supported, which is great because it has enabled us to scale to a billion users; but there’s going to be a point where people don’t want to see the ads,” said Wojcicki, according toRecode.She described subscriptions as “an interesting model” while adding that “There are going to be cases where people are going to say, ‘I don’t want to see the ads’,” according to theWall Street Journal.Subscriptions aren’t a new idea for YouTube. In May 2013it introduced subscriptions as an optionfor some of its channel owners, enabling them to charge people to watch some videos, and keep 55% of the proceeds.Sesame Street, National Geographic and UFC were part of that initial trial, although by July that yearNational Geographic was admitting publiclythat “We had hoped to set the world on fire. We are not setting the world on fire right now.”“We rolled out the ability for an individual channel to do a subscription,” Wojcicki said this week. “We’ve also been thinking about other ways that it might make sense for us.

3D-printer shipments will grow exponentially until 2018, according to analysts at Gartner.But even with that growth rate, 3D printing is likely to remain a niche pursuit for many years to come, as the firm predicts worldwide shipments of 3D printers to be just 2.3m in 2018.“As radical as the forecast numbers may seem, bear in mind that even the 2.3m shipments that we forecast will be sold in 2018 are a small fraction of the total potential market of consumers, businesses and government organisations worldwide,” said Pete Basiliere, research vice president at Gartner.Estimates as to the total size of the market vary; while Gartner predicts total spending hitting $13.4bn by 2018, rival analysts CCS Insight estimate that the value of that market will reach $4.8bn by 2018.But while consumer 3D printing will grow 10-fold, to sales of 850,000 by 2018, it’s not where the money is. Instead, CCS says that more than three-quarters of the revenue will come from industrial systems, where massive 3D printers are used for prototyping and manufacturing in aerospace, automotive and healthcare sectors.These sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds each, and are better seen as an incremental improvement in the manufacturing process than the categorical shift which many predict will accompany widespread consumer-level 3D printing.“Consumers will only buy 3D printers if they can see a clear use for them,” says Arnaud Gagneux, VP Technology Transformation at CCS. “To drive mass sales, manufacturers need to change the perception that 3D printers are simply a bit of fun and create sustainable demand beyond just an occasional need.”Gagneux has particular criticism for the unfriendly nature of many consumer 3D printers, and says that “current 3D printing technology relies on understanding complex user interfaces, many of which are well beyond casual users.”But Gartner voices a note of hope for consumer printing, predicting that the ability to “plug and print”, letting a user free themselves from the nitty-gritty of setup, will come in 2014. Of course, there’s a trade-off to be made: one way of introducing plug and print capability is to mimic the ink cartridges common amongst 2D printers, which “maximise the likelihood the materials will work well,” Gartner says.“The vast majority of mainstream consumers will demand the simple and consistent operation that ‘plug and print’ can provide them.”There remain potential stumbling blocks. Take-up could be critically hindered if prices stay high, or if intellectual property limits the use of the devices. Early adopters are already seeing some intellectual property conflicts affect what they can and can’t print. In 2013, Square Enix forced one 3D printing site to take down figures based on characters from its game Final Fantasy VII. And way back in 2011, Warhammer creators Games Workshopforced Thingiverseto take down a 3D-printed miniature for wargame Warhammer 40K.
Taylor Swift’s album 1989 has been out for 29 hours now, enough time for it to shoot to the top of the iTunes album chart and for any right-minded person to have played it up to 28 times on loop – unless they’re a Spotify user.The album is, for the time being, only available digitally as a buy-to-own download from select stores (the CD version is more widely sold). While some music sites simply pretend that the album doesn’t exist, Spotify is taking a more direct approach.1989 is listed on the music steaming service, as are the tracks, but without any album art. Instead, there’s a simple message: “The artist or their representatives have decided not to release this album on Spotify. We are working on it and hope they will change their mind soon.”It’s not the first time the Swedish firm has taken that approach. Beyoncé fans were greeted with the same message when her album launched exclusively on iTunes,as wereColdplay and The Black Keys fans.The message isn’t standard practice, either. Albums by other holdouts such as Thom Yorke’s side-project, Atoms for Peace, simply aren’t listed at at all, suggesting that the firm explicitly targets users who are looking for particularly notable absentee albums.But while some holdouts are by bands or artists who are opposed to Spotify on principle, many more are simply a sales tactic, designed to encourage full-price sales of the album to fans before opening it up for streamers down the road. Swift’s last album, Red, is now available on Spotify, despite having launched as an iTunes exclusive.Of course, not every streaming service goes down the road of negotiating with labels and artists. The album is available on Grooveshark, although it is unlikely to have a licensing deal with her label to make it available.The ad-funded site lets subscribers upload music and stream tracks for free, and has long been controversial in the recording industry for this practice. The company relies on the “safe harbour” provisions of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act to keep it safe from the potential claims of infringement, but in late September, the group was found liable for infringement by its own employees,who uploaded almost 6,000 tracks without permission.

Tidal is the latest streaming music service hoping to make waves in the digital music market,launching today in the UK and UShoping to take on Spotify, Deezer, Beats Music and others.Launched by Scandinavian technology company Aspiro, its monthly subscription is twice the price of most of those rivals – $19.99 / £19.99 – with the firm hoping that its promise of “HiFi-quality” music persuades music fans to stump up the extra cost.It will stream tracks at “lossless” quality – FLAC/ALAC 44.1kHz / 16 bit files at 1411 kbps to be specific – with distribution partnerships already signed with a range of hi-fi manufacturers including Sonos, Denon and Harman.Tidal is also betting on more than just audio. It has 25m songs available to stream, but also 75,000 music videos and a team of editors writing features and interviews about established and emerging artists.“The music is just one part of the service. The expert editorial educates, entertains and enriches the music experience while the music videos complement the music perfectly,” said Tidal’s chief executive Andy Chen.“We are sure that Tidal will quickly become the music streaming service of choice for all who appreciate high quality at every level.”Unlike Spotify and Deezer, Tidal will not offer a free version of its service supported by advertising. Aspiro has signed deals with all three major labels, as well as independent labels and collecting societies in the US and UK.Like those rivals, it will be available through computers, iOS and Android apps and connected hi-fis. On the latter front, Tidal says it already has 34 deals with more to come.Tidal’s roots lie in WiMP, the Aspiro-owned service that is a rival to Spotify in Scandinavia, and which has its own double-price WiMP HiFi tier offering lossless-quality streams. At the end of June 2014,WiMP had 580,000 paying users, including 17,000 signed up to its HiFi version.Other services are also exploring higher-quality streaming.Deezer recently launched in the USwith “Deezer Elite” which offers similar 1,411kbps streams for $14.99-a-month, through a distribution partnership with Sonos.Fellow French firm Qobuz has been offering similarly high-quality streams through itsQobuz Hi-Fiservice, while British radio group Absolute Radio has beenexperimenting with streaming its stations at lossless quality.How about Spotify? The company said in September that it has been testing lossless streams, but does not believe the technology is ready to launch yet.“We’re thinking about it all the time, but it’s a trade-off. If we go for lossless, would we be able to deliver the same instant experience that Spotify gives? If we could, we would,” its head of hardware partnershipsPascal de Mul told Gizmodo.“At the moment, we don’t think we can do it. We’re testing it, we’re looking at it, but we don’t want to go back to that pre-Spotify time where you’d double-click on a track and you see a little timer going, and only after five seconds the music starts.”But with more people installing faster broadband connections at home and buying connected hi-fis, Tidal, Deezer and others are betting that the time is right to take the risk of those spinning timers.Lossless streaming is also likely to be pitched to musicians as part of the solution to their complaints about the royalties they receive from streaming music.In February, Aspiro’s Kjartan Slette encouraged an audience of artists at the By:larm conference in Norway to promote WiMP HiFi to their fans over cheaper rivals. “If you can get them into WiMP HiFi, you will get twice the money,” he said, during a session attended by the Guardian.If that argument is reflected in royalty statements from Tidal other lossless services, it may help to win over some artists who’ve been sceptical about streaming.•Five big challenges for Spotify and streaming music•Streaming music: what next for iTunes, YouTube and Spotify?
Kim Kardashian is a self-confessed BlackBerry addict and admitting to having not one but three of the Canadian smartphones stacked up just in case one breaks.Kardashian uses other smartphones, including an iPhone for photos, but her love of the physical keyboard keeps her tied to a BlackBerry – not the new Passport or Q20, but an old BlackBerry Bold.“I love a BlackBerry,” Kardashian admitted to theCode Mobile conference on Monday. “Every time I say that, people are horrified that I have a BlackBerry, and I don’t understand that reaction.”“BlackBerry has my heart and soul, I’ll never get rid of it,” she said. “I do have an iPhone, and I use that for photos, but if you have an email and you need to type fast, you need to have that keyboard.”Kardashian also admitted that despite BlackBerry releasing several new models, including the square Passport, she hadn’t “actually turned it on” and that it was “a little large”. Instead she prefers the compact frame of the Bold so much that she keeps a stock of the old devices ready in case one breaks.“They don’t even have them in stores anymore. I buy them on eBay. It’s a BlackBerry Bold. And I like to have three in my room that I line up in case they break,” she said.A BlackBerry spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian that Kardashian does not have an endorsement deal with the company.Shrinking user base, but still some strongholdsIn its prime, BlackBerry’s 80 million users ranked among the world’s elite, from US president Barack Obama, who refused to give up his BlackBerry when taking office, forcing the NSA to secure one for his personal use, to celebrities, sports stars and business people.Even Google’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, used a BlackBerry instead of the the company’s Android smartphones because he liked the keyboard.After years of decline, BlackBerry users number approximately 46 million, with 36 million business users.But Kardashian isn’t the only celebrity left using a BlackBerry. The actor Bill Murray selected an old BlackBerry as his first smartphone, purely for texting his children, while Lindsay Lohan, Cuba Gooding Jr and Leonardo DiCaprio have all been spotted regularly using BlackBerrys this year.Tim Allen from Home Improvement fame recently showed off his BlackBerry Passport on the Jimmy Kimmel show in the US, while singers Christina Aguilera and Drake both use BlackBerrys.It seems many users cling to the BlackBerry because typing on the keyboard over typing on a touch screen offers a couple of advantages.@SamuelGibbsNo look accurate typing.

When Sean Murray was very small, his parents picked up their five young children and moved from Ireland to a million-acre ranch in the Australian outback. It was so vast and isolated, the only viable form of travel was light aircraft (the ranch had seven landing strips); Sean and his brother and sisters had to be taught what to do if they were out in the bush with an adult who collapsed or died. “You stay with the body,” Sean explains, brightly. “You light a fire in the morning and at night, and you just stay.”He pauses for a second. “It was an odd childhood.”Thirty years later, Murray is working on the game he says he has always wanted to make; a game that has received reams of ecstatic press coverage since its surprise announcement at last year’s Spike TV Video Game Awards.The classic space sim Elite was a key source of inspiration for the landscapes and creatures in No Man’s Sky.Photograph: Hello Games PRNo Man’s Sky is a gigantic space exploration adventure, set in a persistent online universe populated simultaneously by every participating player. Whenever a new planet is discovered, a complex algorithm automatically generates its landscape, flora and fauna. You may land on a barren wasteland with a lethally toxic atmosphere, or an Eden swarming with exotic wildlife – and once the planet is discovered and generated, it is available for all other players to explore. The universe builds around its inhabitants.The stars, my destinationThe concept of No Man’s Sky was born in Murray’s childhood, out on that endless, sun-baked ranch. “I was trying to live and survive in a world that was as close to alien as you can get on Earth,” he says. “At the same time, I had my first Amstrad computer, and I was playing Elite – I could go outside and see these amazing night skies, then I would play this game and see thousands of stars that I could actually visit – and I wanted to visit every one of them.”Five years ago, Murray left Criterion, where he had been working on the blockbusting Burnout series of knockabout racers. Taking three colleagues with him, he set up Hello Games in a single-room office in Guildford and began work on a comparatively modest debut; the motorbike stunt sim Joe Danger. Released on PlayStation 3 in 2010 it was a success, eventually making its way to Xbox 360, iOS and the Vita.“I’m incredibly proud of it,” says Murray. “We poured a lot into Joe Danger … but it’s not what we started Hello Games for. We started it for No Mans Sky - this game is everything to us.” So with a manageable debut out of the way, and some stability behind them, the team moved on to its grand design.Every player enters No Man’s Sky in the same way – at the circumference of the galaxy with a crappy spaceship and hardly any money. How they cope is up to them; they can become traders, touching down on planets and gathering resources to sell; they can be pirates, blasting space freighters to pieces to steal their stock. With more money, pilots can visit space stations (there’s one in every solar system) to purchase upgrades like the hyperdrive, which allows interstellar exploration; or they can buy better weapons and more durable spacesuits. There are no missions, there is no structure. There is just space.The space stations in No Man’s Sky are the key trading hubs. The systems aren’t finalised yet, but it seems players will be able to bring in resources taken from planet surfaces and exchange them for new weapons and equipmentPhotograph: Hello Games PRIn many ways, No Man’s Sky owes much more to the science fiction of the 60s and early 70s – when the space race engendered a sense of fascination with the possibilities of galactic exploration. Its planets, with their vibrant colours and hallucinogenic skylines, reflect the aesthetic sensibilities of Star Trek, Barbarella and 2001.The player’s spacecraft lands on a lush alien world, a distant moon looming in the backgroundPhotograph: Hello Games PRThere are, of course, other massively ambitious multiplayer space games in development – Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen being the key contenders. But these seem to be much more conventional in their emphasis on power, status and combat. You buy better ships so you can blast other players out of the sky; you rank up; you shoot more stuff. No Man’s Sky certainly has AI-controlled spacecraft to fight, and no doubt there will be player-on-player skirmishes, but that’s not what it’s about. It’s about discovery. Although Murray doesn’t want to give the wrong impression about that.“There’s a tendency, when you hear the word exploration in games, to think that it will be entirely ambient – that you’ll just walk around looking at flowers. That’s not what No Man’s Sky is,” he says. “Space is full of life and danger and you are an alien in that scenario – not everyone wants to be friendly. That’s how the universe is.“It’s also dangerous on planets. Each one has an ecology, and you’re not always at the top of the food chain; we’ve shown large creatures that attack you. There’s also something else we haven’t shown. There is a malevolent force in the universe that does provide a lot of combat and more core gameplay at times. We wanted that; we wanted players to wander around exploring planets but never to feel entirely safe.”Lonely planetsThe big question right now, is about how social the game will be. Players exist together in a shared universe, but as Douglas Adams once wrote, space is big. Really big. Murray told reportersat Gamescom in August, that the program behind No Man’s Sky is capable of generating “billions of planets”.How often will we meet other players? Apparently, it will be possible for participants to leave their mark on the planets they visit – is this how communication will work?“We don’t know,” says Murray. “We don’t know if people will spread evenly out across the universe, or whether they’re going to corral into areas that have already been explored, whether they will form little trade routes, little strips of familiar worlds, going from the outside edge like the spokes of a wheel toward the centre of the galaxy … or whether it will be totally random.”Each world in No Man’s Sky is “seeded” – or procedurally generated – by a 32bit number. The system can build millions of planets, each using the same algorithm to generate its features, but it’s unlikely you’ll ever find two that look the same. “If you were to visit a planet every second you would see repetition after 4000 years,” says Murray.Photograph: Hello Games PRHe does know however, that players will be encouraged to venture deeper into uncharted space. The best ships and weapons are only available as you head in toward the heart of the galaxy. However, the further you go, the more dangerous the worlds, and the more aggressive the computer-controlled space ships. No Man’s Sky may be unconventional in its emphasis on exploration and experience, but it still has the structure and mechanisms of a game; there is intelligent design rather chaos.Hello Games has a larger office now, a converted workshop with rough wooden floors and its own meeting room. Last year, the building was flooded, destroying much of the company’s equipment – the team simply moved upstairs and redecorated. This is the game they formed the company to make – nothing is getting in the way of that.“When we’ve come to events like Gamescom before, we’ve had to drive our own van, and bring our own sofas - it’s things like that that push you,” says Murray.“You think, ‘one day it’ll be different. One day we will make something huge.’”Once upon a time, a little boy looked out over a vast nothingness to the teeming stars above. Now he and his friends have made a universe, and we will all be able to visit.No Man’s Sky will be released on PC and PlayStation 4 in 2015.The five most disruptive ideas in video game design
Microsoft; Xbox One; £45; Pegi rating: 16+Sunset Overdrive, for all its nerdy meme in-jokes, Heath Robinson-esque weaponry and explosive bluster, is a game about class. More precisely, it’s about the blue-collar fantasy of rising up and stamping on the corporate foot under which you were once downtrodden. It’s just that this particular corporate foot commands an army of mutants killers.In Sunset Overdrive, you play as a rubbish collector for an international drinks corporation, FizzCo, serving the city’s unthankful citizens as they guzzle down the company’s newest product, an irradiated energy slop called OverCharge Delirium. Unfortunately, a slight oversight with some of the ingredients means that anyone who drinks the stuff transforms into a wart-ravaged monster. Sunset City is immediately quarantined – not by the police, but by FizzCo itself, which hopes to contain the PR disaster – and your aim (as a non-drinker) is to escape by any means possible.The anti-corporate theme is emphasised by a punk rock soundtrack (there are none of Grand Theft Auto’s radio stations to offer a variety of soundtracks – it’s all punk, all the time) and there are rewards for smashing CCTV cameras, vandalising billboards, hacking into smartphones and other shorthand acts for rage against the contemporary machine.Your character moves like a working-class superhero, able to grind elegantly, skater-like along the overhead cables and rails that bisect the city (with a phallic, barking shotgun in hand). He can sprint indefinitely along walls, bounce from the bonnets of cars high into the air and even rip frothily along the surface of water, as if being tugged along by an invisible speedboat.And it doesn’t have to be ahe. Although the game is advertised with a male protagonist, players can opt for a woman instead, and all the collectible clothing in the game is gender-neutral.Shooting through the cityTraversing the city is a thorough delight (and the game’s strongest asset), allowing a skilled player to enter a state of immediate flow, moving over and across buildings, rivers and bridges in an uninterrupted string of movement. This is just as well: aside from a couple of missions during which you fly a glider, or ride a runaway train, you’re on foot. In this regard, the game improves with time: you steadily unlock new abilities to aid traversals and your journeying becomes ever quicker and less troubled by the laws of physics.The anti-establishment sentiment does not extend to the game’s systems themselves, however, which are melange of ideas (some interesting, others regretfully cliched) pulled from other games that fit into the so-called “open world” genre. There’s the endless collect ‘em up busywork borrowed from the Assassin’s Creed series (these items, which include toilet rolls and balloon mascots are used to power-up your armoury). There are Dead Rising’s comic costumes and madcap weapons, built from seemingly incompatible objects (a grenade launcher that fires explosive teddy bears, a handgun that spits 12” vinyl records). There are Crackdown’s athletic side-missions in which you race through parts of the city against the clock (and against other players’ high scores). It’s a patchwork of well-worn concepts.Everything you own can be improved through use: weapons level up, and both your character and the guns they wield can be equipped with modifying “amps”, which are activated when you perform the requisite number of stylish tricks while moving about. The cat’s cradle of interlocking systems is robust, but familiar. Where Sunset Overdrive’s narrative and bright, explosive visual style work so hard to create a sense of irreverence and anarchy (the orange mutant blood spells out “blam” and “pop” when their bodies explode under fire), the underlying game is more conservative.The story and dialogue try awfully hard to achieve a tone of bold irreverence – both lack the assured punch of open world rival Borderlands. The attempts to satirise video game tropes are weak and, again, better delivered in games such as Far Cry: Blood Dragon. Other survivors of the sugary drink apocalypse dole out missions but these characters are built on tired, unmemorable cliches (there are the idiotic rich American private-school kids, the live-action role-playing nerds and so on). The missions themselves are more creative, at their best when they ask you to climb a skyscraper, or ride on the back of a giant Chinese dragon and at their worst when you have to (repeatedly) defend a base from waves of attackers.Fighting the systemThe combat is chunky, and the weapons change its feel in meaningful ways (each one works with differing efficiency on each of the four main types of enemy). The appeal of grinding along a train track rail while blasting passing mutants endures and there’s a host of forthcoming extras to maintain interest, including Sunset TV, a weekly video viewed in-game used to broadcast news and issue new challenges and goals. There’s also an eight-player co-op mode seamlessly accessible from phone booths around the map, that allows groups to indulge in a variety of siege-like face-offs with hordes of enemies.Despite these creative flourishes, Sunset Overdrive never quite surpasses the chaotic physics of Just Cause, the coherent style of Blood Dragon or the assured sense of place of GTAV – nor does it manage to draw its story and systems toward a coherent, impactful point. In the end its hero escapes the purgatory of a boring job and successfully wreaks revenge on the judgmental consumers he once served. But the game itself does little to undermine the increasingly over-familiar, open-world establishment, instead quietly celebrating the status quo.

Users of internet anonymiser Tor are being advised to secure their connections and check their computers for malware, after a security researcher discovered that the service was being used to inject potentially malicious code into downloads over the service.Tor allows users to surf the web anonymously by bouncing their connection between “relay” nodes before it exits back on to the open internet through an “exit” node, of which slightly more than 1,000 exist dotted around the world.But for an unknown length of time, at least one exit node, based in Russia, has been silently altering programs downloaded through Tor,according to Josh Pitts, a security researcher for Leviathan Security.Programs for Windows, when downloaded through the malicious node, were silently wrapped in malware, malicious code, rendering them dangerous to any computer running them. Concerningly, even files downloaded through Windows update were affected.While Microsoft’s own tools are capable of spotting a tampered download, Pitts says the unspecific error code can actually lead a user back into danger. “If you Google the error code, the official Microsoft response is troublesome,” he says. “The first link will bring you to the official Microsoft Answers website … If you follow the three steps from the official MS answer, two of those steps result in downloading and executing a MS ‘Fixit’ solution executable.“If an adversary is currently patching binaries as you download them, these ‘Fixit’ executables will also be patched. Since the user, not the automatic update process, is initiating these downloads, these files are not automatically verified before execution as with Windows Update. In addition, these files need administrative privileges to execute, and they will execute the payload that was patched into the binary during download with those elevated privileges.”The attack is a particular type of “man in the middle” attack, in which the connection is passed through a malicious third party which attempts to capture or alter information. For a typical user, such attacks are difficult to pull off, requiring the attacker to breach the users connection. But if a connection regularly goes through an untrusted third party – as withChinese users, who have to contend with their country’s “great firewall”, or with Tor users – such an attack becomes much easier.The Tor Project has flagged the malware-spamming Russian node as malicious, ensuring that properly updated users won’t encounter it again. But, says the project lead, Roger Dingledine, “it seems like a tough arms race to play … the better approach is to have applications not blindly trust unauthenticated bits they get from the internet.”Tor users can limit their exposure to such attacks by ensuring they use encrypted connections before downloading programs over the network. Pitts adds that “All users should have a way of checking hashes and signatures out of band prior to executing the binary”, to ensure that the file they downloaded is the same as the one they requested.
After recent criticism of Twitter’s plans to start showing tweets in people’s timelines from accounts that they don’t follow, the social network has stressed that it will “always be a real-time network”.Twitter told users in Octoberthat it was testing ways to show “tweets we think you’d enjoy” in their timelines, but its chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, has now tried to reassure users that the company’s priorities aren’t skewed.“Twitter will always be a real-time network. That is our number one priority when we think about the user experience,” said Noto duringTwitter’s earnings callafter the companyreported its financial results for the third quarter of 2014.But Noto added that Twitter is continuing to experiment, including re-showing tweets that people might have missed first time round, even if they follow the accounts that posted them.“There are time periods when something incredibly relevant to you as a user could have occurred hours ago before you open up the Twitter app,” said Noto. “We will see unique opportunities like that to give you content that’s incredibly relevant even if it’s not based on what happened most recently.”Twitter has already been changing its signup process for new users, simplifying it “from 12 steps to approximately six or seven”, while building an initial timeline for them rather than expecting them to know exactly who to follow.Chief executive Dick Costolo said the new system “automatically creates a timeline based on what topics users choose as well as our browsing history”, with the aim of reducing the number of people who register for Twitter, then drop out quickly.“We get them into a fully populated timeline that does not require them to immediately know the language of Twitter or who is on Twitter,” Costolo told analysts. “Expect to see this on mobile in short order.”Twitter is also working on making its service more useful even for people who aren’t logged in when visiting its site. Costolo said that there are “hundreds of millions” of people who visit Twitter without logging in – “another one to two times the size of the core” users for the social network.“We’re scratching the surface on giving these individuals unique content that meets their specific need on that specific use case for which they come,” added Noto.During the earnings call, Costolo said he’s keeping an open mind about extending Twitter’s advertising units to external apps, like the company’s own TweetDeck or third-party apps like Flipboard.However, he said advertising isn’t heading to Twitter’s video-sharing service Vine in the near future. “Our near term and immediate term focus in Vine are continuing to build beautiful content creation tools for all of the users of that service,” said Costolo.Earlier, Twitter had reported that its revenues had grown 114% year-on-year to $361m in the third quarter of 2014, when it averaged 284m monthly active users (MAUs).However, the company’s share price fell 10% in the hours after the financials announcement, with investors concerned about the fact that while MAUs were up 23% year-on-year, they rose less than 5% quarter-on-quarter.•Twitter changes: 20 hits and misses from its history
Have you heard the latest Led Zeppelin interviews? They’ve not been recorded and aired by a broadcaster or a music magazine.Instead, they’re available through streaming music service Spotify: the third instalment inits series of “Landmark” documentariesabout classic albums following past looks at Nirvana’s Nevermind and Nas’ Illmatic.This time round, it’s Led Zeppelin IV getting the treatment, with new audio interviews with surviving band members Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, presented as a Spotify playlist that mixes the chat with the remastered tracks.Spotify isn’t the only digital music service getting into editorial: Google’s music teammade a YouTube “mini-doc” about The Clashlast year, while Scandinavian streaming service WiMP’s homepage mixes interviews and editorial with streams and videos.All of these services have editorial teams compiling playlists too, providing the curation that I grew up getting from weekly music magazines like NME and Melody Maker.Meanwhile, music site Bandcamp is building a catalogue of reviews from fellow fans about the albums they’ve bought, while crowdfunding service PledgeMusic is providing the kind of behind-the-scenes stuff while albums are being made that I used to get from those magazines too.It’s making me wonder: are digital music services increasingly the place where we’ll be finding what we traditionally think of as “music journalism”, from longform interviews to recommendations for new tracks?Not necessarily as a replacement for traditional writing – there are more outlets than ever online, even if the economics of it are challenging – but as an additional channel where the music itself is woven into the journalism?

Apple’s upcoming smartwatch will require a daily battery charge, according to the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook.The companyunveiled Apple Watch in Septemberas its first wearable product, but was careful not to announce any figures for its battery life. Speaking at the WSJD Live conference yesterday, Cook confirmed speculation that the device will need to be plugged in every day.“We think you’re going to end up charging it daily. Overnight, that’s what we think,” said Cook,according to The Verge. “I think given my own experience, and others around it, that you’re going to wind up charging it every day. Because you’re going to use it so much.”Battery life has been a talking point for the current generation of smartwatches. Whenthe Guardian reviewed Motorola’s Moto 360 device, for example, getting its battery to last from 7.30am to 11pm required turning its step-counting feature off.Other smartwatches have fared better on the battery life issue. The Pebble Steel, for example,lasts for more than five days on a single charge.During his on-stage interview at WSJD Live, Cook also talked about Apple Pay, the company’s new mobile payment technology, claiming that in the first 72 hours after its launch in the US earlier this month, Apple activated more than 1m cards.Cook said that this gives Apple “more than the total of all the other guys” in the US contactless payments market. “We’ve only been at it a week. I feel fantastic... We’re just getting started, but the early ramp looks fantastic.”Some US stores aren’t convinced yet, with companies including Walmart and Target refusing to accept Apple Pay at their stores, amid rumours that retailers arethrowing their weight behind a rival system called Current C. Cook described the situation as “a skirmish” during his interview.He also suggested that Apple may consider a partnership with Chinese firm Alibaba, which has its own Alipay payments technology. “We love to partner with people who are wicked smart, with flexible teams, who are product-based, who push us, and we push them,” he said.During the event, Cook was also asked why Apple recently stopped selling its iPod Classic device, which although overtaken by newer products like the iPod touch and iPhone, remained a symbol of Apple’s comeback as a consumer electronics company.“We couldn’t get the parts any more. They don’t make them any more,” said Cook,according to Engadget. “We would have to make a whole new product... the engineering work to do that would be massive... The number of people who wanted it is very small.”•Two months with Android Wear: the best smartwatches yet
Travellers know that when it comes to making journeys more bearable, good noise-cancelling headphones can make the difference.Active noise cancelling(ANC) headphones use microphones located on the ear cups to detect incoming unwanted sound and blast the inverse of that sound out of the earphones. The sound waves overlap, cancelling each other out and silencing outside noise.Most noise-cancelling technology is designed to block out the drone of aircraft, road noise or hum of computers, placing a veil of silence over the ears allowing listeners to clearly hear the music without the volume needing to be turned up to 11. But hundreds of ANC headphones are available, making choosing the right pair hard.Here’s a quick guide to six of the best to suit almost any budget.Digital Silence DS-321DDigital Silence 321Photograph: Digital SilencePrice: £42Both the smallest and cheapest in this selection, these are surprisingly effective at blocking background noise, and put some higher priced rivals to shame. They fit snugly in the ear and block out background noise with rubber earbuds in addition to the ANC. They also sound reasonably good for in-ear headphones, with crisp reproduction of music and voices but lacking real deep bass.A battery pack on the cable just before the headphone jack powers the electronics and is about the size of a thumb with a sturdy clip on the back.Monitor mode, allowing wearers to hear announcements, is activated at a touch of a button on the battery pack, while an in-line remote on the cable has a pause/play button and a microphone for using it as a headset with a smartphone.They give approximately 14 hours of use, but will continue to play music when the battery runs flat, albeit without noise cancelling. A full charge via microUSB takes two hours.Verdict:small, cheap and surprisingly good ANC on a budget.Others to consider:Audio-Technica ANC33IS,Digital Silence DS-421DSennheiser PXC 250-IIThe headphones collapse into a tight package.Photograph: SennheiserPrice £105Light, compact, on-ear headphones that are comfortable to wear and collapse like a pair of reading glasses for travel. The small ear cups do little to passively block out noise, but the noise cancelling is effective at silencing background drone.They have a well-rounded sound, characteristic of Sennheiser headphones, with accurate highs and crisp treble. Bass is not overly powerful as you might expect from the small speakers.The main detractor is the bulky battery pack, which takes a single AAA battery lasting approximately 50 hours. It has a clip on the back and an analogue volume control wheel.Verdict:small, compact headphones but bulky battery pack is annoying.Audio-Technica ANC70Audio-Technica ANC70Photograph: Audio-TechnicaPrice: £140A mid-range set with full-size over-ear cups. Unlike smaller headphones, the ear cups hold all the electronics and an AAA battery to power the electronics for up to 40 hours, removing the need for a separate box connected to the cable.The headphones are light and have soft foam ear pads – comfortable to wear for extended periods like a seven-hour plane journey.The left-hand cup has an on-off switch, a volume slider and a pause-play button, along with a glowing blue light when the ANC is active. The headphones work without power and the cable is removable.The noise cancelling is decent at blocking drone, but fails to block chatter or other non-background noise and the headphones are not great at blocking noise passively.Audio quality is average, with clear and accurate mid-range, but harsh highs and a lack of real bass despite the size of the headphones.Verdict:light and comfortable, but noise cancelling and sound quality could be better.Others to consider: Ultimate Ears 9000Plantronics Backbeat ProPlantronics BackBeat ProPhotograph: PlantronicsPrice: £190The Plantronics Backbeat Pro are Bluetooth noise-cancelling headphones, connecting wirelessly to two smartphones, tablets or computers simultaneously. They will also work with a removable cable, and continue to play music when the battery is flat.The large, soft, over-ear cups and foam-padded headband are comfortable. The left-hand cup has a pause-play button and a track-skip jog dial. The right cup has a large volume dial, an audio monitor button and a call handling button. The volume dial is particularly intuitive and satisfying to use.Noise cancelling is effective at blocking out more ambient noise than the Audio-Technica ANC70s, while the thick ear cups passively mute talking and other noises.Solid, deep bass, accurate mids and highs produce a warm, rounded sound. The battery lasts for 24 hours with noise cancelling over Bluetooth and up to 60 without ANC active. Sensors in the headphones also pause the music and turn off noise cancelling when taking them off to save battery.Verdict:comfortable, good noise blocking and wireless with punchy sound.Others to consider:Beats Studio Wireless, Parrot ZikBose QuietComfort 20Bose Quiet Comfort 20iPhotograph: BosePrice: £260The Bose QuietComfort 20 earphones are the best in-ear noise-cancelling headphones money can buy.They have a thin but long and wide 16-hour battery pack, which can be awkward in a pocket, and an in-line music remote with monitor button and a microphone for taking calls.The soft silicone ear buds have hooks for securing them in the ear and are comfortable for long wearing periods. They have solid bass, accurate highs and punchy treble, sounding a cut above the Digital Silence DS-321D, but do not sound quite as good as earphones without noise cancelling costing £260.The QC20s have impressive noise cancelling, and are very good at blocking both background drone and foreground noises like people talking – significantly more than most full-size noise cancelling headphones.Verdict:the best noise-cancelling earphones, but very expensive.Others to consider:Sony XBA-NC85DBose QuietComfort 25Bose Quiet Comfort 25Photograph: BosePrice: £270The just released QC25s are Bose’s new flagship noise-cancelling headphones. The large cup earphones and padded band across the head are comfortable, while they are light for extended wear. They have quite a firm grip on the head that some might find uncomfortable.The QC25s have good passive sound blocking, while their noise cancelling is unparalleled, silencing more ambient background noise than any other headphone tested.A single AAA battery lasts 35 hours. Once it runs out the headphones still play music, but sound muted. The headphone cable is removable and has an in-line remote.The soundscape of the headphones is open and less direct into your ears than many headphones, which should make listening to them for long periods easier. Treble, highs and bass are accurate, but lack energy with a more neutral balance – people looking for deep, rumbling bass will have to look elsewhere. Better-sounding headphones are available without noise cancelling at £270.Verdict:the best noise cancelling with decent sound but at a high price.Others to consider:Sony MDR-1RNC,Audio-Technica ANC9Other reviews:•Five best laptops to suit any budget•Which is the best smartphone for less than £150?
Twitter’s share price dropped 10% in after-hours trading on Monday amid continuing signs of slowing growth at the social media company.Results released on Monday for the third quarter of the year show Twitter’s revenues soared to $361m, up 114% from the same period last year, beating expectations. But the number of monthly active users of the service grew just 13 million to 284 million from the previous quarter. Analysts had predicted growth would between 14 million and 17 million.The number of monthly active users represents a 23% increase year on year but was up just 4.8% from the last set of results and below the 6.3% quarter-on-quarter growth it reported in the second quarter.The company hasshaken up managementand begun changing its platform in order to make it more accessible to new users. During the quarter it updated its service on Apple’s iPhone, introduced a new options for its Vine video service and launched a new service tailored to NFL fans. Last week it held its firstdevelopers conferencein four years, a move to embed its real-time technology in a new generation of apps and services.While revenues are growing strongly, Twitter remains unprofitable. It reported a net loss of $175m for the quarter, up from $64.6m last year. And the slowing growth rate has worried investors.Twitter’s share price was $48.56 when stock markets closed on Monday, down 24% this year. The company also disappointed investors with its prediction for revenues for the current quarter. Twitter is projecting revenues between $440m and $450m, the midpoint of which is below the average analyst estimate on Thomson Reuters of $448m.“We had another very strong financial quarter,” said Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter. “I’m confident in our ability to build the largest daily audience in the world, over time, by strengthening the core, reducing barriers to consumption and building new apps and services.”Twitter’s stated aim is to eventually reach every person on the planet. In a conference call with analysts Costolo said he was happy with the “strategy and the quality” of what the company was doing but that given the scale of the company’s ambitions it was “more critical than ever” for Twitter to pick up the pace.The company remains strong in mobile – the fastest growth area for advertisers. Mobile advertising revenue accounted for 85% of total advertising revenue in the quarter.Twitter accounted for 0.5% of global digital ad revenues in 2013, according to eMarketer. That figure is expected to increase to 0.8% this year. By comparison, Facebook, which reports its latest quarterly results tomorrow, is expected to increase its share of the worldwide digital ad market from 5.8% in 2013 to 8% this year.
Fresh from launching itsFire TV set-top box, Amazon has unveiled another gadget designed to play music, video and games on TV sets.Fire TV Stickis a $39 device that plugs into a television’s HDMI port, and will compete directly withGoogle’s Chromecastwhen it goes on sale in the US on 19 November.Amazon is already talking up the rivalry, promising on its website that the Fire TV Stick will offer “4x the storage and 2x the memory of Chromecast”, although with millions of the latter sold already, Amazon has some catching up to do.Like Chromecast and the similar Roku Streaming Stick, Amazon’s new device is focused on streaming entertainment. Once plugged in to a TV, it will be able to access Amazon’s own video-on-demand and music services, as well as Netflix, Hulu Plus and Crackle for video and Spotify and Pandora for music.Games available at launch will include Flappy Birds Family – the follow-up to popular mobile game Flappy Bird – as well as Tetris and games based on Disney films Monsters University and Toy Story.Twitch, the games video-streaming service thatAmazon is buying for almost $1bn, will also be supported by the Fire TV Stick, providing it with another route into the living room.The device will be controlled via a physical remote that ships with it, as well as by companion apps for Android and iOS. Like the Fire TV, it will also support voice search.Fire TV Stick will be sold alongside the $99 Fire TV box, which went on sale in the US in April, then the UK this month.Amazon has not yet announced a UK launch date for the newer device, although based on its strategy with hardware like the Fire TV, Fire Phone and Kindle Fire tablets, the UK is likely to be among the first non-US countries to get the gadget.•Goliath v Goliath: who will win the Google v Amazon war?
The original image-sharing service for Twitter has secured a last-minute deal with the social network, ensuring that all 800m photos on the site will stay online.TwitPic, founded in February 2008 as a site for tweeters to share images before the functionality was built into the service itself, will hand over its domain and entire photo archive to Twitter, ensuring that old links to TwitPic continue to serve photos “for the time being”.But the service itself will still shut down, and existing users will have to make the switch to Twitter’s own image-sharing service, if they haven’t already.Explaining the decision, Twitpic’s founder Noah Everettsaid: “Twitter shares our goal of protecting our users and this data. Also, since Twitpic’s user base consists of Twitter users, it makes sense to keep this data with Twitter.”“This will be my final chapter with Twitpic, and again I want to say thank you for allowing me to be a part of your photo sharing memories for nearly seven years. It has been an honour.”Twitpic’s early success as the de facto image service for Twitter led to it being the host of a number of the social network’s most famous viral images. Perhaps the most important for both sites wasJānis Krūms’ pictureof the crashed US Airways Flight 1549, which made an emergency landing in the Hudson river in 2009 after a bird strike took out both engines.Five years on, many peg the “Miracle on the Hudson” as the moment Twitter proved its worth as a news-gathering service, with pictures like Krūms’ and on-the-ground testimonials spreading the story far and wide long before the traditional media had arrived on the scene.But despite the site’s historical importance, it came a hair’s breadth from destroying the entire archive. In September, Everett announced that Twitpic would have to close down entirely due to a trademark dispute with Twitter.“A few weeks ago Twitter contacted our legal demanding that we abandon our trademark application or risk losing access to their API,”he wrote at the time. “This came as a shock to us as Twitpic has been around since early 2008, and our trademark application has been in the USPTO since 2009.”Some were left wonderingwhy Twitpic didn’t simply change its name in response to Twitter’s demands. That lead to speculation that the squabble over the name was a convenient smokescreen for a company struggling to stay afloat after Twitter destroyed its business model by offering photo-sharing built in to the service.Other sites that offered image-sharing services in the early days of Twitter are still around, but with markedly different business models.Yfrogpivoted to become a full-blown photo sharing network, while Instagram fought Twitter on its own terms, growing to rival Twitter in size – before being bought by Facebook for $1bn in 2012.
Taking place every October in and around the centre of Nottingham,GameCityis a celebration of offbeat and independent game creation. Featuring talks, classes and discussions as well as an “open arcade” of playable demos its one of the most interesting and inclusive events on the games industry calendar.This year, we’ll be running regular video interviews with developers attending the festival, and we’re starting with Mitu Khandaker-Kokoris, creator of the science fiction adventureRedshirt, a clever, funny parody of social media.Here, she talks about the forthcoming iOS version of her game, as well as the appeal of GameCity, which this year has its own dedicated venue, a five-story gaming megaplex in the city centre.GameCity festival returns with a new home – and Guardian YouTube show
A third of British children now have their own tablet,according to the latest figuresfrom communications regulator Ofcom. It’s a fair bet that those devices will be getting plenty of usage during half-term, which is this week in many parts of England.Not as a replacement for physical activities – from painting and reading to climbing trees or riding bikes – but to complement them, with digital creativity, storytelling and education for children’s downtime.Wondering what to download if your children are using Android devices? Here are some recommendations of recent releases that are well worth a look. And please chip in with your own recommendations in the comments section.Toca Mini (£1.99)Developer Toca Boca is a reliable source of inventive, playful children’s apps, and Toca Mini is the current favourite of my own kids. It involves creating mini dolls using colour, stamps and facial parts, with huge scope for creativity whether they’re making new characters or modelling their favourites from TV or books. It also proved a spur for my children to try making figures in the real world too, once the tablet had been put away.The Very Hungry Caterpillar (£2.99)Eric Carle’s book about a caterpillar who chomps its way through... well, just about every foodstuff in sight remains a classic. Its latest incarnation is an app from developer StoryToys. Rather than mirror the original story, it tries to add something new with a series of mini-games involving counting, sorting and memory. The graphics do a great job of bringing Carle’s iconic illustrations to life.Makies Fashion (£1.99)This is brand new from MakieLab, the British startup that mixes 3D-printed dolls with mobile games. It’s a fashion-oriented game for children, encouraging them to create clothes for their virtual characters and then send them down a catwalk – complete with a photography feature. It’s just as well-crafted as the real dolls that the company sells.Moonbeeps: Fireflies (£1.83)Moonbot Studios work across apps and animation, and had one of the first big children’s hits on iOS with their The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr Morris Lessmore app back in the day. Fireflies is part of their new series of apps though, with Android support from the start. It’s a playful mission to catch fireflies in a forest, collecting them in a jar and mixing up their colours. A relaxing treat for young children.BBC CBeebies Storytime (Free)Available in the UK, this is the second official app from the BBC’s pre-school TV channel CBeebies, focusing on stories rather than the games in itsCBeebies Playtimeapp. This time, the emphasis is on six stories based on popular shows: Something Special, Charlie and Lola, The Octonauts, Old Jack’s Boat, Show Me Show Me and Grandpa in My Pocket. It’s easy enough for young children to use, but includes reading development information for parents.Me Comics (Free + IAP)I grew up with the Beano in printed form, but my children have discovered Dennis and friends through Me Comics, which is a sign of the times. It’s part digital-comics store and part reader app, with individual comics sold for 69p and up as in-app purchases (the “IAP” above). The selection includes an array of Disney characters as well as Transformers and My Little Pony, with a fun feature enabling kids and parents to record their own voices for the narration.Endless Reader (Free + IAP)US developer Originator made its name with the marvellous Endless Alphabet app, and this is the follow-up. It teaches “sight words” through a mixture of interactivity and animation: children drag letters in to place to spell the words, before seeing a troop of colourful monsters act them out. Its humour bears many repeated viewings, while its in-app purchases for new word packs are under parents’ control.Dr. Panda’s Restaurant 2 (£1.79)Developer TribePlay has a growing collection of Dr Panda apps, which are well worth exploring. This is one of the most recent: a sequel that sees children cooking up a storm in their own restaurant. There are more than 20 digital ingredients to experiment with, and various cooking methods from boiling to frying. Again, it’s an app that may – if my children are any guide – encourage your kids to help out in your real kitchen. For better or worse...Fiete – A day on the farm (£2.35)There’s real craft and charm to this app, just like its predecessors Fiete, Fiete Match and Fiete Christmas. It’s set on a farm, with children helping the three characters go about their daily tasks: feeding animals, shearing sheep, milking cows and so on. It’s relaxed, lovely to look at, and the perfect follow-up to visiting a farm in the real world.Mr. Cupcake Has The Sprinkles (£1.80)The founder of developer Mighty Yeti Studios used to make shows for Nickelodeon and Disney, and you can see that pedigree in his company’s first Android app. This is a storybook with a pleasingly-sideways sense of humour, as Mr Cupcake sets off to a friend’s birthday party while puzzling over a strange crunching noise. There’s plenty of things to tap on, and plenty to laugh at too.Tynker Premium (£2.93)Tynker is one of the growing number of apps aiming to get children interested in computer programming. Here, that involves completing more than 200 “puzzle adventures” that introduce logic, loops and subroutines in an accessible way. A separate creation mode then gets children to start making their own games, using the skills that they’ve learned. This isn’t about shoving kids into coding to turn them into the next rich startup founder – it’s about having fun in a creative way.Night Zookeeper (Free)This isn’t an app that you download from the Google Play store: it’s a website designed to work within tablets’ web browsers. It’s a fab idea though: a creative community based around a zoo full of magical animals that children draw themselves, with digital story-books that unlock featuring them, and a light gaming element where they defend the zoo from invaders. It’s free to use, but as parents you can choose to pay £5 a month or £27 for permanent access for all your children – which gets them a physical Fan Club pack sent through the post.That’s a dozen to get you started, with some recommendations from previous roundups in the links below. But if your children have been enjoying other Android apps, please do tell other parents about them by posting a comment.•30 best Android apps for kids in 2014•50 best Android apps for kids from 2013
Ask most people to name a board game and they’re likely to mention Scrabble, Monopoly or Cluedo – possibly adding an anecdote about a wet weekend in Margate for good measure.But while these mass-market titles are already household names, in recent years, a community of independent designers and publishers has brought a new wave of innovation and creativity to the tabletop gaming industry.One of the most successful productions of this board game renaissance is Ticket to Ride. Released in 2004, it casts players as travellers crossing North America in the age of steam.Played on a lavishly illustrated map of the United States and Canada, the game is deceptively simple. Most turns see players taking one of two actions – adding cards to their hand or playing cards to claim routes between cities on the board. But the simplicity masks hidden depth. Each player also receives cards listing pairs of cities. Link those cities up by the end of the game and you’ll receive bonus points. Fail, and you’ll take a penalty that could drop you from first to last place.This makes Ticket to Ride a game of strategy, subtlety and opportunism. It asks players to make constant tactical decisions. Should you claim routes that work to your advantage, or ones which block off options for your opponents? Should you take the most direct route between your objective cities, or a more roundabout path to avoid giving away your plans?Sales of $150mIt’s a thoughtful and understated example of game design – and in the 10 years since Ticket to Ride was first published it’s proven extremely popular. In an industry where a game with sales in the five figures can be considered a hit, Ticket to Ride has sold over three million copies and generated retail sales of more than $150m (£93.3m).For all its success, though, the game came close to never being published.In 2003 its designer, Alan R Moon was on the verge of giving up. He had spent two decades in a succession of low-paid jobs, working on game designs in his spare time. The financial hardship was taking its toll.“I wasn’t making much money at it, that’s for sure”, Moon said. “I was working as a waiter to give myself some flexibility, but in truth I was working too many hours and I had less and less time to devote to design.”A lifelong gamer, some of Moon’s most enduring childhood memories are of family Risk and Monopoly sessions. But unlike many of his peers, he never stopped playing. By the time he graduated from university there was one thing he wanted to do above all else: design a best-selling board game.But while his designs were well-received by niche “hobbyist” gamers, none sold well enough to provide him with a steady income. The success of Ticket to Ride saved him from having to get a “normal job”, he says.“The idea for it came to me when I was out for a walk one day. I was frustrated. I’d just tested a design for a train game with friends and it hadn’t worked at all – it was too complicated.“Suddenly the idea for Ticket to Ride just came into my head pretty much fully formed. I couldn’t wait to get home and get a prototype together.”Moon sent his design to three publishers. This first two didn’t reply, but the third offered him a meeting.“I remember when Alan first showed us the game,” said Eric Hautemont, co-founder of game publisher Days of Wonder.“We started playing a couple of rounds. Suddenly he swept all the pieces off the board and said: ‘Well, now you get the idea.’ We just gasped and said ‘Hey, what are you doing? We were playing!’ A few weeks later we called Alan and told him we wanted to publish the game.”Ticket to Ride sold well, and in 2004 it received the Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year) award, considered the highest accolade in the industry. But interest in the game surged when its publishers decided to make it available for free online.“The rationale was that we wanted to get as many people playing as possible”, said Hautemont. “If you stand on the street and hand out free copies of a game to people, you could check back a year later and nine out of 10 of them won’t have taken it out of the box. People buy games like Monopoly because they’re already familiar with them, and this was a way to make people familiar with Ticket to Ride.”Playing 40 hours per weekThe company found users were spending long periods playing online – some clocked up over 40 hours a week. Today there are players who have completed over 100,000 games.And, said Hautemont, sales of the physical game increased by around 30% after the launch of the online version. They spiked again when the company released versions of the game for the iPhone and iPad – reaching a level of popularity which has surprised even its creator.“Originally I thought: ‘Why would you want to let people play the thing for free? They’ll never buy the board game”, said Moon. “But I was absolutely wrong. The internet hasn’t hurt board gaming at all. In fact it’s just the opposite. People are finding out about games they might otherwise never have heard of. They get them on their iPhones and want to play them for real.“And a big part of that is the social aspect - just sitting down around a table with other people. That’s something you don’t get from electronics, and I think it’s why new people are still coming to the game 10 years on.”The distributor of Ticket to Ride paid travel and accommodation expenses for Owen Duffy to conduct interviews at the game’s 10thanniversary party in Paris.
Taylor Swift fans who pre-ordered her latest album 1989 are waking up today to a notification from Apple that it’s available to download from iTunes – the latest high-profile album to shun streaming services like Spotify in favour of Apple’s music downloads store.That puts Swift in the company of big artists including Beyoncé, Coldplay and U2 in 2014 so far, showing iTunes’ continued clout within the music industry. But the rise of streaming may be eroding that status faster than Apple or its label partners had expected.The Wall Street Journal is responsible for the latest claim on that score,reporting that music sales on the iTunes store“have fallen 13% to 14% world-wide since the start of the year”, representing a much faster decline than in 2013.Although the statistic is startling, the trend is no surprise within the music industry. Earlier in October, figures released by Nielsen – the company that tracks music sales in the US – revealed thatdownload sales had fallen 12.9% therein the first nine months of 2014.Meanwhile, music industry analyst Mark Mulligan of Midia Researchpublished a report in Augustclaiming that 30% of consumers are now streaming music; that 23% of those people used to buy more than one album a month but no longer do so; and that 45% of all music downloaders are also now music streamers.Spotify and its rivals are expanding rapidly globally and signing up new users – Spotify went from 24 million active users in March 2013 to40 million by May 2014, and 50m now according to multiple sources within labels – with many of their early adopters being exactly the kind of people who used to spend money within iTunes.In the UK, the10.2 billion songs streamed in the first nine months of 2014was nearly double the 5.4 billion streamed in the same period in 2013, with 300 million tracks now streamed every week – a reflection of the format’s growing popularity.A decline in iTunes music sales is no surprise, then, and the impact is being felt beyond Apple’s iTunes store.Mobile app Shazam, for example, has seen the number of songs bought by its users every dayfall from 1m in March 2013 to 400,000 in September 2014, even though the app’s number of active users has risen from60 million in May 2013to100 million in August 2014.Apple is already looking beyond downloads, having bought Beats Electronics – including its Beats Music streaming service – for $3bn earlier in 2014. The Wall Street Journal claims that Beats Music will be relaunched in 2015 “as part of iTunes”, backing up aprevious report by TechCrunch.Simply preloading Beats Music on every iOS device with a lengthy free trial would present a major challenge to rival services, but Apple may also use price as a weapon, if recent reports that the company is negotiating with labels and publishers tohalve Beats Music’s monthly subscription cost to $5.At a time when some musicians are complaining about the royalties they receive from streams of their work, cutting the price of a streaming subscription sounds like a controversial move. But Apple may have scale on its side.According to music industry body the IFPI,more than 28m people were paying for a streaming music subscriptionat the end of 2013. Meanwhile, Apple sold 169.2m iPhones in its last financial year alone, which ended on 28 September 2014.If it can convert even 10% of iPhone buyers in 2015 to a $5 monthly music subscription, that could be tens of millions of new paying subscribers – or more if you take a more optimistic approach and start from the figure of800 million iTunes accountsreported by Apple chief executive Tim Cook in April 2014.The headache for the music industry is how much an Apple music subscription would further accelerate the decline in sales of downloads, as well as how much it would eat into the $10 subscriptions of rival streaming services.Spotify has already made its move into half-price subscriptions however,introducing a family planthrough which subscribers can add up to four additional accounts for $4.99 each for family members.•Five challenges looming for Spotify and streaming music•Spotify vs musicians: 10 things to read to understand the debate•Streaming music: what next for Apple, YouTube and Spotify?
What stories have caught your interest this morning? Make your recommendations in the comments, and tomorrow we’ll include (with credit, obviously) a selection in this daily post.The “GamerGate” controversy remains hugely polarising, and brands are being sucked in to the morass.Notably Intel and Adobe, who both faced pressure from GamerGate supporters to cut their ties with specific websites, and whose seemingly-supportive response was then attacked by critics of the virulent misogynistic side of GamerGate.Now trade siteAdAge has dug a little deeperinto how brands are viewing the controversy, which makes for interesting reading whatever your stance.“Even if Gamergater calls for advertiser boycotts don’t push marketers to withdraw ads, marketers are still seeing their in-boxes and phones exploding with rage. And with budget-planning season for 2015 underway, those publishers causing advertisers grief could easily be left off plans,” it explains.The article quotes one publishing sales executive complaining “advertisers don’t know what the fuck this is” before noting the risks to brands if they take decisions over advertising without, to borrow that phrase, knowing what the f*** this is.“This is the conundrum brands are in: Every GamerGate gripe – even if legitimate – will be linked to the vile elements of the group. So giving in is seen as siding with the worst elements of it. So far, those not responding are in better shape than those who have.”Is that true? Should brands be remaining above this particular fray, or should they be engaging with the debate – if not the abuse and harassment? Can brands play a role in lifting the tone of GamerGate, or do they risk fuelling its worst elements?Can advertisers pulling their spending (or threatening to) in order to sway editorial policy ever be compatible with a movement calling for “ethics in games journalism”? And what should Adobe and Intel be doing next, now they’ve got involved in GamerGate rather than not responding?The comments thread is open for your thoughts. Meanwhile, here are some other technology talking points from the weekend:Stephen Hawking is on Facebook &gt;&gt; FacebookBesides posting his ALS ice bucket challenge, he’s talking space race, pigeons and Richard Dawkins:I greatly enjoyed the STARMUS festival. It is a combination of science and rock music, both of which I love. I was interested in the talks by the astronauts and why the Soviet Union didn’t beat Neil Armstrong to the Moon. I will have to read the transcript, because I didn’t understand the translation. I enjoyed hearing how Bob Wilson eliminated pigeons, they thought the microwave background was caused by pigeon droppings, and Richard Dawkins on alien life. Some people say I’m an alien myself, with my robot voice.“And the universe of Facebook just became a lot brighter,” replied one fan, amid an outpouring of genuine affection and respect. We’re looking forward to finding out what Game of Thrones cast member he is...This man just sold Ebola.com for $200,000 &gt;&gt; The VergeTiming is clearly everything in the domain speculation world. Chris Welch:Just a few weeks ago, businessman Jon Schultz was hoping to capitalize on news headlines around the globe and wanted to sell the Ebola.com domain for around $150,000. He’s managed to rake in even more than that. After buying Ebola.com for $13,500 in 2008, Schultz’s Blue String Ventures just flipped the domain for $200,000. According to this SEC filing, the buyer is a Russian company called Weed Growth Fund, which is paying $50,000 in cash and handing over 19,192 shares it holds in another pot-focused company, Cannabis Sativa. Those are valued at around $164,000. Based in Nevada, Cannabis Sativa is led by two-term New Mexico governor Gary Johnson and aims to grow its business by marketing marijuana products for recreational and medical use as legalization becomes more common around the world. Only a few days ago, Johnson said, “We actually believe we have efficacy with regard to treating Ebola.”Well, at least you’ll feel more relaxed about the situation. Possibly.The Physics of the Hendo HoverboardRhett Allain:The physics for levitation is all there. You just need to work on the engineering to get a hoverboard to work…. Ok, so the physics for this type of hoverboard seems possible. Looking at other sites talking about this online, I am fairly certain it’s real. One last physics note: I’m really not sure if a hoverboard powered by electromagnetic repulsion would be frictionless. I suspect there would be some type of electromagnetic drag as the coil moved over the metal surface – but I could be wrong.Actual science? There’s no place for that in modern crowdfunding campaigns…Apple’s Porn Policy &gt;&gt; MediumCarl Smith:When I asked how Apple was naughty, one of our developers said, “they sent us a picture of a guy masturbating.” Fucking what???? Apple, the company that created the iPod, Apple? “Yup.” It turns out Apple thought the best way to tell us our app could be used to surf porn was to surf for porn using our app. Then send us some pictures and say take a look at these! Except they said, “Please see the attached screenshot for more information.” So with no warning… CLICK — Well hello there handsome!Well, they do say a picture tells a thousand words. Serious response: you can use Apple’s own Safari app to find this kind of imagery. Slightly-more-flippant thought: If pictures of penis-in-hand men are unwanted on the App Store, has anyone warned Tinder?Looksery Launches A Video Chatting App That Makes You Look More Attractive &gt;&gt; TechCrunchSarah Perez:Want to look more attractive on video? Or just different? Earlier this year, a company calledLooksery popped up on Kickstarter to raise crowdfunding for a new kind of mobile video chat application that allows users to look more attractive on video using special effects that can remove blemishes, let you change your eye color, slim your face, and more. The app, which is live as of today on the iTunes App Store, also lets you transform your face into an avatar for a bit of fun, too… you can chat as a panda, a gecko, a grumpy cat, a zombie, a monster or even a flaming skull.The problem with this sort of thing comes when you meet up IRL with the person you’ve been video-chatting with, and they realise your face isn’t what it seemed. “You’re not even a TINY bit like a panda!”Over to you...Give your views on the stories above, and make your own recommendation for reading material today.

There are brief moments withinBayonetta 2that hint at a sense of tranquillity. Flashes of Henry Mancini’s easy listening classic Moon River for example, or a fleeting pause for the heroine – a modern witch – to smile in slow motion to camera. But don’t be fooled. This a game of excess and spectacle, where rare hints at understatement merely contrast with and hence emphasise its knack for sensory mauling.Bayonetta 2is – as was its predecessor – over the top, ludicrous and simply brilliant.Developer Platinum Games have crafted an elegant action game focused on brawling, which overflows with lavish level design, accessible but intricate combat mechanics, and intensely dramatic set pieces.Realised as increasingly overwhelming skirmishes, the game is set in a netherworld where angels and demons toy with humanity’s fate. It’s a place that is knowingly hammy, and one where its empowered heroine’s confident, playful sexuality will not be to everybody’s tastes. Yet those who tackle it will find a masterfully built game with enough depth to demand repeated playthroughs.Solitary campaign mode aside, there’s also an enjoyable online multiplayer, while the special edition comes bundled with a reworking of the 2009 original. One might argue thatBayonetta 2merely offers more of the same, delivered so expertly once before, but it has been realised so pefectly here that it’s been well worth the five-year wait.
Australia’s privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, does not have jurisdiction to monitor all local and state agencies who access Australians’ personal phone and web data under commonwealth laws.TheOffice of the Australian Information Commissioner released its annual reportlast week, which detailed record numbers of data breach complaints against government agencies and private companies.In an interview with Guardian Australia, Pilgrim said government agencies and private organisations had “some way to go” to keep up with the most up-to-date security measures.The annual report comes at a time when the federal government is expected to soon introduce a bill that will force telecommunications companies to retain Australian’s personal phone and web browsing data, commonly known as “metadata”, for two years.The federal government and enforcement agencies have argued this is an important measure for combating crime and responding to terrorism threats.Australia’s federal Privacy Act covers commonwealth government agencies and private organisations, which would include telecommunications providers.But state, territory and local government agencies are not covered by the act, despite these agencies being able to access metadata under the federal Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act.Pilgrim told Guardian Australia: “It comes down to the coverage of the Privacy Act. We can start from the perspective that all Australian government agencies – that is commonwealth government agencies – that are covered by the Privacy Act need to comply with the same data security standards as do the private sector organisations.“The issue then is what is the breadth of those agencies that are collecting that information in these circumstances, and then you’d need to look at what happens with those organisations that are not covered by the Privacy Act.”While there are some obligations to prevent the disclosure of information under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, the Privacy Act has a much more comprehensive framework of privacy principles that agencies must comply with.The act also allows individuals to seek redress that can involve fines or sanctions imposed by the privacy commissioner, but none of these measures will be available if breaches arise from state or local government agencies misusing personal information.Instead individuals will be left to seek recourse within state or territory regimes, which vary in their effectiveness and adds to an already complex interaction of state and federal powers.When asked about the mandatory data retention proposals, Pilgrim said that if organisations were retaining or collecting new datasets, he would expect them to “undertake appropriate risk assessments to ensure that the security systems they have in place are sufficient to protect that information”.“I would suggest that the more sensitive information organisations and agencies are collecting, the more they need to focus on making sure they’ve got the right level of security in place, the strongest types of security to protect that information, the most up-to-date security measures in place.”He also added that “the focus on data security in the coming year is going to be a key area for all organisations, both government and private sector”.Accessing Australians’ personal data under telecommunications interception laws has resulted in data breaches occurring in the past.In AugustGuardian Australia revealed the Australian Federal Policewas involved in an embarrassing breach where details of a criminal investigation were posted on a publicly available website due to poorly redacted documents, potentially jeopardising an operation.Pilgrim added that he had seen an increasing awareness in the community of privacy rights.“What I’ve seen in quite a number of years working in this area is that every year the community do continue to exercise their rights in increasing number. People are becoming more aware, particularly in the online environment, of how their personal information is being used,” he said.The Office of the Australian Commissioner, which Pilgrim’s role is part of,is set to be abolishedin a bill introduced by the federal government. If the legislation succeeds in passing, Pilgrim’s office will become part of the Australian Human Rights Commission.
Price £18,265MPG up to 74.3Top speed 118mphBack in 2006, when Nissan first dropped the “crossover” on to an unsuspecting motoring public, we were all snuffling around like misguided moles, happy in the knowledge that a family hatchback was just that: a boring car with four doors and a sensible boot. What fools we were!Nissan saw things very differently. They thought the family hatchback should be chunky and funky. They thought it should look like a 4x4 even though it was just for cities and school runs. They thought it should be elevated, durable, modern… And so they invented theQashqai.Sadly, Nissan also thought their new car had to be edgy, challenging and modern – designspeak for coyote ugly. That high back, the overbite, the unsettling dimensions: it all added up to make the crossover one of the most ungainly body shapes on the road.Despite that, or maybe because of that, the Qashqai has won friends all over the world. So many, in fact, that it’s totally outstripped all Nissan’s hopes and sold at twice the rate they expected.Inside story: the well-designed interior of the roomy new Qashqai.The Qashqai is an all-British affair. It’s designed in Paddington, its technical centre is in Cranfield, it’s marketed from Rickmansworth and it’s built in Sunderland. Along with the Note and the Juke (another assault on the eyeballs), Nissan Sunderland has now made more than 7m vehicles – 80% of which have been exported to 97 markets around the planet. The Qashqai is, in fact (dad-joke alert), a cashcow!So what’s this second-generation model like? Well, like the outgoing one, it is elevated, durable, modern – and still ugly. It now has a weirdly protruding nose and an assertive stance that makes it look aggressive. If the first was a crossover, then this has truly crossed over. It’s now more SUV than saloon.Qashqai Mk II is longer and wider than Mk I, which results in increased cabin space. But the five-door option with two extra seats in the boot is no longer offered. Power comes from a choice of four engines: 1.2- and 1.6-litre turbo petrols, plus 1.5- and 1.6-litre diesels. The diesel engines come from Nissan’s sister company, Renault. These days motor manufacturers hop in and out of bed with each other faster than suburban swingers. Economy is impressively frugal, especially in the 1.5dCi diesel, which will do an amazing 74.3 miles to the gallon.The Qashqai comes in three trim levels, all of which feature a generous range of smart in-car wizardry. Among the highlights are automatic headlamp-dipping, moving-object detection and low-speed collision avoidance.The car also boasts some very fancy new technology. “Active trace control torque vectoring” is a complicated way of saying the car brakes its wheels individually to help you stay in control around high-speed bends. “Body motion control” means the car constantly dabs the brakes to smooth out movement over bumps and rough roads. Both result in an extremely comfortable, composed and controlled ride.Inside, the Qashqai is a lot plusher than you would expect for a family workhorse. It’s practical and tough, yet has an unmistakable air of no corner having been cut in production. Considering all this, it comes as no surprise thatWhatCar?named the Qashqai its car of the year for 2014.And best of all, you don’t have to look at it when you are driving…Revving up on Regent StreetClassic appeal: come and enjoy the vintage motors on Regent Street.On Saturday 1 November, Regent Street, London W1 will see the return of the annual Regent Street Motor Show, the UK’s largest free-to-view motoring extravaganza. From Piccadilly Circus to Oxford Circus, the capital’s world-famous shopping street will be closed to through traffic, making way for hundreds of display cars that will be on show in the middle of the street, including vintage and performance cars, racing cars, family and eco cars. Featured in the Bonhams Veteran Car Zone, there will also be 100 veteran cars in the EFG International Concours d’Elegance which will all be taking part in the annual Bonhams London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, the next day. Now in its 10th year, the Regent Street Motor Show attracts a large number of manufacturers keen to display their newest products to an audience made up of car fanatics, tourists and shoppers alike. Last year saw a record 400,000 visitors come to the Mile of Style to peruse the huge amount of machinery on display. It’s a fantastic day out, totally free and a lot more fun than Christmas shopping, so why not go along and see for yourself? For more details, go toregentstreetmotorshow.comDon’t drink and driveIt’s the party season, it’s dark and the roads can be treacherously slippery – all the more reason therefore to be incredibly careful you don’t drink and drive. On top of that, new evidence suggests that one in five convicted drink drivers are caught the morning after, often due to unintentional drink driving. Just 3-4 drinks the night before could be enough to put you over the limit the next day. An award-winning pocket-sized breathalyser from Alcosense could be a real lifesaver.

Earlier this year engineer Dr Craig Labovitz testified before the US House of Representatives judiciary subcommittee on regulatory reform, commercial and antitrust law. Labovitz is co-founder and chief executive ofDeepfield, an outfit that sells software to enable companies to compile detailed analytics on traffic within their computer networks. The hearing was on the proposed merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable and the impact it was likely to have on competition in the video and broadband market. In the landscape of dysfunctional, viciously partisan US politics, this hearing was the equivalent of rustling in the undergrowth, and yet in the course of his testimonyLabovitz saidsomething that laid bare the new realities of our networked world.“Whereas internet traffic was once broadly distributed across thousands of companies,” he told the subcommittee, “we found that by 2009 half of all internet traffic originated in less than 150 large content and content-distribution companies. By May of 2014, this number had dropped by a factor of five. Today, just 30 companies, including Netflix and Google, contribute on average more than one half of all internet traffic in the United States during prime-time hours.”To those of us who were accustomed to thinking of the internet as a glorious, distributed, anarchic, many-to-many communication network in which anyone could become a global publisher, corporate gatekeepers had lost their power and peer-to-peer sharing was becoming the liberating norm, Labovitz’s brusque summary comes as a rude shock. Why? Because what he was really saying is that the internet is well on its way to being captured by giant corporations – just as the Columbia law professor Tim Wu speculated it might be inThe Master Switch, his magisterial history of 20th-century communications technologies.In that book, Wu recounted the history of telephone, movie, radio and TV technologies in the US. All of them had started out as creative, anarchic, open and innovative technologies but over time each had been captured by corporate interests. In some cases (eg the telephone) this happened with the co-operation of the state, but in most cases it happened because visionary entrepreneurs offered consumers propositions that they found irresistible. But the result was always the same: corporate capture of the technology and the medium. And the most insidious thing, Wu wrote, was that this process of closure doesn’t involve any kind of authoritarian takeover. It comes, not as a bitter pill, but as a “sweet pill, as a tabloid, easy to swallow”. Most of the corporate masters of 20th-century media delivered a consumer product that was better than what went before – which is what consumers went for and what led these industries towards closure.At the end of his book, Wu posed the 64-trillion-dollar question: would the internet also fall victim to this cycle? For years, many of us thought that it wouldn’t: it was too decentralised, too empowering of ordinary people, too anarchic and creative to succumb to that kind of control.Labovitz’s testimony suggests that we were wrong. We believed that the internet was, in the words of Elisabeth Murdoch, a “sit-up, not a lean-back” medium. It would supplant the old media ecosystem in which powerful corporations decided what content would be produced and then beamed that content down channels that they controlled to essentially passive consumers. That was the world embodied by the couch potato, a world in which the phrase “user-generated content” was an oxymoron.What we failed to appreciate was the passivity of most of humanity and its inexhaustible appetite for consumption, entertainment and “infotainment”. The spread of high-speed broadband connections did not liberate human creativity but instead created Couch Potato 2.0, a creature that sees the internet mostly as zillion-channel TV. In that sense, it’s no accident that the corporations which now dominate network traffic are outfits like Google and Netflix, beaming YouTube and movies to you in the comfort of your own settee.Of course the internet of our (utopian) dreams hasn’t ceased to exist. It’s just that it’s becoming a minority sport. You can still create your own website, or start a blog, become a global publisher – and join the long tail of largely unnoticed content, while stuff from Netflix et al swamps the net. You can still makeLOLcat videosand screen them via YouTube, Vine or Vimeo; tweet your views and post your status updates to your heart’s content. But you can only do so courtesy of the giant corporations that own and control the platforms on which this user-generated content appears and which – as Labovitz’s testimony shows – are reconfiguring the network for their purposes rather than ours. Sad, isn’t it? We had our chance, and we blew it.
Everything aboutDisney Magical Worldis nice. The people are nice. The little town of Castleton is nice. The tasks you take on for its residents (a slightly odd mix of classic Disney characters and ever-smiling Mii-types) are nice. In fact, all progress within the game is made by being nice. Catch fish (and throw them back), grow plants, prepare tasty snacks, run errands, wear co-ordinated outfits and greet everyone with a cheery wave, joyful leap or little dance. But its game mechanics and sheer playability are also really rather nice.After an unnecessarily protracted introductory section,Disney Magical Worldsettles down to offers several magical worlds; Cinderella Land, Winnie the Pooh’s Hundred Acre Wood, Aladdin Land and Alice in Wonderland World, all accessible from the town’s central square, and designed by people who clearly know a thing or two about theme parks. These unlock as you buy outfits from Daisy Duck, furniture from Chip and Dale, and as you rid the various worlds of ghosts in bite-sized and thoroughly enjoyable little quests, with a range of (accessorised) magic wands. Unterstandably,Disney Magical Worldreally, really wants you to have a nice day. And if you can bear how relentlessly sweet it is, you surely will.

Like fusion power or jet-packs, virtual reality has always been 20 years away.Matrix-inspired dreams of being transported via headset to another realm have been held back by poor graphics, high costs and, most damagingly, nausea. Virtual reality has had an unfortunate habit of making the users really sick. Products have been announced with fanfare, come and then slipped away.Now it seems that something more substantial might be afoot. Last week it was announced that Magic Leap, a mysterious startup, had raised $542m in funding, a gargantuan figure even by the standards of Silicon Valley, valuing the company at around $2bn. The investors are also of an unusually high calibre, including Google and the semiconductor magnate, Qualcomm. More impressive still is that nobody has a clear idea about what exactly Magic Leap does.In the funding announcement, CEO Rony Abovitz explained that the company was building a “hardware, software, firmware and development platform” that promises to be the next generation of interfaces. Getting rid of dependence on screens, in other words. He has not specified what exactly the format will be, but promised that it would not be a clunky headset.Thomas Cull, another investor, said: “I’m not sure exactly what the category will be called but it augments and brings you into a world in a completely realistic, immersive way without taxing your eyes or brain.”There is not much in the way of detail. Google (and it is Google Inc, the core business, rather than its investment arms, that has invested in Magic Leap) can afford to throw money at things that turn out not to work. Still, the investors must have been shown something to excite them: investing in a product that’s not yet profitable is par for the course, but ploughing so much into something that doesn’t exist yet is another matter.“The thorny problem in this area has always been the user interface,” says Mike Butcher, of TechCrunch. “You could argue that it fell at the first hurdle in the form of Google Glass, which everyone thought would revolutionise things but which hasn’t. But if the new device is capable of projecting objects in this fashion, that would be an entirely new platform – for creative content, and also, surprise surprise, advertising.”Patents filed in the US suggest that the new display will be able to create “light fields” or 3D patterns of light rays. This would let your eyes focus on depth as they do in the real world, rather than remaining focused on the flat screen immediately in front of them. Other descriptions mention infra-red sensors and eye-tracking cameras to help the device react to the external environment. Its publicity shots show a flying elephant and a yellow submarine on a town street, hints that augmented reality will play a big part.Magic Leap is not the only virtual reality game in town. In July, Facebook completed a $2bn purchase of Oculus Rift, a more traditional headset system. Oculus Rift has so far been aimed at the sophisticated video games market, a long way from the low-fiFarmVille-style titles usually associated with Facebook. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he saw his new company’s social media potential, but then he would. Some commentators suggested that he bought the firm only because he thought it was cool, rather than seeing a business case for it.There are cautionary tales in similar fields. Digital Domain Media Group was a successful digital effects company, best known for its work onTitanic. It went public in 2011 with a high-profile hologram performance of Tupac at Coachella music and arts festival in April 2012. Five months later it filed for bankruptcy.“There is always a risk in this kind of investment,” adds Butcher. “But for a company like Google, they specialise in these kinds of moonshots. We saw it with advertising, and now with their driverless cars. For them, the much greater risk is of missing out on the next big thing.”
Made by Shinji Mikami, the man responsible for the awesome Resident Evil 4, The Evil Within has top survival-horror pedigree. It also adheres rigidly to genre cliches, featuring well-worn motifs such as the deserted mansion and twisted hospital, spliced with the stealth and messy, desperate combat perfected in The Last Of Us. Making up for a lack of scares by being very nasty, the opening scenes alone generate more spilled claret than a Conservative club ball. Its generally rewarding combat and level of challenge are let down by dingy scenery and slightly awkward third-person action, where the hero often seems to be crouching in front of the very thing you’re trying to look at. The script and voice acting are no better, and the central character, Detective Castellanos, has a personality somewhere between a brick and the speaking clock. His cohorts are just as dissociated, remaining inexplicably calm in the face of endless explosive disembowelment.ALSO OUT THIS WEEKProject Spark, Xbox OneProject Spark lets you make your own games. Starting with a blank digital canvas, you add scenery, props, characters and a hero, giving each element a “brain” that tells it how to respond to everything from gravity to player input. From those basics you can cook up platform games, first-person shooters and zombie-apocalypse scenarios. The problem is that the resulting games aren’t much fun, and even the pre-packaged story levels falter, enemies getting stuck behind objects and items you’ve dropped floating in mid-air or gradually migrating offscreen during moments of plot exposition. The user-generated levels fare even worse. Despite noble ambitions, Project Spark’s output isn’t as compelling as minigames made with the similarly open-ended creative tools in LittleBigPlanet.Microsoft, £24.99-£29.99#gamergate newsAnyone who plays games regularly will know that their treatment of women can be abjectly sexist. A recent survey suggested that 76% of developers are male, and while there are an increasing number of games eschewing risible stereotypes, this is still an industry with a diversity problem.#gamergatestarted with an accusation – now debunked – that a female indie developer had traded sexual favours for positive reviews. It escalated into an online slanging match about ethics in games journalism, culminating in death threats to feminist blogger Anita Sarkeesian that forced her to cancel a public appearance. Away from the hyperbole, few would argue that games offer fair representation to the 52% (according to the Internet Advertising Bureau) of their audience that isn’t male, and it’s depressing that this conversation can’t be had without attracting the worst kind of trolling.
Great Queen Street runs through central London, from Covent Garden along to Holborn. At its eastern end is the site of the formerBlitz Club, where a plaque was recently placed to commemorateSpandau Ballet’s first gig there, 35 years ago. On the afternoon of its unveiling, I arrive to collect the band’s singer,Tony Hadley. The ceremony is running late, so I sit in the fury of London traffic and acquaint myself with the Seat Leon Cupra.It might be competing with the likes of theRenault Mégane RSor theVauxhall Astra VXR, but the Cupra’s more obvious comparison is theGolf GTI– the car on which it’s based, and with which it shares an engine. The Seat has considerably more clout – at 276bhp, 59bhp more than the GTI – and it has an extra gear. On our shuffle west through the city later, we won’t experience the Cupra’s full mettle, but for the time being its bucket seats make it a comfortable place to wait.“This is nice,” Hadley says as he climbs in. “It’s a Seat?” You have to marvel at the polish of the performer – forever grateful to be wherever they are. “Birmingham,” he might as well have said, “it’s wonderful to be here tonight.”Hadley and I chase ghosts through the city. “The Blitz was a wine bar,” he reminisces. “And then on Tuesday nights Steve Strange and Rusty Egan took it over and it became the Blitz Ritz Club.Boy Georgewas the hat-check chappie. And there was Marilyn, and God knows who else. It was a very creative place, and we were the musical guardians of it in a sense.”The Cupra isn’t yet the prince of hatchbacks but you sense its possibilities; a slight improvement in the handling would put it up there with the Mégane (for now, it’s a tad heavy-footed). It takes corners sweetly, thanks to its gigantic wheels – particularly the limited slip differential on the front ones. It makes a good, quiet city car.We edge our way through Soho, Hadley reminiscing about the 1980s (next week sees the release of a documentary about the band, Soul Boys of the Western World). “Back then London was a very different place,” he says. “In the late 70s and 80s it was a very exciting period for music, art, fashion. In the early days Blitz was very electronica and very angular, and the fashion was very futuristic – people dressing up likeCaptain Scarlet. You could still shock the establishment. London still is a very buzzy place, there’s a seediness about this area that I quite like...” He looks out of the window. “Oh!” he says. “There’sRobert Plant!”Tony Hadley.Photograph: Laura Barton/GuardianI drop Hadley at his hotel, and take the Cupra out for a proper run. As well as its speed (it’s the fastest hatchback on the market), it offers a range of driving profiles that allows you to move from Comfort to Sport to Cupra modes – though truthfully, these don’t feel overwhelmingly different. Still, there’s a dynamism to the Cupra that’s appealing, a sharpness to its drive and its look. It’s not quite Captain Scarlet, but has a sense of style and excitement all its own.SEAT Leon Cupra 280 PSPriceFrom £25,690Top speed155mphAcceleration0-62mph in 5.8 secondsCombined fuel consumption42.8mpgCO2emissions154g/kmEco rating6/10On the stereo‘One Direction – they remind me of the Monkees’• Follow Laura onTwitter
It is a video-game festival unlike any other video-game festival in the world. For the past decade, GameCity has taken over various venues around the centre of Nottingham, putting on a vast range of talks, special events and interactive sessions, as well as showing off hundreds of fascinating indie titles. It has seen classical concerts in beautiful medieval churches, live-action Resident Evil role-playing in abandoned hotel corridors and gastronomic adventures with game developer chefs.This year is a little different, mostly because GameCity has acquired a large new base. “We’ve taken over a five-floor building in the centre of Hockley as our main festival venue,” says the director Iain Simons. “It’s fantastic to be able to get to know a building a bit more and play around more with the weird spaces that this one in particular has available. Honestly, it starts to make us feel less like festival organisers and more like platform-holders, inviting people to make the best possible things in our place.”Starting on Saturday, there are lots of highlights to look out for.“We’re incredibly excited to be hosting a videogame in a swimming pool,” says Simons of AREEF, billed as the world’s first multiplayer underwater augmented-reality game, which will be shown at Nottingham’s Victoria Leisure Centre on Sunday. “We’re also crazy excited about our Live Text Adventures event on Thursday, when a collection of esteemed writers will deliver excitement to the public in real-time.”Likely to be a key event at the festival this year, Live Text Adventures will get games developers such as Zoe Quinn (Depression Quest), Chris Avellone (Planescape: Torment) and Ian Livingstone (Tomb Raider), to improvise a text-based adventure for the audience.“We’re also working with the new Gisborne Industries on a launch event at the Masonic Lodge in Nottingham,” says Iain, referring to the special event Mike Bithell is planning for his forthcoming Robin Hood game, Volume. “We’re also really excited to be working with the actual Sheriff of Nottingham to create a new signature playable event for the City. The Sheriff’s Gauntlet revives a centuries-old tradition across the whole city on the afternoon of Saturday 1 November.”The Guardian will also be holding a daily YouTube chat show, talking to developers and exhibitors from throughout the show, presented by me and the Observer writer Jordan Erica Webber.Importantly, GameCity is aimed at families, and at people interested in making games as well as playing them. The festival will be running various creative workshops throughout the week. “More than ever this year, GameCity is about two things,” says Simons. “We think that everybody should be able to play games, and we think that everybody should be able to make games.

The former partner of an MI6 whistleblower has described the “dangerous moral slide” of the UK’s intelligence services, comparing a 1996 assassination plot against then Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi to his treatment during the 2011 uprising.Annie Machon, former partner of the whistleblower David Shayler, said that British agents had worked alongside rebels in Libya in 1996 in a failed plot to try to kill the dictator, who took power in a 1969 coup. Shayler was imprisoned twice for exposing the plot.Yet in 2011, Machon said, Gaddafi’s downfall in which he was captured and killed by members of an uprising was closely reported and filmed. “The reporting of MI6 help [for the 1996 plot], of Gaddafi being pulled out of a drainpipe and buggered with a bayonet - nobody cared,” she said. “It says something that what was a dirty secret in 1996 was openly reported in 2011 - it’s a dangerous moral slide that we, as civilised nations, have taken in that time.”Speaking at the Playful conference in London on Friday, Machon paid tribute to Edward Snowden, who revealed details of surveillance by the US’s National Security Agency (NSA), for revealing the extent of modern surveillance and the invasion of privacy. Of the UK’s spy agency, she said: “GCHQ has prostituted itself the the NSA to the tune of million of dollars with no accountability or oversight - they tell the NSA ‘we can do stuff you can’t do’. We live in an endemic surveillance state now. Politicians say ‘we know the intelligence agencies are working within the law and protecting, not eroding, our freedoms’. But politicians don’t have a bastard clue what spies can get away with and Britain is the least accountable of all the western intelligence agencies.”Machon signed the Official Secrets Act when she joined MI5 in 1990 after an intensive 10-month recruitment process. She had wanted to work as a diplomat but was sent a mysterious letter which suggested other career possibilities. “I had no idea what I’d be doing the first day I walked through the door of MI5. All I knew was my paygrade and salary, but I had signed up to a secret world.”Machon described working as a general officer, arranging phone and physical surveillance of subjects. “When I first started reading transcripts of phone conversations it felt highly intrusive - information about their private lives and who they were having an affair with that even their families didn’t know. It becomes god-like … a massive sense of dislocation from the real world.”Shayler was sentenced to six months in prison in 2002 for releasing 28 classified documents to a national newspaper, which led to stories that MI5 held files on government ministers, failed to act on knowledge of IRA bomb plots, and carried out illegal phone surveillance. Shayler fled the UK with Machon three days before the first story was published and went into hiding in Europe for nearly a year, with Machon returning just once to the UK to “comfort our traumatised families”, none of whom had known about their work until they saw the story on the front pages.Machon also described an incident where a Libyan spy had attempted to pay them off in return for sharing British intelligence on Libya, which she said the couple declined. “We were not in the game of treachery.”She spoke of the personal cost of living a secret life when working in intelligence, and the dislocation of living a life fractured between a hidden and public life. “I cannot shake off the paranoia that I am being watched or followed,” she explained.“When we were under investigation our phone calls and emails were under surveillance but also our friends, who were under pressure to report back. That invasive lack of privacy can be very damaging to the human soul, and thanks to Snowden we know we are all living under that sense of a lack of privacy and surveillance.”Machon made a plea for whistleblowers to be supported by the press and public by focusing not on the “diversionary tactic” of their personal lives but on what they are trying to expose. “Snowden will not be the last but might be the bravest whistleblower in intelligence agency history.”
It’s time for this week’s roundup of the best new iPhone and iPad apps and games released on Apple’s App Store.As ever, the prices provided in brackets are for the initial download only: when an app uses in-app purchases, this will be listed as (Free + IAP).More interested in Android apps? They’re covered in a separate weeklyBest Android Apps roundup. But if it’s iOS you’re after, read on for this week’s selection.APPSCrumb: Ruby Tandoh Bakes (£2.49)Does Britain’s obsession with baking have to end with the climax of Great British Bake Off? Of course it doesn’t. This app from Random House features previous GBBO finalist Ruby Tandoh, with 45 baking recipes taking in loaves, muffins and cream buns. It’s very well presented too: with step-by-step instructions and photography to (hopefully) make sure your bakes are suitably great.iPhone / iPadFlickr for iPad (Free)It took a while, but photo-sharing service Flickr finally has a dedicated iPad app – released as a universal update to its existing iPhone version. It’s the Flickr users know (and often love) from its last desktop revamp, complete with full-screen images and a good large-touchscreen interface.iPad (already on iPhone)Inbox by Gmail (Free)This is Google’s new email app, sitting alongside Gmail rather than replacing it. For now, it’s invitation-only – but you can request one – with features aiming to declutter your inbox by grouping similar messages together, from travel details to receipts and promotions. Worth trying, when you get the opportunity.iPhoneToca Boo (£1.99)Kid-apps developer Toca Boca is on a fine run of creative, playful children’s apps, and Toca Boo is one of its best yet. It’s a Halloween-themed app that sees you chasing a family around their house dressed as a ghost, hiding behind furniture, then jumping out and giving them frights. Marvellously-spooky fun for children of all ages.iPhone / iPadFort McMoney (Free)This is a fascinating interactive TV project from Canada, exploring issues around energy and conservation through the lens of a town in Alberta. Your job is to play mayor, talking to citizens and taking decisions that will affect its future. Described as a “documentary game”, it’s technically innovative and thought-provoking.iPadRooms (Free)For now, Rooms is a ‘try this and see what you think’ recommendation, not a ‘this is really good’ recommendation – it’s too early to tell. The idea is a new, mobile-only way to create chat-rooms for posting text, photos and videos with friends, privately. Well, friends with iPhones, anyway, until an Android version comes out.iPhoneTimeline Nelson (£6.99)This is the latest history app from publisher Ballista Digital, co-founded by historian and TV presenter Dan Snow. It focuses on Lord Nelson and the British Navy, with plenty of source material thanks to a partnership with London’s National Maritime Museum. There’s lots to explore, from audio clips, videos and images to an interactive map of sea battles.iPadPixelmator (£2.99)If you want more from a photo-editing app than simple filters and cropping, Pixelmator may be just the thing. It’s a powerful yet easy-to-use image-editing app with more retouching tools than you can shake a (paintbrush) stick at, tapping Apple’s iCloud service to run across devices.iPadGoogle News &amp; Weather (Free)Google’s other new app this month came out without the same kind of fuss as for Inbox, but it could find an even bigger audience. It aggregates news and weather unfussily, helping you swipe between categories then tap on headlines to read them. Good for quick browsing when out and about.iPhone / iPadTeleStory (£1.99)Worried about your children spending too much time on the sofa watching TV? This app gets them up and about filming their own shows: an exercise in creative storytelling with plenty of themes and animations to get them started. Clever technology, but worthy aims too. And its own “global storytelling network” helps them get inspiration from other children too.iPhone / iPadAngry Birds Transformers ditches bird-flinging for stomping and shooting.GAMESAngry Birds Transformers (Free + IAP)The latest branded Angry Birds game is actually one of the most innovative in terms of its gameplay: bird-slinging is out, and stompy robots shooting and transforming into cars is very much in. It’s freemium, so expect timers and energy bars, but the game itself is fun. Read our full review for more details on that.iPhone / iPadBest Fiends (Free + IAP)There’s an Angry Birds connection to puzzle-battler game Best Fiends: some of its developer Seriously’s staff used to work at Rovio. This is very good, though: a game where you take little beasties to battle noxious slugs through match-three action, with your characters levelling up as they go. It’s Pokemon meets Puzzle &amp; Dragons, with impressive production values.iPhone / iPadSkylanders Trap Team (Free + IAP)This is a proper, full Skylanders game, complete with its own joypad and tablet stand to use with the Skylanders figures. New to the game? It’s a monster-battling fest aimed at children, with new features including the ability to trap beasts then play as them. You’ll need to buy the tablet starter pack to play the full game, so it’s an intriguing test of whether mobile gamers will pay console prices.iPadCrimsonland HD (Free + IAP)Can dual-stick shooters work well on touchscreen devices without sticks? Actually yes. Several games have proved it in the past, and Crimsonland HD is the latest. It’s an addictive monster-fest with a comfortingly-retro feel, complete with an interesting pay-what-you-like model to unlock the full game (assuming that you like paying either £2.99, £5.99 or £10.49).iPhone / iPadNew Words With Friends (Free + IAP)Scrabble-like digital board game Words With Friends is five years old, making it one of the grizzled veterans of the App Store. But this is a brand new, separate version from its publisher Zynga, with better features for finding opponents, more stats on how you’ve played and a dictionary to help find top-scoring words.iPhone / iPadSkullduggery! (£2.99)This game has already won a set of indie awards, and rightly so: it’s a quirky action game with a sense of fun: but also masses of playability. You play a tax-collecting skull – just go with it, okay? – flicking yourself around the screen to collect in the afterlife. It’s a stylish title that stands out from the App Store crowd.iPhone / iPadThe Lord of the Rings: Legends of Middle-earth (Free + IAP)Publisher Kabam’s game based on The Hobbit has been a big hit on smartphones and tablets, so now it’s turning its attention to Lord of the Rings. Based on the films and books, it sees you exploring Tolkien’s universe fighting, questing and falling in with a host of familiar characters. As with past Kabam titles, though, the key will be updates over the coming months (and even years) to add more content.iPhone / iPadSentinels of the Multiverse (£6.99)I was new to Sentinels of the Multiverse when this game appeared: the original is a card game that has found a healthy audience for its heroes’n’villains gameplay. Now it’s also available as a tablet game. Existing fans will appreciate it, but it could also be a way in for newcomers to what looks an absorbing game.iPadRetry (Free + IAP)If Flappy Bird was in a plane, he might be Retry. Although that’s selling the new game from Angry Birds publisher Rovio short: it has a number of original touches rather than just cloning this year’s big viral hit. You control a loop-the-looping biplane, making your way through levels – or simply crashing into things. Mostly the latter, in my case.iPhone / iPadZombie Highway 2 (Free + IAP)Finally, and with perfect timing for Halloween, comes this excellent racing game that’s far more than a spooky novelty. “Cars, Guns, and Zombies. What more could you want?” asks its App Store listing, but it looks and plays brilliantly too, with its application of in-app purchases not getting in the way of the fun.iPhone / iPadThat’s my choice, but what iOS apps and games have you been using recently? Make your recommendations – or give your views on the picks above – in the comments section.
The Moto X is Motorola’s first attempt at a true flagship smartphone, with a big screen, Android as Google intended it and advanced voice functions beyond most other smartphones.Motorola found great success with its sub-£130 Moto G, propelling the companyfrom zero to 6% market share in the UKin three months at the end of 2013, according to Kantar. Its 2013 Moto X, however, failed to achieve similar results.Solid, customisable designThe curved back tapers to thin, metal edges that feel good in the hand.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianThis year’s Moto X is a very different beast. The screen is much bigger – 5.2in compared to 4.7in – and the whole device a lot more powerful, with a top-of-the-line quad-core processor instead of 2013’s lower-powered dual-core processor.The phone is very solidly, built with a smooth metal frame around the outside and no give or flex. The back is a soft-touch plastic by default, but wood and leather options are available through Motorola’s Moto Maker phone customisation tool.At 9.9mm, it is significantly thicker than an iPhone 6 (6.9mm) or Samsung Galaxy S5 (8.1mm), but the curved back fits nicely in the hand and the tapered edges make it feel a lot thinner. The Moto X weighs 144g, 1g lighter than a 5.1in Galaxy S5, but 15g heavier than an 4.7in iPhone 6.The 5.2in 1080p OLED screen is crisp, vibrant and bright, while the Gorilla Glass 3 covering the display tapers nicely over the edges giving a feel of quality.The glass curves around the edges of the smartphone, while the a ribbed metal bar hides the top speaker.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianThe speaker used during phone calls hides under a ribbed metal strip. This isn’t good: it pulls out beard hairs, and even if you don’t have those it’s still a dust magnet.A front-facing music speaker hides under an identical strip at the bottom of the phone. The two cannot be paired to create stereo output, however.Like the iPhone 6, the Moto X pulls out beard hairs.The power button the side of the phone also has the ribbed metal effect, which is rough to touch but differentiates it from the smooth volume buttons.SpecificationsScreen:5.2in full HD OLEDProcessor:2.5 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801RAM:2GB of RAMStorage:16/32GB; no SD cardOperating system:Android 4.4.4 “Kitkat”Camera:13MP rear camera, 2MP front-facing cameraConnectivity:LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 with BLE and GPSDimensions:140.8 x 72.4 x 9.9 mmWeight:144gPowerThe headphones port in the top of the phone. The bottom of the phone has the microUSB port and is slightly thinner.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianLike many other high-end smartphones available now, the Moto X has a 2.5GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor that is powerful enough to deal with anything a user is likely to want to do, including playing graphics-intensive games.Combined with Motorola’s uncluttered Android (more on that later), this means the phone zips along nicely with no lag or stutter anywhere.Battery life is around a day and a half of active use, though this is no longer exceptional when smartphones like Sony’s Xperia Z3 can last a solid two days of heavy use between charges.Most people will not have to worry about charging the Moto X more than once in any 24-hour period, however.SoftwareMotorola has stuck with its characteristic uncluttered Android – the same as the Moto G. The Moto X runs as close to the stock Android experience as Google intended as is possible, rivalling Google’s own Nexus smartphones.Motorola has concentrated on optimising the software to run smoothly throughout. It is about as good as Android 4.4 “KitKat” currently gets. Motorola has promised to upgrade the Moto X to the newly releasedAndroid 5 “Lollipop”as soon as possible and has a good track record of delivering previous software updates within weeks of their release by Google – faster than any other smartphone manufacturer. There’s no indication of how the pending takeover by Lenovo, which is buying Motorola from Google, will affect this.Voice commandsMotorola’s voice recognition feature listens out for an exact phrase, learnt from the user, waking up and allowing a host of voice-control and assistant capabilities.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianThe small additions that Motorola does make to Android are in the form of apps, with the most important app simply called Moto. It uses a built-in natural language coprocessor for advanced voice control of the smartphone, constantly listening out for a customisable hot phrase such as “Hello Moto X” or whatever you want to call your smartphone. Sadly I couldn’t get it to recognise “Oi Jeeves” as it didn’t have the required syllables.Saying the phrase will wake up the phone and gives direct access to Google’s voice search as well as controlling the phone’s functions. Saying “goodnight” will put it into a sleep mode, muting notifications, for instance, while it can send and receive messages, play music and do any number of now-standard voice assistant functions.It works well, even when locked: shouting out the lock code will unlock the phone, no hands required. In practice, though, it will only be something used at home or in the car, as shouting at the phone in the office or while out and about is very awkward.Smart alertsAnother great feature is the on-screen alerts, which show up as small icons on the screen. Holding the icon with a finger shows a quick summary of the alert without unlocking the phone. Moving a hand towards the phone will also also light the notifications, sensing the hand hovering over the top.It’s a very handy feature for quickly checking the time or notifications without fully waking the phone, saving battery life.CameraMotorola’s camera app is super simple – one tap to take a photo, but sometimes it misses the focus.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianMotorola’s own camera app, which comes as the default, is very simple – in my opinion, too simple. It’s fast and easy to use – one tap takes a photo – but invariably it fails to focus correctly. Tap to focus generally works better. There is an option to drag to focus, or users can easily just switch to another camera app, such as Google’s free Camera app.When in focus, the photos have decent detail and colour, but can sometimes be overexposed. Low-light performance is average, but the flash (positioned in a ring around the camera lens) works well. Overall the camera is not as good as some competitors such as the Galaxy S5 or Xperia Z3; it matches top-end smartphones from 2013 rather than 2014’s current crop.PriceThe Moto X undercuts most of the high-end smartphone competition, costing £420 for a basic model with 16GB – others including the Xperia Z3 cost around £50 to £150 more. The 32GB models also costs an extra £40. There’s no option for SD card storage; you’re stuck with the storage you buy.Wood or leather backs cost £20 more.VerdictThe Moto X is a very solid Android smartphone. The slick, uncluttered Android makes it feel like a Google Nexus smartphone, but it is let down by a camera and battery life that aren’t as good as competitors. The lack of an SD card slot is also disappointing, and means even the 32GB version can get cramped with games, photos, videos and music.The build quality is fantastic, and the phone feels really good in the hand, despite its large screen size.It isn’t quite as good value as the £300 Google Nexus 5, but the Moto X certainly bodes well for the Motorola-built Nexus 6, which isdue for release very soon.Pros:uncluttered Android; great voice and gesture control; very solid build; fast processorCons:no SD card; 32GB max storage, average battery life; average camera; quite thickOther reviews•Google Nexus 5 review: a flagship smartphone that costs the same as a mid-range device•Sony Xperia Z3 review: great battery life and quality camera•Samsung Galaxy S5 review: bigger, faster – but still plastic•Samsung Galaxy Alpha review: a direct iPhone 6 competitor•HTC One M8 review: a lightning-quick, five-star phone•LG G3 review: the most usable phablet to date•iPhone 6 review: thinner, faster and slightly cheaper•Nokia Lumia 930 review: the best Windows Phone yet
Driveclub, Sony’s much hyped socially connected driving game and a key PlayStation 4 exclusive, has broken down. Three weeks after it rolled from the showroom and out on to consoles all over the world, the internet functionality is shot, the game’s servers seemingly unable to cope with the numbers of players trying to get online.Developer Evolution Studios has been forced to hold off the release of the planned PlayStation Plus version as well as the companion app, and has repeatedly assured players that the team is working non-stop to solve the issues, preventing them from meeting and playing socially. Yet despite a couple of patches, as well as evidence of behind-the-scenes tinkering, the situation has only improved marginally.At the time of writing the online portion of the game is still not functioning satisfactorily. After no server access for the first 10 days, semi consistent multiplayer races have finally been possible this week, but the process continues to be laborious (just seven races in one hour is our best performance to date) and connection success rate in our experience has only improved to around 50%. When it works, the racing is mostly solid but compromises are evident – there has been no change to the only two types of available racing all week, for instance.Elsewhere, the Challenges element continues to be offline, as are the Face Off segments, player’s stats, ghosts, and the Notifications. Even the Leaderboards aren’t behaving properly.On forums, Facebook, and Twitter, Driveclub players have been expressing their frustration. “So far, Driveclub is no ‘socially connected’ racing game, it’s barely connected at all!” wrote Christian Pohl on the Driveclub Facebook page. “Sorry, after three weeks of ‘We’re fixing it, we’re fixing it’ and no discernible improvements on my end, I’m about done, as fun as the actual driving model is.”Trawl through the comments, filter out the Xbox fanboy vultures predictably feasting on this all-too-perfect ready meal, and you’re still left with hundreds of accounts of similarly disappointing experiences. “I had the game a day or so after launch and the online aspect was not working, you could not connect to the servers at all so this meant you could not join a club or play online,” Andy Hill told the Guardian. “Over the past two weeks it has never worked properly once.”Locked downIn the little communication since the problems began – requests to Evolution or Sony for comment were politely rebuffed, with the developer effectively on lockdown. Evolution has stated that it had no indication of the impending trouble from tests it ran ahead of the game’s release.Indeed, prior to the launch, there were few signs of impending issues. While reviewing the game, the Guardian experienced just four or five occasions when online connectivity was interrupted, with the disruption momentary in all cases – and this was in fact expected as Evolution had communicated it would be playing with the servers while readying the game for release. Besides, so few blips during more than 14 hours of play seemed no cause for alarm, especially with hundreds of players already online.The key issue is that, unlike a game that simply features a subsidiary multiplayer mode, the online connectivity in Driveclub is utterly central to the overall experience. Even in singleplayer, the ability to experience Face Off segments – the mini-challenges based on another player’s speed, powersliding, or cornering line through a particular section – contribute greatly to the vitality of the play experience. There are still thrilling moments to be had in offline singleplayer, but overall the game is comparatively lifeless when cut off from the internet.When you consider the broader scope, the impact is stronger still. The challenges that clubs and individuals can issue each other, for instance, serve as the engine that keeps the momentum of player engagement going. Without them, Driveclub loses much of its drive.Hill agrees. “On one occasion I was doing a time trial and the gods aligned and I had other people’s ghosts to race, in-game challenges to do and it made such a difference to the game; it really highlighted what an empty experience it is without all of these – 99% of the time unfortunately.”The trouble with serversThere have been other high-profile online-related launch failures, of course, but this has only added to the bafflement some players have felt over Driveclub’s situation. “Sim City and Battlefield 4 had disastrous launches, and a year before that, Diablo III,” wrote Pohl. “By now, the established formula for server capacity at launch day should be ‘Whatever you’ve planned, double it and add 20% extra, just to be sure’.”Of course, it’s not really that simple – most developers insist that it’s impossible to fully stress test a server network before a game’s full release. You can throw millions of test bots at the system, but in a real-world launch scenario, with hundreds of different stages in the delivery platform, often including rented server space outside of the direct control of the dev team, there will always be unforeseen bottlenecks and errors. Evolution hasstatedthat it did run “large scale synthetic load tests” and that they worked well. “We had confidence everything was ready,” wrote the game’s director Paul Rustchynsky on Twitter. “These issues were unexpected.”Vitally, there is so much riding on Driveclub’s success. Not only is it the PS4’s first focused driving title, in most respects it has been portrayed as the poster child for the console’s connectivity message. For it to have crashed so spectacularly is a worst-case scenario for Evolution and, particularly, for Sony.Faulty goods?But where does this leave disappointed consumers? Can they get a refund on a game when the online components aren’t working? Unfortunately the situation is ambiguous because consumer law hasn’t kept up with the evolution of video game features or with digital distribution practices.“The Sale of Goods Actshouldapply,” says Alex Tutty at entertainment law specialist Sheridans. “This includes provisions that the good is as described and of satisfactory quality. The multiplayer functionality in Drive Club is arguably one of its core components and so as it is not working correctly may be considered a breach of the Act. If that’s the case the player can choose to reject it – in a reasonable time – and return it and obtain a refund.”However, consumer protection law is made more complicated by software products which contain elements that can be patched at a later date. “If a game does not work as expected but the publisher is then able to remedy that, is there a claim?” says Jas Purewal, an interactive entertainment lawyer at Purewal &amp; Partners. “If the game does not have certain functionality at launch due to factors outside the publisher’s control, is there a claim? If the gamedoeshave everything the publisher promised but sheer demand means the online functionality can’t work fully, is there a claim?“We just don’t know the definitive answers to these questions yet. There are consumer protection rules which could be used, but they were not really designed with these issues in mind and, in any event, every case depends on its facts and circumstances [...] The court or regulator needs to strike a fair balancing act between the two sides.”Driveclub itself will most likely eventually bounce back on to the track fully formed and regain a lot of the momentum it has lost – the experience, when firing on all cylinders, is exhilarating. However, the dent in Sony and Evolution Studios’ reputation will take a lot longer to buff out.Driveclub review – a picturesque race towards truly social gamingDriveClub, PlayStation 4 and the future of social gaming
It’s time for our latest roundup of the latest, greatest Android apps and games, this time from the last two weeks’ worth of releases on the Google Play store.As ever, the prices provided in brackets are for the initial download only: when an app uses in-app purchases, this will be listed as (Free + IAP). Something to look for: a new section of each app’s Google Play store listing, which explains the full range of IAP (for example, “£1.23-£8.01 per item” for Ultralingua Dictionaries from this week’s roundup).More interested in iOS apps? They’re covered in a separate weeklyBest iPhone and iPad Appsroundup, with the latest instalment due to be published later today.APPSHERE for Android Beta (Free)Nokia – the bit that wasn’t bought by Microsoft, obviously – has opened up its HERE maps and navigation to all Android users running a recent version of Google’s software, rather than just Samsung owners. It’s a polished mapping app with offline navigation, public transport info and live traffic – the latter in more than 40 countries so far. The beta is available from Nokia’s site.Inbox by Gmail (Free)This is Google’s new email app, sitting alongside Gmail rather than replacing it. For now, it’s invitation-only – but you can request one – with features aiming to declutter your inbox by grouping similar messages together, from travel details to receipts and promotions. Worth trying, when you get the opportunity.Autodesk SketchBook (Free + IAP)Apple’s iPad has tended to hog the limelight when it comes to artists and illustrators working on tablets, but Android is building up its own library of drawing and painting apps too. Autodesk SketchBook is one of the best yet, with plenty of depth yet an accessible interface for scribblers like me.Skype Qik (Free)In the early days of the app store era, Qik was a video livestreaming app that got plenty of hype. Skype bought it in 2011, then shut it down earlier this year, ahead of a relaunch this month. The app is different now though: more about creating groups then pinging video messages between one another, with the clips automatically deleted after two weeks. It’s fun, but faces a big challenge taking on Snapchat.Lumific - Photo Gallery (Free)Want more features than Android’s default photos app offers? Lumific is one of the apps jostling for attention on the platform and promising to provide them. It’s not for control freaks, since it automatically “beautifies” your photos, including automatically straightening and cropping them. But it could be a time-saver for keen mobile photographers.Snowball Beta (Free)Another beta which – disclosure – I haven’t been able to try yet, either because it’s country-locked or my devices aren’t compatible. But it looks potentially useful: an app that aggregates various social networks and messaging apps into one place: Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Line, Twitter and Hangouts among others now, with Skype and Viber to follow. Worth watching.Clue - Period Tracker (Free)There are quite a few menstrual cycle-tracking apps available now, but Clue looks like one of the easiest to use, with effective design and plenty of features. Its also suitable for various uses: general period tracking, as well as keeping tabs on sex and cervical fluid if you’re trying to get pregnant.Anki Drive (Free)Anki Drive’s big unveiling during Apple’s WWDC keynote in 2013 was a trifle strange, but the product itself is very fun: an app-controlled, thoroughly modern take on Scalextric. It’s now available for Android too, with the same choice of battle and race modes to compete against people on the physical track.Shutter by StreamNation (Free)Finally, more photography, with the schtick here being that all your photos are stored on StreamNation’s servers rather than on your device – although they can be downloaded again to view offline. It supports videos too, with social networks plumbed in for online sharing.Skylanders Trap Team for Android.GAMESSkylanders Trap Team (Free + IAP)You need a recent Android device – a list is provided on the Google Play store – and 2.5GB of free space to install the new Skylanders team, but it’s worth the hassle. This is a proper, full Skylanders game, complete with its own joypad and tablet stand to use with the Skylanders figures. New to the game? It’s a monster-battling fest aimed at children, with new features including the ability to trap beasts then play as them.République (£1.86 + IAP)République is another example of the kind of game proving that tablets can provide deep, satisfying console-style gaming as well as casual fun. Billed as a stealth-action game, it sees you exploring a beautifully-realised world dodging enemies and solving puzzles, working your way through three carefully-plotted episodes – the second and third are the in-app purchases. Brilliant.New Words With Friends (Free + IAP)Scrabble-like digital board game Words With Friends is five years old, making it one of the grizzled veterans of the Google Play store. But this is a brand new, separate version from its publisher Zynga, with better features for finding opponents, more stats on how you’ve played and a dictionary to help find top-scoring words.Lord of the Rings: Legends (Free + IAP)Publisher Kabam’s game based on The Hobbit has been a big hit on smartphones and tablets, so now it’s turning its attention to Lord of the Rings. Based on the films and books, it sees you exploring Tolkien’s universe fighting, questing and falling in with a host of familiar characters. As with past Kabam titles, though, the key will be updates over the coming months (and even years) to add more content.Botanicula (£3.90)One of the most creative, well-crafted games you’ll play on Android this year, Botanicula has charming visuals and sound, wrapped around a plot involving tree-creatures, seeds and parasites. It’s the opposite of twitch gaming: something to relax with on the sofa. And marvellous for it.Galaxy on Fire - Alliances (Free + IAP)The first Galaxy on Fire game was an engrossing space adventure full of flying, fighting and trading. This newer game – just launched globally after being tested in a few countries – is set in the same universe. But it’s more of a massively multiplayer game, as you explore and conquer your way through the galaxy, battling other players.Pixel People (Free + IAP)At first, this seems a bit simple: like a cut-down SimCity where you build a town and add residents, before “splicing” them together to create new professions. But once it sinks its tentacles into you, this is one of the more addictive mobile strategy games in recent memory, with the professions aspect bringing a collect-‘em’all dynamic that you’ll find hard to break.Sentinel 4: Dark Star (£1.99 + IAP)No Android roundup would be complete without at least one tower defence game, and Sentinel 4 is a very good one indeed. Set on an alien planet – no earthbound orcs and wizards here – it sees you defending your base in 26 carefully-constructed maps, with a lot of flexibility for customising your arsenal in response to each level’s intricacies.Retry (Free + IAP)If Flappy Bird was in a plane, he might be Retry. Although that’s selling the new game from Angry Birds publisher Rovio short: it has a number of original touches rather than just cloning this year’s big viral hit. You control a loop-the-looping biplane, making your way through levels – or simply crashing into things. Mostly the latter, in my case.Sentinels of the Multiverse (£7.46)I was new to Sentinels of the Multiverse when this game appeared: the original is a card game that has found a healthy audience for its heroes’n’villains gameplay. Now it’s also available as a tablet game for Android. Existing fans will appreciate it, but it could also be a way in for newcomers to what looks an absorbing game.Champ Man 15 (Free + IAP)Finally, the latest iteration of Square Enix’s football management game, which these days is a freemium title. This year’s version promises a better match engine, faster speed and more Facebook features, hoping to provide more competition for reigning champion Football Manager Handheld.That’s my choice, but what Android apps and games have you been using recently?

David Hasselhoff is busy. It seems like he is always busy. He has just flown into London, ostensibly as part of a promotional tour for his new iPhone game, Hoff Zombie Beach, but he has a lot of other stuff to promote too. In one 15-minute phone conversation, we cover enough ongoing projects to keep any mortal celebrity busy for years. But this is The Hoff. He doesn’t really do mortal.“I just got done a couple of days with Seth McFarlane on Ted 2,” he says breathlessly almost as soon as our call connects. “It’s a really funny bit - we both had a hand in writing it. It’s a very warped sense of humour, but it’s very funny.”His game, it turns out, has its origins three years ago when Sony asked the ex-Knight Rider and Baywatch star to appear in a trailer for the PlayStation title DanceStar Party. They wanted him to create a “Dance Hoff”, showing his best moves for players to copy. “I told them I’m a terrible dancer, but they said, ‘that’s why we chose you’. I did the goofiest dances I could.“The guys who were there, I saw their technology and animation, I said, ‘hey, let’s do a Hoff Around the World game, like Where’s Wally’. So we started developing a game together, and came up with zombies. I mean, we all love zombies. I think I’d just watched Zombieland. So we decided to have zombies invading Venice Beach. And actually if you go to Venice Beach there really are quite a few zombies wandering around that place, trying to figure out which way the sky is, completely out of it.”Hoff Zombie Beach: in which you play as Mitch Buchannon defending Venice Beach against zombiesPhotograph: PR“We’ve got Pamela Anderson as a zombie and a few others you’ll recognise. It’s an easy game, it’s just fun. I’m shooting zombies but they’re not really dead. They come back. My secret weapon is my horrible voice. When I sing really loud, everyone explodes.”One thing you learn very quickly about David Hasslehoff is that he understands his brand. He understands that he is a sort of hyper-real construct, a walking post-modern smorgasbord of ironic memes and pop culture jokes. Every “acting” role he has done, and every cheesy 80s rock ballad he has recorded, is always being telegraphed directly from his ego. Describing the set up of Zombie Beach, he says, “so Mitch Buchannon comes rolling in and gets out of the Knight Rider car... we have no shame, we’ll use whatever we can.”I ask if he plays video games. “I used to,” he says. “I played Centipede, Space Invaders, Asteroids … My girlfriend is constantly on that memory game, Dots. I’m too busy working, buddy. I was sitting next to another celebrity on the plane over and he was playing solitaire for hours. I thought, I don’t want to do that, I want to starting working on my next movie!“I’m at a point right now where I have some new music coming out, I have two movies including Killing Hasselhoff, which I produced - it’s a comedy about a celebrity death pool; one guy decides to chase me. He hires a hitman who happens to be in love with David Hasselhoff. We’re just going to do whatever comes along.”And something else that’s come along is 3D printing. This month, David Hasselhoff the businessman announced that he was investing in a new concept from start-up Things3D – a sort of 3D-celebrity-selfie generator. “You go into a booth, it scans you and you can walk out with a Hoff figure or Pamela Anderson or any celebrity you want,” he explains.“We’re just beginning the licensing process, but it’s going to be huge. I mean, I can see these things at football games - you could have a doll of yourself holding the trophy with your favourite star. We’re just closing the patent on that. It’s amazing. And it takes just a second to scan you. I went in to the booth with a Baywatch jacket on and did a cheesy pose – I had to go cheesy of course.”He obviously then tweeted the resulting figure to his adoring fanbase:Watch this space for the next big project I&#39;m working on. 3D printing with a completely unique twist!#smartselfiepic.twitter.com/dnDDakIhwN&mdash; David Hasselhoff (@DavidHasselhoff)October 15, 2014Similarly to the Skylanders and Disney Infinity figures, the Smartselfies as they’re known, will contain a chip allowing owners to transfer data on to them. Perhaps you could create a doll of you embracing a favourite popstar, then upload their song into the figure, before sending it to a friend. Or maybe it could interact with a dedicated smartphone or tablet app. the details are vague. David Hasselhoff doesn’t reallydodetails.Hoff and historyThere’s one other thing he’s promoting: Hasselhoff Vs. The Berlin Wall, which despite the name, is not another video game. Screening on the National Geographic channel, it is of course a documentary which sees the star returning to the city where, 25 years ago, he performed his song Looking for Freedom as the wall fell. He wore a jacket with lights on it. If you saw it, you’ll remember – possibly despite strenuous efforts to forget.“It’s was a really surreal time,” he says. “My song was number one for eight weeks over the summer, and for that New Year’s Eve, they called me and asked if I’d sing it on a big television show - I said, ‘yeah, only if I can sing it on the wall’. I was joking, I would have gone anyway, but they said okay. It was the most incredible moment. It was people celebrating freedom, families who hadn’t seen each other for years.In the documentary, Hasslehoff visits the tunnels dug under the wall and meets people who successfully escaped to the West of the city. “I met two men who ziplinned across the wall, then flipped the bird at the guards,” he says. “I also met three brothers who flew over in ultralights – they showed me where they landed. They offered to fly me over in the in the original ultralights, but I said no, I think I’ll pass on that.”Finally then, we have found the thing that David Hasselhoff will not do in the name of entertainment. He will make video games, he will resurrect his singing career, he will produce films in which he is an assassination target, he will make small 3D printed versions of himself. But he absolutely will not fly over Berlin in a historical re-enactment. Although, if they’d have customised the ultralight to look like the Knight Rider car, he’d have been up there in a flash.Hoff Zombie Beach is available to download now on theApp Store.Hasselhoff Vs. The Berlin Wall airs Tuesday 4 November 9pm on National Geographic Channel.
