My weekend gaming - like so many in the last month - was dominated by download games on the consoles. The latest treat - following on from Limbo and Deathspank - is Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. Yes, it lacks the sense of wonder engendered by some of the earlier games in the Tomb Raider series but Guardian of Light is a successful reinvention. Online multiplayer is delayed until September though so it may be worth waiting till then - the game is released on Weds - if you are still ploughing through other stuff.  Anyway, how was your gaming weekend?

Monday's edition of Chatterbox
Every 50 years or so, American magazine theAtlanticlobs an intellectual grenade into our culture. In the summer of 1945, for example, it published an essay by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) engineer Vannevar Bush entitled "As We May Think". It turned out to be the blueprint for what eventually emerged as the world wide web. Two summers ago, theAtlanticpublished an essay byNicholas Carr,one of the blogosphere's most prominent (and thoughtful) contrarians, under the headline "Is Google Making Us Stupid?"."Over the past few years," Carr wrote, "I've had an uncomfortable sense that someone, or something, has been tinkering with my brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory. My mind isn't going – so far as I can tell – but it's changing. I'm not thinking the way I used to think. I can feel it most strongly when I'm reading. Immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy. My mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument and I'd spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose. That's rarely the case anymore. Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages. I get fidgety, lose the thread, begin looking for something else to do. I feel as if I'm always dragging my wayward brain back to the text. The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle."The title of the essay is misleading, because Carr's target was not really the world's leading search engine, but the impact that ubiquitous, always-on networking is having on our cognitive processes. His argument was that our deepening dependence on networking technology is indeed changing not only the way we think, but also the structure of our brains.Carr's article touched a nerve and has provoked a lively, ongoing debate on the net and in print (he has now expanded it into a book,The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains). This is partly because he's an engaging writer who has vividly articulated the unease that many adults feel about the way their modi operandi have changed in response to ubiquitous networking. Who bothers to write down or memorise detailed information any more, for example, when they know that Google will always retrieve it if it's needed again? The web has become, in a way, a global prosthesis for our collective memory.It's easy to dismiss Carr's concern as just the latest episode of the moral panic that always accompanies the arrival of a new communications technology. People fretted about printing, photography, the telephone and television in analogous ways. It even bothered Plato, who argued that the technology of writing would destroy the art of remembering.But just because fears recur doesn't mean that they aren't valid. There's no doubt that communications technologies shape and reshape society – just look at the impact that printing and the broadcast media have had on our world. The question that we couldn't answer before now was whether these technologies could also reshape us. Carr argues that modern neuroscience, which has revealed the "plasticity" of the human brain, shows that our habitual practices can actually change our neuronal structures. The brains of illiterate people, for example, are structurally different from those of people who can read. So if the technology of printing – and its concomitant requirement to learn to read – could shape human brains, then surely it's logical to assume that our addiction to networking technology will do something similar?Not all neuroscientists agree with Carr and some psychologists are sceptical. Harvard'sSteven Pinker, for example, is openly dismissive. But many commentators who accept the thrust of his argument seem not only untroubled by its far-reaching implications but are positively enthusiastic about them. When the Pew Research Centre's Internet &amp; American Life project asked its panel of more than 370 internet experts for their reaction, 81% of them agreed with the proposition that "people's use of the internet has enhanced human intelligence".Others argue that the increasing complexity of our environment means that we need the net as "power steering for the mind". We may be losing some of the capacity for contemplative concentration that was fostered by a print culture, they say, but we're gaining new and essential ways of working. "The trouble isn't that we have too much information at our fingertips," says the futurologist Jamais Cascio, "but that our tools for managing it are still in their infancy. Worries about 'information overload' predate the rise of the web... and many of the technologies that Carr worries about were developed precisely to help us get some control over a flood of data and ideas. Google isn't the problem – it's the beginning of a solution."Sarah Churchwell, academic and criticIs the internet changing our brains? It seems unlikely to me, but I'll leave that question to evolutionary biologists. As a writer, thinker, researcher and teacher, what I can attest to is that the internet is changing our habits of thinking, which isn't the same thing as changing our brains. The brain is like any other muscle – if you don't stretch it, it gets both stiff and flabby. But if you exercise it regularly, and cross-train, your brain will be flexible, quick, strong and versatile.In one sense, the internet is analogous to a weight-training machine for the brain, as compared with the free weights provided by libraries and books. Each method has its advantage, but used properly one works you harder. Weight machines are directive and enabling: they encourage you to think you've worked hard without necessarily challenging yourself. The internet can be the same: it often tells us what we think we know, spreading misinformation and nonsense while it's at it. It can substitute surface for depth, imitation for originality, and its passion for recycling would surpass the most committed environmentalist.In 10 years, I've seen students' thinking habits change dramatically: if information is not immediately available via a Google search, students are often stymied. But of course what a Google search provides is not the best, wisest or most accurate answer, but the most popular one.But knowledge is not the same thing as information, and there is no question to my mind that the access to raw information provided by the internet is unparalleled and democratising. Admittance to elite private university libraries and archives is no longer required, as they increasingly digitise their archives. We've all read the jeremiads that the internet sounds the death knell of reading, but people read online constantly – we just call it surfing now. What they are reading is changing, often for the worse; but it is also true that the internet increasingly provides a treasure trove of rare books, documents and images, and as long as we have free access to it, then the internet can certainly be a force for education and wisdom, and not just for lies, damned lies, and false&nbsp;statistics.In the end, the medium is not the message, and the internet is just a medium, a repository and an archive. Its greatest virtue is also its greatest weakness: it is unselective. This means that it is undiscriminating, in both senses of the word. It is indiscriminate in its principles of inclusion: anything at all can get into it. But it also – at least so far – doesn't discriminate against anyone with access to it. This is changing rapidly, of course, as corporations and governments seek to exert control over it. Knowledge may not be the same thing as power, but it is unquestionably a means to power. The question is, will we use the internet's power for good, or for evil? The jury is very much out. The internet itself is disinterested: but what we use it for is&nbsp;not.Sarah Churchwell is a senior lecturer in American literature and culture at the University of East&nbsp;AngliaNaomi Alderman, novelistIf I were a cow, nothing much would change my brain. I might learn new locations for feeding, but I wouldn't be able to read an essay and decide to change the way I lived my life. But I'm not a cow, I'm a person, and therefore pretty much everything I come into contact with can change my brain.It's both a strength and a weakness. We can choose to seek out brilliant thinking and be challenged and inspired by it. Or we can find our energy sapped by an evening with a "poor me" friend, or become faintly disgusted by our own thinking if we've read too many romance novels in one go. As our bodies are shaped by the food we eat, our brains are shaped by what we put into them.So of course the internet is changing our brains. How could it not? It's not surprising that we're now more accustomed to reading short-form pieces, to accepting a Wikipedia summary, rather than reading a whole book. The claim that we're now thinking less well is much more suspect. If we've lost something by not reading 10&nbsp;books on one subject, we've probably&nbsp;gained as much by being able to link together ideas easily from 10 different disciplines.But since we're not going to dismantle the world wide web any time soon, the more important question is: how should we respond? I suspect the answer is as simple as making time for reading. No single medium will ever give our brains all possible forms of nourishment. We may be dazzled by the flashing lights of the web, but we can still just step away. Read a book. Sink into the world of a single person's concentrated thoughts.Time was when we didn't need to be reminded to read. Well, time was when we didn't need to be encouraged to cook. That time's gone. None the less, cook. And read. We can decide to change our own brains – that's the most astonishing thing of all.Ed Bullmore, psychiatristWhether or not the internet has made a difference to how we use our brains, it has certainly begun to make a difference to how we think about our brains. The internet is a vast and complex network of interconnected computers, hosting an equally complex network – the web – of images, documents and data. The rapid growth of this huge, manmade, information-processing system has been a major factor stimulating scientists to take a fresh look at the organisation of biological information-processing systems like the brain.It turns out that the human brain and the internet have quite a lot in common. They are both highly non-random networks with a "small world" architecture, meaning that there is both dense clustering of connections between neighbouring nodes and enough long-range short cuts to facilitate communication between distant nodes. Both the internet and the brain have a wiring diagram dominated by a relatively few, very highly connected nodes or hubs; and both can be subdivided into a number of functionally specialised families or modules of nodes. It may seem remarkable, given the obvious differences between the internet and the brain in many ways, that they should share so many high-level design features. Why should this be?One possibility is that the brain and the internet have evolved to satisfy the same general fitness criteria. They may both have been selected for high efficiency of information transfer, economical wiring cost, rapid adaptivity or evolvability of function and robustness to physical damage.Networks that grow or evolve to satisfy some or all of these conditions tend to end up looking the same.Although there is much still to understand about the brain, the impact&nbsp;of the internet has helped us to learn new ways of measuring its organisation as a network. It has also begun to show us that the human brain&nbsp;probably does not represent some unique pinnacle of complexity but may have more in common than we might have guessed with many other information-processing networks.Ed Bullmore is professor of psychiatry at the University of CambridgeGeoff Dyer, writerSometimes I think my ability to concentrate is being nibbled away by the internet; other times I think it's being gulped down in huge, Jaws-shaped chunks. In those quaint days before the internet, once you made it to your desk there wasn't much to distract you. You could sit there working or you could just sit there. Now you sit down and there's a universe of possibilities – many of them obscurely relevant to the work you should be getting on with – to tempt you. To think that I can be sitting here, trying to write something about Ingmar Bergman and, a moment later, on the merest whim, can be watching a clip from a Swedish documentary about Don Cherry – that is a miracle (albeit one with a very potent side-effect, namely that it's unlikely I'll ever have the patience to sit through an entire Bergman film again).Then there's the outsourcing of memory. From the age of 16, I got into the habit of memorising passages of poetry and compiling detailed indexes in the backs of books of prose. So if there was a passage I couldn't remember, I would spend hours going through my books, seeking it out. Now, in what TS Eliot, with great prescience, called "this twittering world", I just google the key phrase of the half-remembered quote. Which is great, but it's drained some of the purpose from my life.Exactly the same thing has happened now that it's possible to get hold of out-of-print books instantly on the web. That's great too. But one of the side incentives to travel was the hope that, in a bookstore in Oregon, I might finally track down a book I'd been wanting for years. All of&nbsp;this searching and tracking down was immensely time-consuming – but&nbsp;only in the way that being alive is time-consuming.Colin Blakemore, neurobiologistIt's curious that some of the most vociferous critics of the internet – those who predict that it will produce generations of couch potatoes, with minds of mush – are the very sorts of people who are benefiting most from this wonderful, liberating, organic extension of the human mind. They are academics, scientists, scholars and writers, who fear that the extraordinary technology that they use every day is a danger to the unsophisticated.They underestimate the capacity of the human mind – or rather the brain that makes the mind – to capture and capitalise on new ways of storing and transmitting information. When I was at school I learned by heart great swathes of poetry and chunks of the Bible, not to mention page after page of science textbooks. And I spent years at a desk learning how to do long division in pounds, shillings and pence. What a waste of my neurons, all clogged up with knowledge and rules that I can now obtain with the click of a mouse.I have little doubt that the printing press changed the way that humans used their memories. It must have put out of business thousands of masters of oral history and storytelling. But our brains are so remarkably adept at putting unused neurons and virgin synaptic connections to other uses. The basic genetic make-up of Homo sapiens has been essentially unchanged for a quarter of a million years. Yet 5,000 years ago humans discovered how to write and read; 3,000 years ago they discovered logic; 500 years ago, science. These revolutionary advances in the capacity of the human mind occurred without genetic change. They were products of the "plastic" potential of human brains to learn from their experience and reinvent themselves.At its best, the internet is no threat to our minds. It is another liberating extension of them, as significant as books, the abacus, the pocket calculator or the Sinclair Z80.Just as each of those leaps of technology could be (and were) put to bad use, we should be concerned about the potentially addictive, corrupting and radicalising influence of the internet. But let's not burn our PCs or stomp on our iPads. Let's not throw away the liberating baby with the bathwater of censorship.Colin Blakemore is professor of neuroscience at the University of OxfordIan Goodyer, psychiatristThe key contextual point here is that the brain is a social organ and is responsive to the environment. All environments are processed by the brain, whether it's the internet or the weather – it doesn't matter. Do these environments change the brain? Well, they could and probably do in evolutionary time.The internet is just one of a whole range of characteristics that could change the brain and it would do so by altering the speed of learning. But the evidence that the internet has a deleterious effect on the brain is zero. In fact, by looking at the way human beings learn in general, you would probably argue the opposite. If anything, the opportunity to have multiple sources of information provides a very efficient way of learning and certainly as successful as learning through other means.It is being argued that the information coming into the brain from the internet is the wrong kind of information. It's too short, it doesn't have enough depth, so there is a qualitative loss. It's an interesting point, but the only way you could argue it is to say that people are misusing the internet. It's a bit like saying to someone who's never seen a car before and has no idea what it is: "Why don't you take it for a drive and you'll find out?" If you seek information on the internet like that, there's a good chance you'll have a crash. But that's because your experience has yet to inculcate what a car is. I don't think you can argue that those latent processes are going to produce brain pathology.I think the internet is a fantastic tool and one of the great wonders of the world, if not the greatest. Homo&nbsp;sapiens must just learn to use it&nbsp;properly.Ian Goodyer is professor of psychiatry at the University of CambridgeMaryanne Wolf, cognitive neuroscientistI am an apologist for the reading brain. It represents a miracle that springs from the brain's unique capacity to rearrange itself to learn something new. No one, however, knows what this reading brain will look like in one more generation.No one today fully knows what is happening in the brains of children as they learn to read while immersed in digitally dominated mediums a minimum of six to seven hours a day (Kaiser report, 2010). The present reading brain's circuitry is a masterpiece of connections linking the most basic perceptual areas to the most complex linguistic and cognitive functions, like critical analysis, inference and novel thought (ie, "deep reading processes"). But this brain is only one variation of the many that are possible. Therein lies the cerebral beauty and the cerebral rub of plasticity.Understanding the design principles of the plastic reading brain highlights the dilemma we face with our children. It begins with the simple fact that we human beings were never born to read. Depending on several factors, the brain rearranges critical areas in vision, language and cognition in order to read. Which circuit parts are used depends on factors like the writing system (eg English v Chinese); the formation (eg how well the child is taught); and the medium (eg a sign, a book, the internet). For example, the Chinese reading brain requires more cortical areas involved in visual memory than the English reader because of the thousands of characters. In its formation, the circuit utilises fairly basic processes to decode and, with time and cognitive effort, learns to incorporate "deep reading processes" into the expert reading circuit.The problem is that because there is no single reading brain template, the present reading brain never needs to develop. With far less effort, the reading brain can be "short-circuited" in its formation with little time and attention (either in milliseconds or years) to the deep reading processes that contribute to the individual reader's cognitive development.The problem of a less potentiated reading brain becomes more urgent in the discussion about technology. The characteristics of each reading medium reinforce the use of some cognitive components and potentially reduce reliance on others. Whatever any medium favours (eg, slow, deep reading v rapid information-gathering) will influence how the reader's circuit develops over time. In essence, we human beings are not just the product of what we read, but how we read.For me, the essential question has become: how well will we preserve the critical capacities of the present expert reading brain as we move to the digital reading brain of the next generation? Will the youngest members of our species develop their capacities for the deepest forms of thought while reading or will they become a culture of very different readers – with some children so inured to a surfeit of information that they have neither the time nor the motivation to go beyond superficial decoding? In our rapid transition into a digital culture, we need to figure out how to provide a full repertoire of cognitive skills that can be used across every medium by our children and, indeed, by ourselves.Maryanne Wolf is the author of Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain, Icon Books, 2008Bidisha, writer and criticThe internet is definitely affecting the way I think, for the worse. I fantasise about an entire month away from it, with no news headlines, email inboxes, idle googling or instant messages, the same way retirees contemplate a month in the Bahamas. The internet means that we can never get away from ourselves, our temptations and obsessions. There's something depressing about knowing I can literally and metaphorically log on to the same homepage, wherever I am in the world.My internet use and corresponding brain activity follow a distinct pattern of efficiency. There's the early morning log-on, the quick and accurate scan of the day's news, the brisk queries and scheduling, the exchange of scripts of articles or edited book extracts.After all this good stuff, there's what I call the comet trail: the subsequent hours-long, bitty, unsatisfying sessions of utter timewasting. I find myself looking up absolute nonsense only tangentially related to my work, fuelled by obsessions and whims and characterised by topic-hopping, bad spelling, squinting, forum lurking and comically wide-ranging search terms. I end having created nothing myself, feeling isolated, twitchy and unable to sleep, with a headache and painful eyes, not having left the house once.The internet enables you look up anything you want and get it slightly wrong. It's like a never-ending, trashy magazine sucking all time, space and logic into its bottomless maw. And, like all trashy magazines, it has its own tone, slang and lexicon. I was tempted to construct this piece in textspeak, Tweet abbreviations or increasingly abusive one-liners to demonstrate the level of wit the internet has facilitated – one that is frighteningly easily to mimic and perpetuate. What we need to counteract the slipshod syntax, off-putting abusiveness, unruly topic-roaming and frenetic, unreal "social networking" is good, old-fashioned discipline. We are the species with the genius to create something as wondrous as the internet in the first place. Surely we have enough self-control to stay away from Facebook.• This articles was amended on 27 August 2010 to change "quarter of a billion years" to "quarter of a million years".
Released recently with little fanfare,Risk: Factionsdoes a splendidly emphatic job of answering the perfectly reasonable "why?" of board-to-video-game conversions. First, through the simple: offering an AI or online opponent, eliminating half the battle – that of finding someone to play with. Then there's the nostalgia. Packaged within this download is "classic" Risk – Irkutsk! Kamchatka! – the gang's all here and playable without having to search for dice, cards or a sturdy table. Brilliant.Finally, through updating and breathing new life into an established brand. WhichFactionsdoes in spades. There are new maps, special weapons, dynamic scenery (will the volcano explode or not – wait until the end of your turn to find out!) and a spiffy 50s cartoon-style animation – all held together by the simple turn-based die-rolling mechanic. And, of course, there are the factions – play as humans, robots, cats, yetis or even zombies. The latter, rather cutely, seem to be looking for somewhere "to live", their presence in a game like this indicative of how these Lebensraum-seeking undead have moved on since making censors nervous in the 70s. Fans of the original game, or its modern counterparts like Advance Wars, will love this chance to roll with it.
What better way to celebrate an action movie starring everyone from back in the day than an old-school run-and-gun side-scroller? The grizzled action stars are none other than Sly, Arnie, Dolph et al, and the game, for those who can recall 1987, is barely distinguishable from the Konami classicGryzor(akaContrato our American friends).The Expendables8-Bit game wears its lo-fi origins proudly like a bit-mapped Purple Heart on its sleeve, and presents three levels of familiar and thoroughly enjoyable gameplay. A catchy retro soundtrack bleeps you on through waves of South American soldiery in the jungle level, into the evil dictator's fortress, and up against the general himself. As befits a game that looks like you're playing it on a ZX Spectrum, it is great fun and completely unforgiving. If you touch any enemy or missile, you lose a life. That's how it used to be: no quarter. It's relatively simple to complete as the super-springy Jet Li, and Jason Statham's triple throwing knife power-up makes short work of the forces of oppression. To finish it as the barely mobile Sly, however, will take some old-school skill. No money, however. This party is free.
Price£12,995MPG57.6CO2 per km129 gramsIt's one of the trickiest and potentially more embarrassing manoeuvres a driver has to perform – the roadside loo break. Crouching in the lee of an open door, the wind of passing traffic whistling between your bare thighs, the silent prayer a car travelling in the same direction won't suddenly appear and leave you hopelessly exposed… Well, worry no more. The new Meriva, a stylish small family car from Vauxhall, features rear-hinged back doors which mean when you open back and front together you create  a small pocket of privacy. The relief!Much as I'd like to believe these back-to-front doors were created as the ultimate mobile comfort stop, they were designed to make access and egress to the back of the car as undemanding as possible. NHS statistics on back pain make for grim reading. Half of us will have lower-back pain this year (you may, in fact, be reading this while lying on a hard floor – in which case, I hope it passes soon); and our dodgy backs account for more sick days than  anything other than, well, dodgy prawns.Working with chiropractors,  physiotherapists and design experts, Vauxhall has managed to reduce twisting and loading on the lower back by up to 58%. They have done this by creating taller doors which open wider so you don't have to bend over as much to get in. To make that more technical: the Meriva's rear-hinged door opens to  84 degrees – 17 degrees more than  a traditional door. A grab handle on the inside of the central B-pillar also makes it easier to haul yourself out, something older passengers will  appreciate. The RAC estimates that in the next 20 years there will be twice as many male drivers over 70 and three times as many female drivers over 70  – that's a whole lot of back pain.The sexier name for "rear-hinged back doors" is suicide doors. So named because if the door becomes unlatched at speed, the wind will snap it open. On a conventional front-hinged door, the wind forces the door shut. The Rolls- Royce Phantom and London black cab – and now the Meriva – have got round this safety problem by having  a special lock that prevents the door from being opened unless the car is at a standstill. The only other cars with rear-opening back doors are currently Mazda's RX-8 and the Mini Clubman. But they have front doors which overlap the back doors so they're not strictly speaking suicide doors, they're clamshell doors.The old Meriva was the best seller  in its class for seven years, so this new incarnation has a lot riding on it. It's  wider and  longer than the outgoing model, but a great deal funkier. Clever cut lines around the front spotlights and below the grille give the face an  expressive appeal and the wave in the window line and the stepped door panels give it a slightly zany, sculptural look.Inside, the car follows in the soft-soled footsteps of Vauxhall's reworked Astra and its new Insignia – it feels comfortable, contemporary and  unexpectedly swanky. The car is also  a compulsive hoarder's dream. It has 32 separate storage cubbies, including a removable central console – Vauxhall came up with a list of 100 items that the typical Meriva owner would want to fit into these spaces. Engine wise, I drove the economical turbocharged diesel variant which was lively and responsive.The Meriva won't win awards for smoothness or the quietness of the engine, but this is a model determined to take some of the back (and bladder) pain out of family driving.Talking dirty: white van slogansCar sales have been in the doldrums recently, but vans have been a different story. The past year has seen purchases increase by almost 130%. So, plenty of fresh canvas for our streetwise and hilarious "dirt sloganeers"  to display their wit on. Here's  a list of some of our favourites, compiled by the insurance specialists Hastings Direct. Why not see how many you can spot on the road?

Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360Psychotic anti-heroes Kane and Lynch are stuck in Shanghai, a world of dilapidated architecture, glaring neon and lethally armed hoodlums. The plot, something about gang bosses and deals gone bad, whizzes past in its irrelevance while you're assailed by gangsters, policemen, attack dogs, soldiers and helicopter gunships on your way to final escape. Its mockumentary, shakycam presentation is startlingly convincing, an effect that's enhanced by judicious blurring of nudity and more obscene moments of gore. With no boss fights or much to do beyond shooting and seeking cover - save for a brief spell firing from a helicopter - the game is sustained by its raucous staging and the breathless, chaotic feel of its engagements that take you with freight train-like momentum to its finale, where the action just sort of peters out. But with well-thought-through multiplayer mechanics, this is dramatically more fun than its unpleasantly sleazy predecessor.Eidos, £44.95Piczle Lines, iPhone, iPod TouchHelping a mad scientist recover his data-corrupted holiday snaps is the unusual story glued onto this Japanese puzzle game that plays like a mixture of Sudoku, Mine Sweeper and Picross.

You draw a line between each pair that is the same length in squares as the numbers you're connecting, so each brace of threes gets connected with a line three squares long, for example. Like sudoku, hearing the rules in isolation makes it sound like a painful, near-educational drudge, whereas in reality, it's extremely hard to put down once you get into the swing. Coming with 20 completely free stages, another 120 will set you back a very reasonable 59p. A combination of the iPhone's diminutive screen and Piczle Lines' tightly-drawn grids will make your fingers feel ogre-sized, but, with no time limit, you can rectify gaffs at your leisure.Score Studios, freeHighborn HD, iPadHighborn HD is a turn-based strategy game, relying wholly on tactics and mild cunning rather than those old gaming favourites, reflexes and dexterity. Capture towns to supply you with more troops, and monasteries to acquire healing monks, then take on the baddies in a series of eight missions, brought to life by neat graphics and an amusing script with characters unafraid to mock hackneyed game play and plot devices as they crop up. It keeps the atmosphere light and is an excellent counterpoint to fights that can take well over half an hour to complete, although being able to save at any time prevents that becoming an inconvenience. With a cumbersome interface that won't let you undo actions and unhurried battle animations that can't be turned off, it's not without its flaws, but at £1.79 for five hours' worth of entertainment it would be churlish to complain.Jet Set Games, £1.79
That Daily Mirror report todaythat the Apple TV is to be relaunched with the name "iTV"? Hogwash, apparently.The Mirror's improbable statement from "an Apple spokeswoman" – that the names will be too similar – is pretty much tripe, we've heard, and has been removed.Before:After:What's more, deep down in a2007 press releaseabout iTunes 7 and the then-upcoming "iTV Player", Apple delivers the immortal line (my emphasis):iTV is the project's internal code name andwill notbe the final product name.Of course, Apple could change its mind and decide iTV is a canny little name after all. But it's unlikely. (Files under:Skype vs. Sky)An Apple spokesman told the Guardian: "Apple does not comment on rumours and speculation."An ITV spokesperson toldThe Next Web: "ITV is an extremely strong brand and a household name in the UK, established more than 50 years ago. We highly value our intellectual property rights and hold a large number of registered trade marks for both the ITV name and our logos."
BlackBerry manufacturer Research in Motion is "optimistic" the company can resolve security demands from the Indian government regarding its popular smartphone.According to Reuters, RIM vice president Robert Crow said the Canadian firm's negotiations with Indian officials are "a step in a long journey".India yesterday issued a deadline of less than three weeks for RIM to resolve  concerns over the security of its BlackBerry device, warning that the phone's email and messenging service would be shut down by 31 August if no settlement is reached."Our message to RIM and service providers is that if they don't come up with a technical solution by 31 August, then the home ministry will take a view and will shut down BlackBerry Messenger and business enterprises services," a spokesman for the ministry said.Indian officials have been meeting to discuss the future of telecommunications companies in the country, starting with the BlackBerry manufacturer. Similar concernsappear set to beaddressed with search giant Google and internet telephony firm Skype at a later date.A senior Indian security official, who wished to remain anonymous, told Reuters: "Wherever there is a concern on grounds of national security the government will want access and every country has a right to lawful interference."We have concerns regarding [Google and Skype] services on grounds of national security and all those services which cannot be put to lawful interference."In a public statement addressed to its approximately 800,000 BlackBerry customers in the country, RIM said that the company "genuinely tries to be as cooperative as possible with governments in the spirit of supporting legal and national security requirements, while also preserving the lawful needs of citizens and corporations".RIM said that any negotiations over access to data would be "limited by four main principles": that it was legal, that there would be "no greater access" to BlackBerry services than other services, that there would be no changes in the security for Enterprise customers, and it would not make "special deals for specific countries".Nick Jones, a senior analyst at Gartner, said there is uncertainty over whether India is objecting to the use of BlackBerry Enterprise Servers in the country, which afford companies and organisations a higher level of security than for individual customers.Jones said it would be "exceedingly bad" for the Canadian manufacturer's reputation if it was to change its security architecture to support requests from a government seeking to monitor customer information.Further, BlackBerry messaging is not subject to the same encryption process as email on the device, and so "may be less secure and more open to lawful interception"."I believe that governments are being very naive about this," Jones said. "If RIM is perceived as insecure, criminals and terrorists will just switch to more secure communication tools the government can't intercept. There is a wide choice."Being able to read RIM traffic is likely only to catch technically unsophisticated criminals who are probably not the big risk in any case."
Fears that Google's Street View camera car had captured an image of its first corpse have been allayed after the apparently lifeless child was found to be alive and well.Residents of Middle Road, Worcester, had a nasty surprise when usingGoogle's mapping service– after it showedthe body of a young girl sprawled on the pavement.Yesterday, however, the child was located and named, having reportedly been playing a prank with a friend which Google inadvertently captured.Azura Beebeejaun, aged 10,told Worcester Newsthat she had no idea she had been snapped, and may have fallen over as the car went past.The paperhad received calls from readersconcerned for the welfare of the girl, whose photograph was taken by the web giant last year. An investigation soon revealed the identity and whereabouts of Beebeejaun, and more importantly that she had not collapsed on the pavement.A spokeswoman for Google said anyone who was unhappy with an image shown on street view could ask for it to be removed or blurred, however at the time of writing the picture remains."The imagery in Street View represents a snapshot in time of Britain's streets and is no different to what anyone might expect to see for themselves around the country," said the spokeswoman."Sometimes that means our cars inadvertently capture odd or inappropriate moments as they drive past."Among the odder moments has been the repeat appearance of "horse boy" in Scotland – a being whichappears to have the body of a man but the head of a horse.No explanation has been given regarding the origins of the beast, whose image has beencaptured twice in Aberdeen, although some have suggested it may be a man wearing a rubber horse mask.Google street view also attracted attention last year, when it emerged one of its camera cars had struck a baby deer in upstate New York,capturing the fawn's image and uploading it to the mapping site.
Software company Oracle has filed a lawsuit against Google, accusing the search giant of patent infringement with the Android mobile operating system.The legal complaint, filed in California, concerns Oracle's Java software, which it acquired throughthe purchase of Sun Microsystemsearlier this year.In a press statement, Oracle spokeswoman Karen Tillman said: "In developing Android, Google knowingly, directly and repeatedly infringed Oracle's Java-related intellectual property."This lawsuit seeks appropriate remedies for their infringement."A Google spokesman said he could not comment on the lawsuit as the company had not had a chance to review it yet.Google's Android platform has enjoyed a rapid ascent in the smartphone market due to the multiplicity of devices now running it.Figures released yesterday by analyst Gartnershow Android is now the leading smartphone platform in the US, overtaking BlackBerry manufacturer Research in Motion.In the months leading up to Android's release, industry insidersspeculatedabout its possible effect on the Java programming language.Now Oracle is said to be seeking an injunction to stop Google from further building and distributing Android, plus higher monetary damages for willful and deliberate infringement.Part of Oracle's complaint focuses on a piece of software included within the Android operating system called Dalvik. It is a virtual machine which is used to run some applications on Android devices.Malik Saadi-Kamal, principal analyst at Informa Telecoms &; Media, told the Guardian: "This is similar to when Microsoft was mandating the integration of Internet Explorer as a default browser, which raised some concerns among competitors."But the problem I can see coming is the fact that Google is mandating the use of Dalvik as the main java runtime for Android and device vendors can't really substitute this runtime against another Java Runtime complying with Java Me or not."Writing on thecompany blog, Brian Prentice, a research vice president at analyst Gartner, said Oracle is "not a company that has made a sport" out of actions like this:"[...] before we write off Oracle's action against Google as another attempt to obtain a tidy little license agreement, let's realise that we could be dealing with an IP pit bull here."If Oracle sees Android as being as much a strategic threat to their business as TomorrowNow was, then this has a higher probability of making its way to the courts than your average infringement action. If it does, and if they prevail, then look out Google."Ben Wood, director of research atCCS Insight, told the Guardian: "Given that over one billion mobile phones are sold every year, even a few pennies per mobile phone can add up to a big revenue. On this basis it is unsurprising that Google's Android has emerged as a target for intellectual property claims."Google is likely having discussions with lots of patent owners on this topic and given Java's long history in mobile phone application development Oracle may feel that it has grounds to claim infringements."

We have now entered the games industry's own silly season – the time of the year in which hardly anyone bothers releasing games, because they invariably sell badly since swathes of the population are away on holiday (although one suspects that trend might not be quite as emphatic as usual in these credit-crunched times).But this year, games have enjoyed relief from the seasonal drought of boxed titles, thanks to an unusually high-quality bunch of download games available via the Xbox Live arcade and PlayStation Network. As the lack of the words Tomb and Raider in the title indicate, Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is such a download game – an amuse-bouche to keep Lara fans pacified while Crystal Dynamics takes its time beavering away at the next full-blown release in the Tomb Raider franchise.Guardian of Light's anomalous nature is emphasised the moment you boot it up: it eschews the tight third-person viewpoint in favour of an isometric one, with the camera zoomed out and above the action. While this may annoy Nuts and Zoo readers – Lara's perfectly-proportioned rear no longer fills the centre of the screen – it should please gamers, as it goes a long way towards eliminating Tomb Raider's most persistent problem, namely an unhelpful and unpredictable camera. It also makes the shooting element of the game much more precise and satisfying.Behind the isometric facade, Guardian of Light clings pretty conventionally to the Tomb Raider blueprint, mixing shooting and boss-battles with a modicum of leaping around (although that takes more of a background seat with the new camera viewpoint) and plenty of puzzle-solving. Plot-wise, it's familiar stuff: Lara is on the trail of an artefact called the Mirror of Smoke, but it falls into the hands of the mercenary Vasco, who unleashes Xolotl, the demon which it imprisoned, who then goes on the rampage.Luckily, the mirror's guardian, Totec, is on hand to give Lara a helping hand. At least, when you play the game in two-player co-op mode, in which Totec and Lara make an impressive team. Totec, for example, can hold his shield above his head for Lara to jump onto, in order to get to inaccessible areas. He also has a spear, which can be thrown and used as a climbing foothold. In the single-player game (which has different puzzles and environments to the co-op one), Totec rarely features, but he does give Lara his spear at the start.Lara's shooting system has received a radical overhaul: there's no way of reloading, but you're given an ammo meter (refilled from ammo crates) and the rate at which it depletes is governed by the weapon you choose. There's some great weaponry to be collected, including a rocket-launcher which you need in order to take out the later bosses (which, in classic fashion, include a fire-breathing dinosaur), and Lara has an endless supply of bombs she can drop and detonate (which come in handy when you're out of ammo and reduced to the rather ineffective spear). Abundant upgrades and perks add an almost RPG-like element to the game, enhanced by mini-challenges and collectables, which add a decent amount of replay value.There are some brilliant puzzles to solve, which often make impressive use of physics and frequently involve Lara either pushing giant stone balls around or launching them snooker-style with bombs. The general setting is reassuringly familiar: huge, elaborate Mayan temples riddled with traps, situated in the jungle.Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light isn't Tomb Raider as we know it, but in many ways is superior to its pricier, boxed sibling. As it's a download, you approach it with lesser expectations, and because it provides an experience which stays true to the core attractions of the franchise, while eliminating some of its persistent flaws, it proves more satisfying than you initially imagine it would. A handily bite-sized piece of summer entertainment.
These days, posters and art booklets just don't cut it. If you want to produce a special edition that's going to seriously drive those all-important pre-orders, you need to come up with something special. Last month, the StarCraft 2 Collector's Edition arrived in a massive weighty pack, complete with a book, behind-the-scenes DVD, soundtrack CD, and a version of the first title on a USB card.Good, but not quite good enough.Activision has now released details of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 'Prestige Edition'. Priced at £129.99 and only available through HMV, Game and Gamestation it comes with a remote control surveillance vehicle, 'inspired by the RC-XD from Black Ops Multiplayer'.With a range of up to 200 feet, the RC-XD Surveillance Vehicle has a fully-functioning remote camera that transmits both TFT colour video and audio to its operator.Hmmm. This package also comes with all the goodies from the slightly more modest Hardened Edition (£49.99), which boasts a custom Black Ops limited edition medal, an exclusive Black Ops Avatar outfit and a four playable co-operative map pack.So, yes, buy a shooter and get your own miniature spy vehicle. How is anyone going to top that? Give us your suggestions in the comments section...
The original Bioshock was not far off being a classic. Based in a 1950s art-deco underwater city - "Rapture" - the shooter/adventure was a huge artistic leap from the Gears of War/Halo grey and brown hegemony. The sequel was disappointing and - bar the multiplayer - lacked the impact of the first game. 2K have just unveiled the third game in the series and things are looking up. Literally. Bioshock Infinite will take players from the sea to the clouds and is set on a city in the sky.The press release explains:Set in 1912, BioShock Infinite introduces an entirely new narrative experience that lifts players out of the familiar confines of Rapture and rockets them to Columbia, an immense city in the sky. BioShock Infinite is currently planned for release during calendar 2012.Originally conceived as a floating symbol of American ideals at a time when the United States was emerging as a world power, Columbia is dispatched to distant shores with great fanfare by a captivated public. What begins as a brand new endeavor of hope turns drastically wrong as the city soon disappears into the clouds to whereabouts unknown.The player assumes the role of former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt, sent to the lost city to rescue Elizabeth, a young woman imprisoned there since childhood. He develops a relationship with Elizabeth, augmenting his abilities with hers so the pair may escape from a city that is literally falling from the sky. DeWitt must learn to fight foes in high-speed Sky-Line battles, engage in combat both indoors and amongst the clouds, and harness the power of dozens of new weapons and abilities.Judging by the trailer at least - which reminded me of Dreamcast classicSkies of Arcadiaand Pixar's recent movie Up amongst other things - Bioshock Infinite looks like a return to form. The setting alone makes it worth getting excited about.Anyway, what do you think? Excited by Bioshock Infinite? Think the new setting will work?
The UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre today claimed its new Facebook application has prompted 211 new reports of suspicious online behaviour.Facebook, which has 26 million UK monthly unique users,proposed the appafter it refused to introduce Ceop's reporting button to every profile on the site, and it has now been downloaded 55,000 times since it was launched on 12 July.But online safety campaigners are concerned that the spat between Ceop and Facebook, and the preoccupation with the so-called "panic button", is distracting the agency from more wide-ranging efforts to tackle online grooming and abuse.A spokeswoman for Ceop said the agency is keen to move the debate on and emphasise its work in other areas, including discussing a browser plug-in with Microsoft, Mozilla and Google.She added that the 211 reports through the Facebook app would all be classified as very serious offences, such as sexual grooming. Of Ceop's cases for the 12 months up to February this year, 38% or 2,391 reports came through the ClickCeop button.Alex Nagle, Ceop's head of harm reduction, said there is no single solution to online safety. "The UK has adopted a holistic and multi-sector approach which combines education and awareness with a child-victim focus," he added."Many of these were because young people had the ability to easily report directly – from the online environment they inhabit – those who are behaving inappropriately towards them. We cannot prevent all instances of harm to our children in the real or the virtual world, but because of the efforts of many stakeholders the UK is an inherently safer place for them to be online."Facebook's European director of policy, Richard Allan, said the social networking website is looking at other ways to support online safety, including the "site integrity" project which aims to identify suspicious activity and fake profiles at its multilingual support centres."There is a lot more to explore in the use of social media platforms not only in the distribution of centralised safety messages," he said. "We are keen to share expertise with Ceop, recognising their expertise with child safety issues, but also our huge expertise in managing websites and enabling users to seek help when they need it, and in developing a platform which people can use to share information and help each other."The home secretary, Theresa May, has proposed folding Ceop into a new National Crime Agency. Staff have since been concerned the move could mean job cuts and less power, while the government has been evaluating the performance of the agency.Mark Williams Thomas, an independent expert in child safety, praised Ceop for raising the profile of online safety but raised fresh concerns about the priorities of the agency."Ceop has done an incredibly good job in online policing by raising awareness of grooming and predatory paedophiles online," he said. "But this recent spat with Facebook about the report button has lost the focus on what really makes the internet safer for children. One of our biggest concerns is that parents have been put off using Facebook, which is actually one of the safest sites on the internet, and driven onto more dangerous sites."Williams-Thomas criticised the Ceop reporting system which, rather than being a panic button with an immediate response, is an 11-stage process that requires children to submit their full name, address and contact information and agree to be contacted by a policeman at their home."The idea of a reporting button is vital but the current button is inefficient and puts children off," he said.Analysis by another independent safety expert, who did not wish to be named, reinforced those concerns, saying children had needed to ask teachers to help them report problems. "This is not a problem where this type of relationship exists, but for an individual without the necessary support networks it could be a real issue," this source said.
India piled fresh pressure on Research In Motion today when it gave the company less than three weeks to satisfy its concerns over its BlackBerry smartphones or face seeing some services banned.Security fears over BlackBerry services in the countryare thought to spring from the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attackin which 116 people died. Officials suspect  the culprits used encrypted services on the device.The Indian government has set RIM a deadline of the end of August to give it access to data transmitted by BlackBerry's email and messaging services. If the Canadian-based firm does not comply, Indian telecoms operators will be ordered to close the two services down."Our message to RIM and service providers is that if they don't come up with a technical solution by 31 August, then the home ministry will take a view and will shut down BlackBerry Messenger and business enterprises services," a spokesman for the ministry said.This decision follows a meeting of Indian officials to discuss the future of BlackBerry smartphones in the country. Technology experts believe India's tough stance, which follows similar threats in the last two weeks from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, is a major concern for RIM. Tim Renowden, an analyst at Ovum, said a pattern was now forming of governments having problems with RIM's technology and taking action."This is a significant moment. RIM must make a choice about its security architecture and the importance of the security and privacy of its customers, versus the importance of simply being able to operate in these countries," he said."It must decide whether customers are better served with RIM offering services in their market, even with these restrictions, or not," Renowden added.Shares in RIM fell nearly 2% after the deadline was announced. Without BlackBerry Enterprise Service and the BlackBerry Messenger Service, users would still be able to use their smartphones to make calls, send texts and browse the internet.There are between 700,000 and 1 million BlackBerry owners in India, about 500,000 of which are privately owned and do not incorporate the same security measures as enterprise customers' devices. India is one of the Ontario-based company's fastest-growing markets.RIM's devices, which have proved popular among corporate customers around the world, offer data protection services different to most other mobile devices, encrypting information and processing it in foreign centres.The Canadian manufacturer, also insimilar talks with authorities in Saudi Arabia, is facing increasing pressure to allow security agencies access to some of the data passed through its products.While India is a particularly valuable market to the mobile industry, Renowden believes that the situation could become even more serious for RIM if other national governments become involved. He also warned that other manufacturers and operators could also be dragged into the issue."This is not just a BlackBerry issue. Other technology firms encrypt their data, and it would not surprise me if they were also forced to open up their encryption," Renowden said.A deal between authorities and RIM could be seen as a concession, and could be precedent-setting for its operations in other countries.Although RIM declined to comment, a government regulator in Saudi Arabia said earlier this week that the company had successfully completed "part of the regulatory requirements" required to be granted a temporary reprieve from a ban on some services.An official for Saudi Arabia's Communications and Information Technology Commission said RIM and other local telecommunications firms were testing transmitting data through domestic servers.
I run a small business with an ageing fleet of computers. We're looking to replace the three or four that are really struggling (at a guess they must be at least five years old, but could be older) and we'd like to keep the cost down. We don't need monitors and we need Microsoft Office; presumably it is cheaper to buy it bundled with the system. The default option would be Dell, but we were disappointed with our last purchase – a Vista machine that is subject to frequent slowdowns and crashes. Do you have any recommendations?Kate SellersThe simplest and cheapest way to speed up an old PC is usually to add more memory. (This is assuming that you also have at least 1GB of free hard disk space, preferably 2GB, and there isn't a runaway process that is maxing out the processor. Run the Windows Task Manager or, for preference,Process Explorerand make sure nothing is taking 90-100% of the CPU.)It seems your old Windows XP machines have 1GB to 1.5GB of memory. However, I'd recommend 2GB for Windows XP SP3, and 4GB is affordable. XP SP3 will run in 1GB, but if you load one or two Office programs and some browser tabs, there won't be any memory left. You could try fitting 4GB to one machine and see how it performs. This will probably involve throwing away the memory currently installed.Crucial's Memory Advisorwill tell you what you need.Another way to speed up an old Windows PC is to reinstall the operating system, which clears out any accumulated crud. Your PCs may have Windows on a hidden partition on the hard disk. If so, you can easily restore them to factory condition. Obviously all your company data must be backed up, but I'm assuming you already store essential files on a server. The drawback is that you will have to reinstall your business software, including Microsoft Office, and several years of Windows updates.Troubleshooting VistaThe Dell Vostro 200 is a different problem. This machine was launched about three years ago and probably has an Intel Core 2 Duo and at least 2GB of memory. If so, it should run Windows Vista SP1 well. It certainly shouldn't crash. The problem might be a bad installation, in which case, re-installing the operating system might solve it. It could be bad software driver (a common problem when Vista was launched), so check that you have the most up-to-date versions. It might be a virus, so it's worth runningMalwarebytesto see if anything turns up. It might also be a hardware fault.At least Vista has an Event Manager (type eventvwr.msc into the Run box) and a Reliability Monitor, so there should be evidence of any problems in the logs. Try working through the Microsoft Support document 950685,How to troubleshoot performance issues in Windows Vista.New PCsI budget on the basis that a computer costs £1 per day, which is less than I spend on coffee and other vices. If a PC has lasted five years then you've had £1,300 of value on a 5-day week. Now figure out roughly how much the slow PCs are costing in lost work time. I'll be surprised if it's less than £1 a day, which is the equivalent of about 10 minutes work on a minimum wage.The trick for a small business is to spread the expenditure by buying one or two new PCs every year, so you never have to deal with the problem of replacing 10 at once.This doesn't mean you have to upgrade a PC if it's working well – I'm still using a Dell Dimensionbought more than five years ago, one careful owner – but try to keep replacing stragglers with leaders. At the moment, that means PCs with Windows 7, which is more capable, more reliable, more secure, and runs more smoothly than XP.Moving to Windows 7 doesn't require much relearning, and you should be able to run all your old software.Dell does not have much competition in the small business low-cost configurable desktop PC market, and while I'm not very familiar with the Vostro models, they look fairly solid and represent good value for money. However, Vostro is Dell's "value" offering, so you could consider moving up to the OptiPlex range: it's certainly worth comparing prices. You could also look at theLenovo ThinkCentre A58, and HP's new entry-level model, theHP 500B Microtower PC.Buy machines with one of this year's Core i5-6xx processors with Turbo Boost, if you can afford them. They'll last longer.Dell lets you add a version of Microsoft Office 2007 Basic (Word, Excel, Outlook) for £109 plus VAT, which includes a free upgrade to Microsoft Office 2010 Home and Business (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook, plus access to the web-based versions). Buying a separate copy of the 2010 version on DVD from Amazon.co.uk would cost £188, or you could get a KeyCard version (no DVD) for £157. At the moment, it's simpler to buy Office 2010 on DVD, and not much more expensive.Bear in mind that if you buy a full copy of Office, you can uninstall it and then re-install it from your DVD on a different PC. A cut-price pre-installed copy may, like Windows, be locked to the PC on which it's sold.Finally, you may not need new monitors, but think about getting them anyway. Screen sizes have grown a lot in the past five years, and 22in screens are now very reasonably priced. People can be more productive on a bigger screen, and many IT and other staff now use their PCs with two screens.
Little more than a week since Vodafone's customers began installing their HTC Desire Android2.2update (it was actually an update to Vodafone 360 software for Android 2.1), a customer backlash has forced the mobile operator to release the software upgrade without the garish features it chose to set as defaults.When Vodafone rolled out an update for HTC Desire phones running Android last week, complete with branded "360 services" such as "People", "My Web", "360 Shop" and a new splash screen, customers were dismayed to find a host of pre-loaded, unremovable apps.Annoyed users were quick to take to the operator's forums, saying things like: "The absolute last thing anyone wants is misguided Vodafone rubbish that we cannot remove", "I feel you've just ruined my Desire with software I neither need or want" and "it's OUR device that we're paying for, WE should have the right to remove software without voiding warranties".But the company has now turned on its heel, looking to placate those up in arms with the announcement: "The Android 2.2 update for Vodafone HTC Desire users will be based on the HTC open market version of the software and we will customise it to ensure our network settings are installed."For customers who have downloaded the recent 360 update for Android 2.1, we can confirm that the Android 2.2 update will remove the 360 applications and will leave the homepage and bookmarks on your current settings."A Vodafone spokesman said the untarnished firmware upgrade to 2.2 would be ready in thenext seven to 10 days.Fear not all those who had no qualms with the features, an optional download will be available at a later date.And it looks as though Vodafone might be taking its feedback seriously as the Dutch arm of the operator issaid to bedelaying the rollout of the Froyo upgrade to customers in the Netherlands – the 360 update expected to be an optional extra.
What's your favourite piece of technology, and how has it improved your life?The new 3D television – I just got the Sony Bravia, and it's really cool. I can play games and watch football games in 3D – I watched them during the World Cup. You enjoy the distance and the way the third dimension works – you feel like you are inside that world.When was the last time you used it, and what for?I watched the games of the World Cup – many games were shown in 3D, as was the final.What additional features would you add if you could?I believe that with 3D TV, in addition to watching football and playing video games, we need to do live-streaming of events, such as concerts, in 3D.Do you think it will be obsolete in 10 years' time?Maybe we'll have 4D TV by then? Who knows – probably. We will have everything in 3D in 10 years, such as computers and so on. And by then, we won't need the glasses to watch 3D TV any more.What always frustrates you about technology in general?Sometimes technology is developing much faster than our abilities – we have to learn how to use it all the time. But the good news is that technology is helping us to get faster results.Is there any particular piece of technology that you have owned and hated?Sometimes it's so hard to play video games, and I'm always pretty bad at them because I don't spend enough time practising them. So when I play badly, I feel so sorry for myself and all my friends laugh at me. I feel left behind all the time.If you had one tip about getting the best out of new technology, what would it be?For myself, the most important thing is to read the instructions.What's the most expensive piece of technology you've ever owned?I think it was a really expensive Sony projector I got last year – a really cool one.Mac or PC, and why?I think both are good, but for me a PC because you can work more with it. I don't use either one that often.What piece of technology would you most like to own?I always like to have the newest music machine – MP3 player, or whatever. On my travels, I always need to use the newest devices to have a better quality sound. So, I always want to have the newest.•Lang Lang's new album, Live in Vienna, is out on 23 August 2010
Who owns the sky? According to Rupert Murdoch, he does: his BSkyB is challenging the right of Skype, the internet phone service, to register its name as a trademark in Europe, claiming that it is too close to its own Sky brand.Skype is one of the great unheralded success stories of the internet: where Facebook and Twitter are busy shortening attention spans and relieving us of our sense of private space, Skype has quietly changed the way we talk. That Facebook has 500 million users is well known but there are 560 million registered Skype users who have made a total of 250bn minutes of calls since it was founded, seven years ago this month.Using it is easy: all you need is an internet connection and a laptop that has a microphone and, ideally, a webcam. When I first visited the US, 20 years ago, I would ring home by shovelling sackloads of quarters into payphones; these days, thanks to Skype, I can talk daily to friends from anywhere in the world. Calls are free to other Skype users and cheap to everyone else.As a habitual Skype user I have become accustomed to its failings – the frozen webcam image, the metallic sound of the human voice when transported through the air, and the timelag that afflicts some long-distance conversations. There is also the sensitive issue of Skype etiquette – making business calls when still in nightwear is fine, makingvideobusiness calls when wrapped in a towel less so. And yet it is still one of the few things online that has indisputably improved our lives and made the world that much smaller and chattier.
Digital radio maker Pure has launched a service allowing people to buy digital music tracks via their radios.Photo byaloshbennetton Flickr.Some rights reserved.Available on five existing radio sets with more to follow,FlowSongsworks by using an embedded version of Shazam, activated by a button press, to identify tracks being played through the the radio.Although Apple (NSDQ: AAPL) owns nearly nine percent of Pure's holding company Imagination, FlowSongs does not use iTunes Store for distribution. Instead, the retail partner is 7digital, the online music retailer of which HMV (LSE: HMV) owns half.Tracks are priced at 7digital's standard £0.79 per track and stream from a server but can be downloaded via web as DRM-free MP3s. Pure says it will give 90 days for free when users first register and users must also pay £2.99 a year just to use the in-built Shazam, even if they don't want to subsequently buy tracks (after all, Shazam's main mobile apps now are pay-for, too).Of course, there's one big reason radio listeners may not buy tracks from their radio and why this service may not take off - folks are already getting just the same music from the in-built radio stations, most of which nowadays rotate hit songs so frequently that you can bet one of your favourite tracks will be spun in the next half-hour.Clicking on the radio to buy MP3s for other devices, however - that's useful and timely.Notably, FlowSongs is also eschewing the opportunity to add online music to its radios using theunlimited subscription model, rather than conventional a la carte purchasing. A feature like Pandora's personalised radio playback could prove popular.FlowSongs is essentially a partnership between Pure, Shazam and 7digital. But ultimately it's just one service among many…Bear in mind - when UBC Media tried developing similar technology to let people click on their mobiles to buy tracks being played on radio, itlost nearly £2m."A lot of music listening is an impulse purchase," 7digital chief executive Ben Drury told Pure's lengthy Wednesday-afternoonlaunch event, talking up the "one-click" functionality.

Thursday's edition of Chatterbox
Yes, it is merely speculation, but this one could have legs.Engadget are reportingthat Sony Ericsson are using Android 3.0 and "actively and heavily developing a brand new gaming platform, ecosystem, and device (possibly alongside Google) which are already in the late stages of planning." More interestingly for gamers are the potential details of the smartphone - yes, this one might well have Playstation branding.Engadget describe how the smartphone may look:The device is described as cross between the Samsung Captivate and the PSP Go  -- in other words, it's a landscape slider with game controls in place of the typical QWERTY keyboard. The D-pad is here, but instead of the small joystick, the device will have what was described as a "long touch pad" for analog controls, along with standard PSP buttons and shoulder buttons. The phone has a large display, described as being between 3.7 and 4.1 inches with WVGA or better resolution, a 5 megapixel camera that we're told might not be final, and it'll likely have a 1GHz Snapdragon CPU on board. The phone is mostly black with some silver highlights, and the gamepad area is white / silver in color. Apparently it's currently branded as a Xperia device, but it looks like it will carry PlayStation branding as well. Those who've seen the phone say it looks "pretty damn sexy."So what can you expect to play on this phone if it ever gets released. Again Engadget speculates:Games will be graphically in the range of PSX or PSP games, meaning true 3D gaming is headed to Android. Titles currently being shown off seem to be focused around some older PSX as well as new PSP offerings, with God of War, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and LittleBigPlanet possibly on tap, and future plans for titles which incorporate augmented reality features.Assuming this speculation is all correct then, what do you think? Would a Playstation branded smartphone with versions of classic Sony games tempt you away from the PSP/iPhone/DS? And can the phone succeed where the PSP Go - lovely hardware that it is - has failed and get the ecosystem and range of cheaply priced games that any smartphone needs?

Can a videogame teach you to be abetter person? Given that many centre around shooting people in the face, that might seem ridiculous. But games have been used for centuries to teach skills:it is theorised that chess was developed as a training tool for Persian army officers.There are two ways that a game can improve you in your out-of-game life. The first, and hardest, is training you in a skill that is genuinely useful. Chess teaches strategic thinking and forward-planning against an opponent. The other is to motivate better behaviour – parents who award gold stars to encourage their children to tidy up are using a simple token-collecting mechanism. Motivating games are becoming common. Inthe whimsical Chore Wars, flatmates get experience points for washing up or vacuuming and then use them to have adventures online. But games which teach real skills can be dull: Wii Fit is fun enough but only if you compare it to other forms of exercise –and anyway, it's not as good for you as the gym.The Typing of the Dead– a comic typing-training game in which you kill zombies by typing words as fast as possible – was an honourable exception.Channel 4's new game for teenagers –SuperMe– is a bold attempt to combine both formats. It awards points for watching short, engaging videos about emotional skills such as resilience, and it also contains mini-games loosely related to concepts such as "flow" and "connection". The videos are more successful. A platform-jumping game that interrupts the player with a box saying "Fail" is unlikely to teach flow, for example. But it's an interesting experiment; and as the gaming market continues to grow we can expect to see more games that are good for us.
Two new attacks on Android mobile phones and other devices have been uncovered by security firms.One, a piece of malware posing as a movie player, sends text messages to premium-rate numbers, collecting charges applied to the user. Kaspersky Labs, which found the program,claimsit is the first SMS-based malware attack on mobiles running Google's Android operating system. It is thought to be most prevalent among Russian users; the threat to worldwide users is said to be low.Prior to installation, as required by Android's application permissions, the "Media Player" asks users to confirm permission for the application to run "services that cost you money (send SMS messages)".A statement released by Google said:"Our applications permissions model protects against this type of threat. When installing an application, users see a screen that explains clearly what information and system resources the application has permission to access, such as a user's phone number or sending an SMS."Users must explicitly approve this access in order to continue with the installation, and they may uninstall applications at any time. We consistently advise users to only install apps they trust. In particular, users should exercise caution when installing applications outside of Android Market."This application is not thought to have been available in the Android Market, so affected users would have had to change a default setting on their handsets to allow installation of it from an external website.Meanwhile, the British security firmMWR InfoSecurityhas found a flaw in the internet browser of Android versions 1.6 to 2.1, allowing an attacker to remotely access a user's internet history – including sites visited, cookies, usernames and passwords – by code injected in a compromised website, or through an unsecured Wi-Fi network.The vulnerability was reported to Google's Android team in May this year, according to the security firm. A fix present in the latest version of Android, 2.2 Froyo, eradicates the problem, while Android is said to be working on a patch for previous iterations.Alex Fidgen, the MWR commercial director, advised users simply to avoid using unsecured Wi-Fi networks. He said: "This is one of the most serious implications in mobile technologies to date and calls into question fundamental assumptions about mobile phone security."The best way an attacker could affect this is to mimic an unsecured network or spoof an access point – this has been around years. [Attackers are] all using techniques that have been around years now."This is a really serious problem, there's no two ways about it. Mobile companies are not incorporating security enough while smartphone adoption is increasingly widespread."The flaws could have been 'fixed' when the mobile phone companies issued new operating software recently but they did nothing."
Twitter.com is now used by 93 million people worldwide, according to the latest data from comScore. Bear in mind that this is data based purely on visits to the Twitter website, rather than access from third-party applications, and that comScore's metrics are more indicative than accurate. But patterns on growth are particularly interesting.Photo byRosaura Ochoa.Some rights reserved.Figures for June show the number of monthly users up 109% from June 2009 to 92,874,000 with the biggest growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Latin America has 15.4m users and Asia Pacific 25.1m, while Europe has 22.5m and North America 24.9m.Growth was slowest in North America, at 22% year on year, where Twitter is already established. Latin America saw traffic to the Twitter site increase 305% and Asia Pacific 243%.Despite the high profile of Twitter in English-speaking countries its penetration by country was outperformed by new markets. In New Zealand 7.5% of web users access the site, compared with 10.9% in the UK and 11.9% in the US.Indonesia proportionally has the highest level of use with 20.8%, Brazil with 20.5% and Venezuela with 19% - possibly spurred on by President Hugo Chavez's recent enthusiasm for the platform.Again, these figures do not include access from apps likeEchofon,Tweetie(now Twitter's official app) orTweetDeck, but comScore does have figures for Twitter.com access on smartphones: In the US, 8.3% of smartphone users access the site, with 5.7% in the UK and 3.4% in Germany.comScore's Graham Mudd, vice president for search and media, said 75% of web users now access social networking sites each month. ""That makes it one of the most ubiquitous activities on the web. As users around the world have become acquainted with connecting and expressing themselves through social media it has created an environment where new media like twitter can emerge globally in a relatively short space of time."
The British technology firm Plastic Logic has abandoned the Que proReader, itspioneering e-reader device based on plastic electronics, without having shipped a single unit to customers.Plastic Logic announced tonight that it was "moving on" to a second-generation e-reader, and would not sell its original product. The decision is a major blow to the company, which has spent years developing electronic ink technology that allows semiconductors to be printed on plastic rather than being based on silicon.The Que had been under development for several years and wasone of the stars of the CES electronics show in January, but it appears that the success of rival products – such as the Amazon Kindle and Apple's iPad tablet computer – means the original Que is no longer commercially viable."We recognise the market has changed dramatically, and with the product delays we have experienced, it no longer make sense for us to move forward with our first generation electronic reading product," said Richard Archuleta, chief executive of Plastic Logic. "This was a hard decision, but is the best one for our company, our investors and our customers."Last year the Financial Times and USA Today signed deals to offer their newspapers on Plastic Logic's devices. But the future of the Que was looking shaky after the firm refunded pre-orders in June.Plastic Logic did not reveal any details about its plans for its second-generation e-reader, with Archuleta saying only that the company would "take the necessary time needed to re-enter the market".The Que proReader was marketed as a product for business users that wouldallow books and newspapers to be read in an electronic format. There were two versions, both with touch-sensitive monochrome plastic screens. A 4GB unit that supported Wi-Fi and Bluetooth was expected to cost £400, and an 8GB version which included 3G was priced at £495.In comparison, Apple's cheapest iPad costs £429, while Amazon will soon starting shipping a Wi-Fi enabled Kindle for £109. Competition from other e-reader makers such as Sony and Barnes &amp; Noble have also helped to push prices down.Plastic Logic was founded a decade ago by two Cambridge scientists, Sir Richard Friend and Henning Sirringhaus. They raised hundreds of millions of pounds to develop plastic electronics, a technology where semiconducting polymers are deposited onto a plastic surface. Advocates say plastic electronics will ultimately be cheaper than silicon-based circuits.Critics, though, have warned that the technology is not yet mature. Because the polymers are effectively "printed" onto the substrate material, it can be hard to guarantee that they stick in a way that guarantees good connectivity."We are fortunate to have investors who are confident and committed to our company's long-term success in commercialising plastic electronics," Archuleta said. "We thank them, along with our partners and suppliers, and most especially our first customers, for standing with us to pioneer the plastic electronics revolution."Plastic Logic declined to comment on reports that it is in negotiations with Rusnano, a Russian nanotechnology corporation, about an injection of capital that could effectively see Rusnano take control of the firm.
The online crisis-mapping platform Ushahidi has launched a simplified service, a move co-founder Ory Okolloh said is "a landmark" in its short history.Ushahidi'sCrowdmapallows users to begin crowdsourcing reports within minutes, eliminating the need to for technological knowledge to install the service on a server or funds to pay for domain rights."This is huge. It's a landmark," Okolloh said. "This has the potential to take us to the next level in terms of scale, like Blogger did for blogging – Crowdmap has the potential to do that for mapping."One of the challenges behindUshahidiis that it's still difficult to use, you still need some tech knowledge that not everyone has, you needed design skills also, and you needed your own server."A lot of the groups wanting to use Ushahidi didn't have a techy person to assist or couldn't afford a host. The idea is to make the tool more accessible, like withWordPressandWordPress.com."The platform, built primarily by only two people, has been in development since the beginning of this year. The launch marks Ushahidi's intention to move with user demand, Okolloh said."A lot of our development is driven by user feedback – I'd say about 90%, we try not to build tools that are cool, but to build tools that actually work for people."It took a matter of hours after its launch for Crowdmap to be overwhelmed by demand, and Okolloh admitted that the service's popularity may create problems. She said that the company may have to invest in new servers.Ushahidi – Swahili for "witness" – was born out of the ethnic violence in Kenya in 2008 that claimed more than 1,100 lives and displaced about 300,000 people.After a close-fought election, incumbent Kenyan president Mwai Kibaki was announced as re-elected on 30 December 2007. Opposition leader Raila Odinga contested the result, claiming Kibaki's count had been inflated by 300,000 votes.Widespread protests sparked ethnic violence and two months of national chaos ensued, leading to a media blackout. Okolloh took to herKenyan Punditblog, asking fellow citizens to share information before proposing the idea of mapping reports.The first version of Ushahidi was launched after a weekend of development work.

How do you know you are immersed in a game? There are lots of obvious signifiers: time passes unnoticed; you become unaware of events or people around you; your heart rate quickens in scary or exciting sections; you empathise with the characters... Basic stuff. But while we can reel off the symptoms, what are the causes? And why do many games get it wrong?Stimulated by all the Demon's Souls obessives on Chatterbox at the moment, Gamesblog decided to jumble together some tangential thoughts on the subject. This might not make a whole lot of sense. But then neither does video game immersion...Back in May, Toby Gard, the video game designer responsible for creating Lara Croft, wrotean interesting featurefor Gamasutra in which he listed some ways in which developers often accidentally break the immersive spell. One example is poor research, the placing of unanalogous props in a game environment. That might mean an American road sign in a European city, or an eighties car model in a seventies-based game. These errors may seem trivial but as Gard writes,Everyone stores simplified constructions of reality in their mind; schemata that codify the critical features of the world around us. We use our schemata to recognize and interpret everything we experience [...] When we are creating worlds in games, immersion is only possible for the player if we can convince the players that the space is authentic (whether stylized or not.) If the critical features on screen don't match up with the critical features of the player's schemata, then he or she will not be fooled by it.He also writes about the importance of set dressing, of telling a story through background detail; it might be blood stains on a hand rail or propaganda posters on the walls. He cites Fallout 3 as a fine example of a game that brings narrative life to each environment, but I'd add Bioshock and the FEAR series – wherever you look in those games, there's a narrative device staring back at you, and reward for exploration is one of the basic building blocks of an immersive experience.Gard also warns against the use of 'arbitrary spaces': environmental features that are obviously included for gameplay challenge and serve no purpose in the 'reality' of the setting:When a player enters a temple that has no space for worship, or a tomb with no burial chamber nor rhyme nor reason behind its layout, he or she will not be convinced that they are exploring a real place. The worst starting point for a level is a series of featureless, functionless boxes joined by corridors into which gameplay is inserted from a list of gameplay goals.The interesting thing is, I think we pick up on most of these clues almost unconsciously – we don't need to process a whole game environment to understand what it is that's making us feel unimmersed. Indeed, in the midst of a first-person shooter, where we often get mere seconds to assess our surroundings before being shot at, wecan'tprocess the whole environment. Neuroscientists and psychologists are divided on this, but while many accept that we're only able to hold three or four objects from our visual field in our working memory at any one time (in other words, we zone in on a few sparse chunks of detail), others believe we actually have a rich perception and that we're conscious of our whole field of vision even if we're not able to readily access that information. So we know we're in a crap, unconvincing game world, even if we don'tknowwe're in a crap, unconvincing game world. If you see what I mean (and I only occasionally do.)But there's more to immersion than simply responding to what a game designer has created. Dr Paul Cairns, a senior lecturer in Human Computer Interaction at York University is currently studying immersion, and how it relates to human traits of attentiveness, imagination and absorption. "It's a very common term and people colloquially understand what they mean by it," he says. "But now I'm trying to understand, in more of a scientific way, what exactly is happening when people are immersed. We're looking at personality, eye-tracking, people' sense of time when they're playing games. We have to be very careful with terms, because a game that's very immersive is Tetris, but there's no sense that you're IN the experience."Generally, though, what he's finding is that players do a lot of the work toward immersion themselves. People more prone to fantasising and daydreaming – i.e. more absorptive personalities – are able to become more immersed in game worlds. "One of the components we look for in immersion is emotional involvement," says Cairns. "Becoming immersed is partly that you really care about the outcome, for whatever reason, so you need some sort of emotional sensitivity to be able to connect to the game and want to have that connection."So while we're often being told that gamers are drooling, passive consumers of digital entertainment, we're actually highly imaginative and emotional – wehaveto be to get the most out of digital environments that can only hint at the intensity of real-life experiences. Earlier this year Cairns studied European Street Fighter champion Ryan Hart, questioning him on his thoughts and experiences while playing the game – the results seemed to suggest that Hart's skill is as much down to his ability to become fully immersed in the game as it is about his dexterity, hand-eye coordination or capacity to remember sequences of button presses. "What surprised me about Ryan was that he seems to be a really normal bloke!" laughs Cairns. "In fact, quite a senstive and empathic bloke, and that flies in the face of what you might expect a Street Fighter IV champion to be."The best games help us to build immersive emotional reactions through subtle human clues. Believable relationships with other characters is a good example. Three years ago, the Wall Street Journal ranan articlein which it asked if a married man was cheating on his wife by wedding another woman in the virtual world, Second Life. The article quoted Byron Reeves, a professor of communication at Stanford University, who said, "Our brains are not specialized for 21st-century media. There's no switch that says, 'Process this differently because it's on a screen.'"Indeed, experiments conducted at Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab showed that people tend to maintain standard interpersonal protocols while in virtual environments: they move their avatars to make eye contact with other denizens while in conversation, or step away when another character gets too close, reacting to an infringement of personal space, even when the personal space is virtual. Some of the most immersive video games include characters that react realistically to your presence – the muttering scientists in Half-Life, the nuanced conversations in Mass Effect, Yorda taking your hand in Ico – often the hints are miniscule, but they drag us into the game, because we recognise them from our own emotional lives.Of course, it's not rocket science to suggest that we take a lot of ourselves and our own behaviours into games, but it's interesting to consider the extent to which our own imagination shapes what we do and feel. "Being able to imagine and think your way through and experience things differently via a game is really valuable," says Cairns. "People say, 'don't violent games make you more violent?' The point is, theydoexpose you to violence and they do make you imagine, perhaps, what it might be like to be in those situations – but what you do with that is another thing entirely. Some people might think, 'that's what I want to do, I want to be that violent', but most will think, 'crikey, I'd never want to go to war'. Games expose you to things and allow you to think about them in the same way that films do."What Cairns is looking into now is the way in which we lose track of time while immersed in games. "People always think gamers spend hours in front of games and don't realise it, but the research is quite ambiguous about this," he continues. "Over long periods people seem to be able to give quite good estimates of how long they've been playing, so I'm interesting in finding out when does the time vanish and when does it come back? I'm hoping to be able to say that there are these features of games that are telling you how time is getting lost and also how people are then compensating for that when they come back out of the game and work out where they are and what time it is."Immersion, it seems, is weird. We lose ourselves in games, but our selves also shape how we act and react in them; we also often misplace time, but after a certain period, we apparently start to understand again how long we've been playing. I'm pretty sure I do this, but I think it's the structure of the game itself that starts to give us clues about the duration of the session. With an online FPS, we're constantly getting told how long we have on a map, and how long we have between each stage. But when I play something like GTA, which is more seamless, I can lose hours to it without really getting a sense of it.So the inevitable question: how doyoudefine video game immersion, and how much of it is down to the gamer?

Wednesday's edition of Chatterbox
When Rupert Murdochannounced last week that Apple's iPad was a "game changer"and would lead to hundreds of millions of so-called tablet computers being sold globally, it was not just the media world that nodded sagely in agreement. The technology industry is also gearing up for a world in which the desktop PC, laptop computer and smartphone are joined by a fourth member of the home computing family.With the same market foresight and cutting edge design that enabled it to revolutionise the smartphone market with the iPhone, Apple has given itself a commanding lead in this new market. But the iPad is about to have several new competitors, some of which will be made by companies that have scores to settle with Apple boss Steve Jobs, having seen him usurp their place in the mobile phone market.It is the very success that Apple had in the smartphone market and the reaction it has produced – especially from Google – that means Jobs will not enjoy the sort of lengthy market lead with the iPad that he has enjoyed with the iPhone.It is three years since the iPhone first appeared and only in recent months have serious competitors arrived. But with one of the first real alternatives to the iPad expected to be unveiled tomorrow  in New York by Samsung, there will soon be devices able to compete with and perhaps even better Apple's product.Speaking to Wall Street analysts as his News Corp empire announced its financial results on Wednesday, Murdoch said: "I think we're going to see, around the world, hundreds and hundreds of millions of these [tablet] devices" and they are going to change the way that people consume the content created by his media businesses."Murdoch himself reckons Apple will sell about 15m iPads this year and more than 40m by 2012, with more being made by other manufacturers. But estimates for the potential size of the market vary wildly. One thing is certain, these estimates will be wrong.A couple of months before the iPad launched, ABI Research estimated that4m could be shipped this year, rising to 57m a year by 2015. Buton the run-rate reached since the device launched in the US in April, Apple should exceed 4m this month. At the start of the year, research house Gartner reckoned4m tablets would be sold this year– including the iPad. After the iPad's success that estimate is now 14m.To put this into perspective, the tablet market is still small compared with the PC and the mobile phone markets. Sticking with Gartner's figures, the 14m tablets in 2010 compares with an estimate of 1.4bn mobile phones and 366m personal computers.In financial terms, Generator Research reckons by 2014 Apple's iPad business will be worth more than $17bn (£11bn), while the worldwide smartphone market will be worth $65bn and the laptop market $195bn.But while the figures for tablet computers may be comparatively small, the technology industry reckons tablets will fundamentally shape the way that consumers interact with digital content in the future. Getting in on the ground floor, so to speak, is crucial.As with so many technology fads, the industry has been here before. A decade ago,Bill Gates unveiled the Tablet PCand the following year told the Microsoft faithful that the new devicewould become the most popular form of PC within five years. Five years later, Microsoft was still trying. It teamed up with Intel and Samsung for Project Origami to work on smaller handheld digital media and gaming devices. They also failed to capture the public's imagination.Apple, however, has got its timing right. Whether by luck or judgment, the iPad has emerged during a confluence of events. The ubiquity of broadband internet access in the developed world has created a generation of web users who want instant access and interactivity with media, from music and film to books and newspapers. The media industry, meanwhile, is desperate to move away from the mere "digitisation" of its traditional product so it fits on a PC screen and is ready to experiment with new formats. As the media industry explores new ways of creating content in order to generate new revenues, a tablet represents a perfect half-way house between the sit-forward world of the keyboard-based PC – where online advertising has so patently failed to deliver revenues – and the passive sit-back world of traditional circulation and display advertising-based print media.The iPhone and its host of imitators, meanwhile, have got consumers accustomed to the idea of using touch as their main point of interaction with content, rather than a keyboard and a mouse. Finally, the arrival of operating systems designed specifically for touch-based smartphones means manufacturers have something ready to use, rather than having to shoehorn into their tablet computers pared-down but still bulky "mobile" versions of PC operating systems.After the arrival of Apple's iOS, when the first iPhone appeared, Google realised the mobile phone industry could not be relied on to create a viable competing software platform on its own. So it created its own operating system, Android.This year, sales of Android devices have alreadyovertaken sales of iPhones in the USandsales in the UK are already up more than 300%as the result of just one new device, the HTC Desire. Worldwide, Android is expected to overtake iOS in terms of global smartphone shipments during 2012, according to forecasts from iSuppli. The company reckons Android will be used in 75m smartphones at this point, up from 5m last year, while iOS usage will be 62m units, up from 25m.Now Android is headed for the tablet market. The two biggest names in communications and software are both still lagging behind. Microsoft is unclear whether tablets should use its Windows 7 software – which does support touch – or base devices on its Windows Phone software, while Nokia has turned to Intel for help in creating new tablet software under the MeeGo brand.BlackBerry, meanwhile, has upgraded its software for touch and looks ready to explore tablets, while Hewlett-Packard recently bought Palm, which will provide it with a solid software base for the next generation of smartphones and tablets."How long did it take for competitors to compete with the iPhone?" asks Carolina Milanesi, from Gartner's mobile devices team. "You are talking three years. But with the tablet I really do not think that is going to be the case. A lot of the things that took time in the smartphone market are already there in tablets. We continue to see Apple dominating the segment for the next three years or so but you will see devices that are very close to the iPad very quickly."
Last week,Microsoftreleased tantalising pictures of its latest device which got bloggers talking about a tablet. The division of Microsoft behind the account, however, makes keyboards, webcams and mice so it's more likely that the flat matt black device in the photos is Microsoft's rival to Apple'srecently announced trackpad. Also Microsoft has a patchy record when it comes to consumer trends. While the Xbox has taken a valuable place in the games console market, its Zune portable music player is still years behind Apple's iPod in terms of sales.Last month chief executive Steve Ballmer said developing Windows-based tablet computers is "job one urgency" for the software group. He added "we have got to make things happen with Windows 7 on slates" but while the firm's latest PC version of its software has touch capabilities, analysts have warned that putting the whole operating system on a tablet will mean manufacturers will have to use a lot of memory and fast processors on the device, which will increase its price. Also they question whether Microsoft still has the tablet market wrong: consumers do not want to do everything they can do on a desktop on a tablet. It is not merely a new form factor, it is a new kind of device. Some manufacturers are looking at whether its Windows Phone software - which also enables touch as well as the viewing of Microsoft Office documents - is not a better system on which to base Microsoft tablets. Either way, Ballmer said Microsoft is working with partners including Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Asus, Dell, Samsung, Toshiba, and Sony on tablets. Many of those firms, however, also have other software in mind.Google, meanwhile, has long been rumoured to be working on its tablet computer, most recently in conjunction with Verizon (that story, however, may have been a confusion of the recent news that Verizon is actually working with Motorola to produce a tablet device aimed at the home entertainment market and running Google's Android software). But there are questions as to why Google needs an own-brand tablet while many manufacturers are to produce their devices based on its Android. The company was planning a smartphone called the Nexus One because it feared that the iPhone was running away with the market and the industry needed to be shown what could be done with Android. But now that a plethora of good quality Android devices are appearing, Google has halted the Nexus programme. The real question among technology watchers is whether Google will work closely with one or two tablet manufacturers to create devices based on its Chrome OS software, which is aimed at web-enabled laptops and is due out later this year.The handset makersSeveral mobile phone manufacturers are already working on tablets based on Google's Android. First out of the blocks will be a tablet fromSamsung. The Korean hardware company is expected to give more details  today but it will run Android and have a 7 inch screen, making it smaller than the iPad, but including a camera and accept memory cards. There is also talk of a second device with a tablet screen on one side and e-book reader on the other. While its first tablet is likely to use Android, Samsung also seems to want to use its new Bada operating system - which is used by its recently launched Wave mobile phone - for tablets. It remains to be seen whether consumers will want yet another operating system to deal with. Domestic rival,LG, is also working on an Android-based tablet which is scheduled for launch by the end of the year.RIM, the company behind theBlackBerry, is rumoured to be working on a rival to the iPad,dubbed the BlackPad, which is scheduled for launch in November. Nokia, meanwhile, tried to enter the so-called netbook market with itsown 3G Booklet last year. It ran Windows 7 and was hardly a success. Since then, the Finnish mobile phone company has teamed up with Intel to develop software better suited to laptops and tablets,under the MeeGo banner. The first device is likely to be a smartphone which could be out for ChristmasandNokia seems to be in no rush to produce a tablet.Motorolais working withVerizonon an Android-powered tablet. The question is whetherHTCwill follow up its success in the Android-powered smartphone market with a tablet.The PC manufacturersTablets running Windows have been in the market for some time from manufacturers such asFrance's ArchoswhileLenovo,HPand others have released laptops – called convertibles – whose screens swivel to turn them into tablets. Taiwan'sAcerand China'sAsusare preparing tablets with Microsoft software. The latter will also release tablets using Android. But many consumers will prefer a household name when they take the plunge into tablets. One of the first was the Streak fromDell, but it is smaller than the iPad andseems more like a smartphone.BT, wants to get in on the tablet act and is developing atouchscreen version of the traditional landline telephone, which raises the unwelcome spectre of Amstrad's failed eMailer device.Toshibahas produced a dual-screen tablet running Windows 7 and is working on a single screen tablet called SmartPad, which may run Android.Hewlett-Packard, meanwhile, is believed to have been working on a device called theZeenwhich runs Android and looks more like an e-reader.Tech watchers reckon HP's real push into tablets will come on the back of its recent acquisition of smartphone designerPalm. The e-reader market, of course, already has the Kindle fromAmazon- which has just been upgraded - and theSonye-Reader, although both are likely to be superseded, over time, by tablets.
Just out - the latest trailer ofAragorn's Quest, the new Lord of the Rings game for the Wii. Tolkien's world has a mixed history when it comes to games. For everyHobbit on the Spectrumthere was aHobbit on the PS2. Aragorn's Quest looks quite promising though. What do you think?
Aleks Krotoski is joined in the studio by Jemima Kiss, Robert Andrews and mendeley.com's Victor Henning for this week's packed programme. The team tackle the web: collaboration, governance and net neutrality before sliding smoothly into a discussion of social innovation with Charles Leadbeater.First up, what does the Google-Verizon deal mean for how we access the web and who can build content for it? The team are divided. What do you think?In other Google news, what happened to Wave? Jemima and Robert weigh in on why the search engine's aggregated email/instant message/collaboration service failed to live up to expectations, and what this means for the "iterate and iterate often" culture of web development.Richard Buchanan phones in to talk about the Facebook users' union, a new group on the social network that seeks compensation from Mark Zuckerberg himself for the data the site keeps about its membership. Jemima throws in a bit of business advice, free of charge.Victor pitches mendeley.com, a collaborative tool and social networking facility for researchers, and discusses the ways the web has challenged intellectual property and academic discourse. He proposes a few changes he'd like to see in how research is published and shared.Finally, Charles Leadbeater, author of We Think, tells Aleks how important web openness is for social innovation.All this, plus the team's predictions on who would win in a playground fight – Apple, Facebook or Google – on this week's Tech Weekly.Don't forget to ...• Comment below• Mail us attech@guardian.co.uk• Get ourTwitter feedfor programme updates or follow ourTwitter list• Join ourFacebook group• See ourpics on Flickr/Postyour tech pics
If you thinknet neutralitysounds boring, think again. While the debate has been bubbling along for years, it is a concept that could mean the end of open, free and equal internet of today that we take for granted.So what does it mean?Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic – content, platforms, and websites – should be treated equally by the networks that deliver them.The internet today is, mostly, a level playing field. We pay a fee to have access to the internet. Web services pay to host their content and to for that content to be accessible. And internet service providers pay for the bit in between – the connection.What telecoms firms want is the right for companies to pay a premium to have their content delivered faster than rival content, or to establish new layer of faster internet on which to to serve paying, premium services.That would leave non-commercial sites on a poorer, slower web where they would find it harder to attract readers – changing the democratic nature of the internet. It would also mean poorer users, or those in the developing world, would find it harder to access the "full" internet experience.Photo byJasonWaltonon Flickr.Some rights reserved.Against net neutralityThose against net neutrality are the big telecoms networks in the US - Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast and others - because they want to introduce tiered, prioritised services. That could mean Yahoo, for example, paying to have its search results delivered faster, through a faster network, than Microsoft's Bing.Computer scientistDavid Farberis one of those who has cautioned against net neutrality saying it may hinder the progress of new, innovative networks. "An updated internet could offer a wide range of new and improved services," he told the Washington Post in 2008. "including better security against viruses, worms, denial-of-service attacks and zombie computers; services that require high levels of reliability, such as medical monitoring; and those that cannot tolerate network delays, such as voice and streaming video. To provide these services, both the architecture of the Internet and the business models through which services are delivered will probably have to change."For net neutralitySeveral high-profile figures from the tech industry have spoken out in defence of the net neutrality principle, including the internet protocol co-inventor Vint Cerf and web inventor Tim Berners-Lee.Berners-Leehas said: "Control of information is hugely powerful. In the US, the threat is that companies can control what I access for commercial reasons. In China, companies could control what users access for political reasons. Freedom of connection with any application to any party is the fundamental social basis of the internet."Where did the term come from?Network neutrality isn't a new concept in telecoms. In the US, the "common carrier" laws ensured that customers of different phone networks could talk to each other. Regardless of who and how they paid to access the telephone network, once they are on the line, they can call anyone.The term was popularised in the late 1990s but became commonplace when the arguments were picked up by the press around 2006. In the US, coverage has centered around the Federal Communications Commission which upheld a complaint against ComCast for illegally restricting paying web users from using filesharing services. In the UK, "traffic shaping" can similarly be seen as a precursor to wider tiers of internet use with ISPs commonly demoting and even blocking P2P traffic, for example. ISPs in the UK have also indicated they are concerned about services that put pressure on their networks like the BBC's video traffic, whichmay lead to them charging.What does this Google-Verizon pact mean?Google has always said it supports net neutrality, whereas Verizon is one of the biggest networks in the US and wants to be allowed to charge for different services. But the two have agreed aproposal, rather than a formal deal, which listed key principles that business and regulators could work with:• ISPs cannot discriminate against any service in an anti-competitive way.• ISPs cannot block consumers from any legal service.• ISPs have the right to manage and prioritise web traffic.• ISPs must be transparent about how they are managing services.• The FCC would enforce on a case-by-case basis, and have its regulatory powers over broadband services restored.• A fixed part of all phone fees would be dedicated to investment in broadband networks.And the last and most significant two:• ISPs can introduce new and different internet services, such as 3D.• Wireless services are exempt from all these proposals, apart from the condition of transparency.Photo bygt8073aon Flickr.Some rights reserved.First, new types of content and new types of services on new types of network – this is the internet of the future. While the internet today operates as one largely unified system, the internet of tomorrow will need investment and innovation to build new features and functionality we can only dream of.Second, the desktop is dying - wireless, mobile networks are the future. So the internet of the future will operate on the network of the future which will largely be a wireless one. Under the Google-Verizon proposal, wireless services would be exempt from all these requirements, which means ISPswouldbe able to discriminate against competitors andwouldbe able to block access to a service even if it was legal. It's the same principle as your mobile operator charing you more to call a friend on another network – but with everything from video, to email, gaming, music – anything you do on your phone.The FCC isn't too pleased that Google and Verizon are trying to dictate policy, however. Commissioner Michael J Coppssaid: "Some will claim this announcement moves the discussion forward. That's one of its many problems. Itistime to move a decision forward – a decision to reassert FCC authority over broadband telecommunications, to guarantee an open internet now and forever, and to put the interests of consumers in front of the interests of giant corporations."Net neutrality campaigners say Google's response is contradictory, hence thenegative responseto the Verizon pact. Despite its proclaimed commitment to net neutrality, Google has proposed a future where ISPs can build and charge new networks as they wish.
Foursquare addicts will know how desirable that mayor badge is (congratulationsJosh, Guardian mayor as of yesterday morning) and so it follows that Foursquare has launched astoreselling real badges, stickers and Foursquare T-shirts.It's a big win for Foursquare, which gets a new if modest revenue stream on the side (five badges for $5, 10 stickers for $5 or $20 for a T-shirt) and valuable advertising among the geek fraternity.Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley got Foursquare cookies from his mum for his birthday in June – but those aren't for sale through the Foursquare store just yet. Photo bydpstyleson Flickr. Some rights reserved.For players, it's taking the status game into the real world, and everyone likes a good badge. Though you could argue they are more prestigious when 'earned' by visiting tech conferences.Cafepressgave brands (or anyone, in fact) the ability to sell their own branded stuff years ago, so there's nothing new in that. But Foursquare is right on the meme.In 10 years, these might be geek collectors' items on eBay. Or we will long since have forgotten about Foursquare, which was taken over by Facebook/Yahoo/Google and then evaporated. But there's a nice idea for a little startup earner all the same.
Police in South Korea have raided Google's Seoul headquarters as part of an investigation into data collected by the company's Street View cars.Police official Ahn Chang-soo said computers and hard drives had been seized in the raid by 19 Korean National Police Agency (KNPA) officers on the Google premises in the South Korean capital."[The police] have been investigating Google Korea on suspicion of unauthorised collection and storage of data on unspecified internet users from Wi-Fi networks," a statement released by the KNPA added.A Google spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that the police have visited Google Korea in conjunction with their investigation around data collection by Street View cars. We will cooperate with the investigation and answer any questions they have."South Korea is one of many countries –including the UK– investigating the data collected by Google's Street View cars. The search giant has admitted to accidentally intercepting fragments – amounting to 600MB – of personal data through Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries as it sought to map towns and cities.In May this year, Alan Eustace, a senior vice president in engineering and research at Google,wrote on the company's blog: "It is now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open Wi-Fi networks, even though we never used that data in any Google products."In June, the company said it had deleted private wireless data collected in Austria, Denmark and Ireland.A string of code in the production systems of Street View cars allowed Google to retrieve and store information about the networks' location, names and Media Access Control (MAC) addresses on wireless networks that were not password protected.Last month the UK information commissioner ruled that Google is unlikely to have collected "significant amounts of personal data" with its Street View mapping cars,sayingthere is "no evidence as yet that the data captured by Google has caused or could cause any individual detriment".Figures collated and published earlier this year by analysts Aqute Intelligence showed that nearly half of the 60 worldwide legal or criminal investigations being faced by Google relate to the company's Street View service.Street View cars have been collecting Wi-Fi data in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Macau, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the US.
The threat of a ban on certain BlackBerry functions has been temporarily lifted in Saudi Arabia, a government regulator revealed today.Saudi Arabia's Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) said BlackBerry manufacturer Research In Motion (RIM) had successfully completed "part of the regulatory requirements" over the weekend, allowing a temporary reprieve to the ongoing threat of a blockage to services including email and web browsing on the company's handsets.Authorities in Saudi Arabia had said some BlackBerry Messenger services would be blocked from Friday, 6 August, citing security fears about the way the Canadian technology firm encrypts personal data on its devices. RIM transmits data through servers based outside of the Middle East, making government monitoring of customer content difficult."In light of the positive developments toward addressing some of the organisational requirements by the providers, the commission decided to allow BlackBerry Messenger service to continue," the Saudi regulator said in a statement, adding that it would "continue working with the service providers to complete the rest of the regulatory requirements".A CITC official said on Sunday that RIM and other Saudi mobile firms were testing domestic servers transmitting data in addition to RIM's server in Canada. Mobile phone service providers in the country – including RIM – had been given a 48-hour extension ending Monday night to address security concerns,according to Reuters.US State Department officials reportedly met with RIM officials yesterday to discuss the deal with the Saudi authorities.An RIM spokeswoman declined to comment.The manufacturer hadearlier saidthat "any claims we provide, or have ever provided, something unique to the government of one country that we have not offered to the governments of all countries, are unfounded".Negotiations arethought to be underwaywith a number of governments in the Middle East – including the United Arab Emirates, India and Saudi Arabia – with a view to coming to a compromise that would suit the authorities and RIM.The UAE has said BlackBerry services will be switched off from 11 October in the country if negotiations break down.
Google and Verizon have put forward a joint policy framework aimed at allaying fears the two companies could bring an end to the internet principle of net neutrality.Ina joint op-edin the Washington Post today, the Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt, and his Verizon counterpart, Ivan Seidenberg, outlined their "commitment to an open internet", saying "blocking and degrading internet traffic is antithetical to the principles of openness and consumers' expectations".Long-running talks between the US media and telecoms regulator, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and a host of big internet companies – including Google and US telecoms operator Verizon –broke downlast week amid reports of the two companies trying to forge a deal in private,something they both denied.But the two companies have been discussing the concept of net neutrality – an internet tenet stating that all content should be delivered at the same speed on a level playing field – for some time.Ina post on the Google Public Policy blog late yesterday, Alan Davidson, the search giant's director of public policy, and Tom Tauke, Verizon's executive vice president of public affairs, outline the future for net neutrality in the US.Here's some initial reaction from around the web:Richard Adams, the Guardian"One cynical way of reading this is to think of Google and Verizon as two syndicates carving out a piece of the action: Google gets a commitment to net neutrality over the standard, wired internet that people access via computers at home or at work, while Verizon gets far weaker regulation on wireless networks accessed via smartphones."Why does Google feel it needs to work with Verizon on this? Verizon in the US is in a uniquely powerful position of straddling both wired and wireless access, since it operates one of the two major wireless networks (AT&amp;T running the other), while also being a major wired ISP competing with the likes of cable provider Comcast."[...] Needless to say, the lack of regulation applying to wireless access and the possibility of future 'designated services' doesn't please anyone outside the telecoms industry, or indeed at the FCC."Dan Gillmor, Salon.com"But here's the rub: You should not trust Verizon or other carriers, or Google for that matter, to follow through in ways that are truly in the interest of the kind of open networks the nation needs. Throughout the conference call, we kept hearing references to the 'public internet' – an expression that leads inescapably to something else."If Schmidt was telling the truth when he said Google's overwhelming focus will remain on the public internet, such as his promise that YouTube will remain there, that's great. I have no reason to disbelieve him, and Google's track record to date is strong on this issue. But plans change, managements change, and corporate goals change."Alexis Madrigal, The Atlantic"If open networks are good, why should wireless be different? They don't make the case in these documents for why the 'unique technical and operational characteristics' should change the fundamental underlying principle of the network. That's not to say there isn't a good argument, but it's certainly not in either the blog post or the policy document."More troubling is that the language of the wireline net neutrality is squirrely. The companies suggest that they would be maintaining 'net neutrality' on wireline services, but they'd allow 'additional or differentiated services' over their networks."[...] Again, this is just a policy paper, but this seems like a slippery definition of what is and is not internet traffic. Why not carry these 'additional services' over the internet, where they would be subject to the net neutrality rules that these companies claim to think is a good idea?"Stacey Higginbotham, GigaOm"The good news is nothing about this compromise has any teeth without the FCC deciding to made it part of its official rules on network neutrality. However, given the FCC's precarious position as a broadband regulator and a lack of support from Congress on this issue the temptation to accept this compromise as good for everyone may force a version of network neutrality that leaves mobile, one of the fastest areas of innovation on the web, out of the new rules. It also enables an alternative version of the public internet that could lead to the creation of a first-class and a second-class system of packet delivery."Siva Vaidhyanathan, law and media studies professor,quoted by NPR"I'm concerned [that] if the FCC uses this as a template, we will create a backwater on the traditional internet and allow for a lot of top-down control in the very areas where use seems to be moving."John Bergmayer, Public Knowledge"Overall, there's a lot that's bad about this proposal, and it shouldn't form the basis of legislation in Congress or of rules by the FCC."The biggest problem with the framework is that, while purporting to support 'the open internet', it draws illogical distinctions on the basis of what technology you use to access the internet, and between 'the public internet' (Verizon's mantra on the press call) and 'additional online services'."If the Verizon/Google proposal is adopted, the window of openness that allowed companies like [Schmidt's] to thrive and grow will be closed. The internet could be frozen in 2010, with companies like his on top."Karl Bode, Broadband DSLReports"The idea that Google and Verizon think nobody will notice they've proposed a network neutrality solution that excludes wireless while nuzzling their multi-billion-dollar Android partnership seems almost obnoxiously cocky. Arrogance is par for the course for Verizon, but assuming your audience is comprised of complete morons seems like new territory for Google."It seems like common sense that telecom regulators, not the sector's wealthiest players, should be dictating the beat of this particular policy drum. The fact that this isn't the case speaks to the FCC's murky leadership over the past year. The framework used to create any internet policy rules shouldn't be a game of policy make believe focused on protecting the revenues of the wealthiest constituents – it should be the brain trust of a broad collective, including consumers, smaller carriers, and truly independent experts."
Tuesday's edition of Chatterbox
Treyarchhas released a first multiplayer trailer fromCall of Duty: Black Ops, the latest addition to the gazillion-selling CoD series. Set throughout the Cold War, the game follows a secretive spec-ops team as it operates behind enemy lines in a series of deniable missions.The developer is remaining tight-lipped about the intricacies of the plot, but an earlier teaser suggested that it may involve the testing of performance-enhancing drugs on soldiers. Some interesting weapons have been revealed, however, including a scoped crossbow, and some nasty dragons breath shotgun shells that blast out a plume of fiery death – both should come in handy during deathmatch face-offs.Black Ops is due out on November 9 on PC, PS3, Wii, X360 and DS. You can find out much, much more by checking outour preview of the game...
