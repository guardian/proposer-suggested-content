Uber, the under-fire taxi-hailing app, has hit out at London’s transport regulator, Transport for London (TfL), for taking it to the high court on Monday in the latest threat to its explosive growth in the London taxi market.The high court case, which will determine whether the Uber app breaks the law by effectively acting as a meter, is piling on the pressure for the ride-hailing firm.Uber, which is backed by investors including Wall Street institution Goldman Sachs, is already facing the threat of a major crackdown on its business practices in London followingthe announcement earlier this week of a public consultation.Related:Uber fights back with petition after TfL launches consultationAn Uber spokesman said on Thursday: “The proposals, and the court case, are designed to protect the black-cab industry rather than help them adapt to what people want.”TfL, which provisionally took the view that Uber’s app was lawful, subsequently referred that decision to the court. “The court will be dealing with what is a distinguishing part of the Uber offering,” said Liam Griffin, chief executive of Europe’s biggest minicab firm, Addison Lee. “This court case could potentially have a devastating effect on Uber’s London business,” he added.Uber is said to be confident it can survive a defeat in the high court. However, it is concerned that, if the case goes against them, it might need to make changes to the way its app operates that will make it less user friendly.The legal spat over whether the Uber app breaches the law comes towards the end of a tough week for the firm, which has 18,000 drivers (called registered partners) in the capital.In London, the group was shellshocked by TfL’s decision to consider new proposals – including making passengers wait at least five minutes for a ride – after talks with the rest of the industry.Related:Why won't Boris Johnson let Uber break the cab 'cartel'? Votes, maybe?The firm is facing problems in countries all over the worldas it disrupts existing taxi services. In France, two of Uber’s executives were in court to face criminal charges of illegally organising taxi services through the company’s low-cost UberPop service. The trial has been delayed until mid-February so that both sides can review more data.In the Netherlands on Tuesday, the group’s Amsterdam offices were raided as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into whether it is violating the country’s laws over a super-cheap service using untrained drivers. On the same day, in Rio de Janeiro, Uber and other similar smartphone taxi apps were banned from operating.London’s black-cab operators, who number more than 25,000, have long been arguing they want Uber to face tougher regulations so that the competition can be fairer. Uber, meanwhile, is arguing that regulation of the whole industry should be reduced, while adhering to tough safety standards.The black-cab drivers were given a boost yesterday when Hailo, an app firm, signed a new deal that boosts their tech offering in the battle against Uber. The black cabs have other app deals, with groups such as Gett and TaxiToo.Uber has launched a petition, which has so far attracted nearly 120,000 names, to support its fight against the new TfL proposals in London. It says: “These rules make no sense”.Related:Want a cheap Uber taxi? Wait till no one else wants one“We understand that black-cab drivers are feeling the pressure from services like Uber,” the petition states. “But the answer is to level the playing field by reducing today’s burdensome black-cab regulations – not to introduce rules that will be bad for riders, drivers and London.”TfL is chaired by Boris Johnson, who only two weeks ago branded black-taxi drivers as luddites. Yesterday, seven London Tory councillors, led by Peter Cuthbertson, asked Johnson to “think again” on Uber, concerned that his relatively relaxed view about the firm was changing.Cuthbertson told the Guardian: “There are some concerns with Uber, such as its policy on insurance, but these proposals don’t look at that. It’s almost like they’ve asked what are the key features of Uber that people like and how do we make them illegal?”Johnson is said to be worried by the increased number of minicabs in the capital and the congestion this is causing. The number of licensed private hire vehicles has gone from around 35,000 in 2005 to just over 60,000 now.Simon Walker, director general of the business-friendly Institute of Directors, has appealed to Johnson to uphold his free market ideals over the situation.This article was amended on 2 October
The question is the usual: PC or Mac? I am a very normal PC user. My daughter says “when you try Mac, you never come back”. I bought an iPhone 5c and sold it after two months …UgoThat’s a very unusual question nowadays, but the stock answer remains the same: pick the one that does what you want at a price you are willing to pay. Since you don’t appear to have any specific requirements, and you haven’t given me a budget, you will have to decide. Your money, your choice.However, people tend to like what they know, and they are generally averse to change. If you are “a very normal PC user” then switching to Mac OS X would involve some relearning. (Of course, it’s the same for Mac users going the other way, which – despite your daughter’s claim – some do.)Switching costsIf you were starting from scratch, you’d have nothing to lose. As a PC user, however, switching involves giving up whatever Windows expertise you have and investing time in learning a new system. Whether this matters depends on how well you know Windows.The switching costs include finding new programs to replace whatever you’re using on Windows, and importing your old data into your new system. This can prevent businesses from switching, and it can make life difficult for hobbyists with special interest software that Macs lack.On the other hand, it may be a non-issue for most ordinary consumers, because of the trend towards web services. The more things you do online in a browser, the simpler it is to switch platforms.There’s also a financial cost to switching, because the average Windows machine is much cheaper than the average Mac, especially if you factor in the cost of AppleCare. Of course, the extra cash does buy you a faster, better-made machine, as it should. But you may be paying for features you don’t need, or can’t really afford. A £150-£350 laptop might meet your needs, but Apple doesn’t sell laptops at those prices.Of course, there are also benefits to switching. For example, Macs require less maintenance than PCs, and are generally easier to update. (Whether Windows 10’s continuous updates will remove this advantage remains to be seen.) Also, Mac OS X is not a major target for a large, criminal malware industry. These benefits are somewhat hard to quantify, but they are real.Hardware optionsAlthough Macs are a viable alternative, most people will still buy Windows machines most of the time. Partly this is because Windows machines are cheaper. Partly it’s because Windows offers a wider range of choices from a bigger range of companies for a broader range of uses. PC companies offer everything from PCs on USB sticks to vast server farms. Indeed, several PC manufacturers offer whole ranges of PCs for different users, including budget buyers, consumers, high-end consumers, gamers,SOHOusers, enterprises, technical users and so on. Dell, for example, offers the Inspiron, XPS, Alienware, Vostro, Latitude, Optiplex and Precision ranges custom-designed for these different markets.Finally, there are several popular PC formats with no Mac equivalents. These include 2-in-1s that double as laptops and tablets, touch-screen PCs with high-resolution stylus/pen input, and expandable tower systems. With Windows, you can also have a PC built to order, or build your own with the help of websites likePCPartPicker.Think about your current PC use, and whether a different type of machine would suit you better. You may decide to stick with a traditional clamshell design, but it’s worth considering alternatives now, and what you might need in the future.The whole productThe vast range of options is one of the most valuable things about the Windows ecosystem, even if you only buy one PC. It’s part of what marketing strategists call“the whole product”.In marketing terms, “the whole product” consists of the core product (in this case, a PC) plus things like service and support (the expected product), add-ons such as software and peripherals (the augmented product), and expected future developments (the potential product).For example, when you buy a Windows PC, you are also buying the ability to use thousands of peripherals, hundreds of thousands of applications, plus all the Windows magazines, books, YouTube videos, websites and allied services from educational courses to repair shops. You are buying the ability to switch to a different manufacturer if your current supplier stops innovating or goes bust, and the reliable expectation that you will be able to buy an improved product in the future.Historically, the Windows PC has almost always been a better “whole product” than the Mac, regardless of the quality of individual devices. The interesting question is what kind of “whole product” Apple and Microsoft are building for the future.Future platformsWe know what Microsoft is doing. First, it is converging its three platforms – Windows, Windows Phone and the Xbox One games console – on a single operating system with universal apps that run on all three screens: phone, PC and TV. (This is a programming platform: it doesn’t mean they should have the same user interface.) Users can store their data anywhere, but keeping it in the cloud makes it accessible to all the different devices.Second, Microsoft is extending its reach across its rivals’ platforms, starting with Office 365. Microsoft now offers dozens of apps not just for Windows and Windows Phone, but also for Apple iPhones and iPads, and for Google Android smartphones and tablets. Microsoft is a software company, and wants its software on every popular device.We don’t really know what Apple is doing, because it doesn’t tell us. However, it makes most of its money from selling devices – mostly from selling iPhones – and generally isn’t interested in software unless it increases its hardware sales. (For example, Apple only ported iTunes to Windows in order to sell iPods.)Apple’s “whole product” is therefore focused on Apple hardware. It’s building a platform where Apple devices work together, rather than with other people’s. You can see the trend with Mac OS X becoming more like iOS, and withContinuityin Mac OS X Yosemite increasing the integration between Macs and iOS devices.Continuity’s features must be very useful if you own a Mac and an iPhone, but it means giving a lot of power – and a lot of money – to one company. Many people are happy to have Apple operating as a gatekeeper controlling innovation, and they are perfectly entitled to make that choice. But I want to use products from all the big ecosystems – including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft – so I’m not.You don’t say why you got rid of your iPhone 5c, but according to the “halo effect” theory, owning an iPhone is supposed to inspire you to buy other Apple products. If that didn’t work, it might be the wrong ecosystem for you. To find out, perhaps your daughter should lend you hers....Have you got another question for Jack? Email it toAsk.Jack@theguardian.com
Changes to the Consumer Rights Act have come into effect in the UK today, and with key amendments designed to deal with software purchases and digital goods, there are some important gains for gamers.Most obvious is the provision of a clear 30-day period in which consumers can return goods that they deem to be faulty, and ask for a refund or a replacement. In the past, the act ambiguously required that goods needed to be returned within a “reasonable time”, which allowed more wriggle room for retailers, who could also insist on just offering a repair.The act makes clear that goods must be fit for purpose and “free from minor defects”. With an increasing number of major games now being released with significant technical issues – including the likes of Battlefield 4, SimCity and the PC version of Batman: Arkham Knight – consumers will now be in a much stronger position to request a refund from the supplier of the game if it won’t load or can’t access online features.“The reasonable time has been clarified, which is good,” says Alex Tutty of entertainment law firm, Sheridans. “Retailers previously relied on this – especially if you think about a game that can be completed in 10 hours; they would say ‘you can’t return this after 20 days’.”The act applies, not just to physical boxed game releases from online or highstreet stores, but to digital games purchased from online sites like Steam, Origin, or the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network stores. Most of these have refund policies in place, but the new act makes their specific responsibilities much clearer. Titles will have to match the descriptions given on the website and be fit for the indicated purpose.“The update clarifies that the sale of goods act will now apply to digital products,” says Tutty. “Previously you had more rights if you bought a game on disc, now you get the benefit of that even if you’re buying digitally. From 1 October, anything you download has to be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose and meet the description that’s given. If you download a game and it’s bug-ridden, you can demand a refund and quote the sale of goods act. Before this, it wasn’t especially clear cut.”The act also covers free-to-download games. There is obviously no refund potential on the title itself but virtual goods, such as customised characters or new maps and levels, will be covered by the act and users will be able to demand refunds on unsatisfactory in-game purchases.Early releases and day one disastersThe new ruling also allows for the growing number of titles now released in unfinished or “beta” form, through services like Steam Early Access. “If you do indicate to people that the game is going to be buggy, that is allowed,” says Tutty. “But the act will allow people to get a refund on games that are released as full titles, yet are filled with bugs and don’t work.”So how will this affect those big day one releases, especially multiplayer games, where players want to get online and start levelling up their characters as soon as possible – but find that the code is broken or the servers have collapsed? “There are two remedies under the act,” says Tutty. “The right to repair or replacement, or the right to a price reduction up to a full refund if a repair or replacement is not possible within a reasonable time. So a company could possibly say, ‘well, we’ve got a patch coming that will fix it pretty quickly’. That’s a repair.”“However, where it gets quite interesting is that lots of people really want to play on day one – that’s a key selling point, especially when you get these exclusive deals where a certain map pack may be available first on a specific platform – well, presumably you’ve bought that game because you want to play it online, on day one, against your mates.”Pre-orders have become a contentious area of the games industry, with a greater number of publishers and retailers looking to get players to commit to a purchase before the final release. Tutty believes that the new act may mean that these customers find they have more power to ask for a refund if the final game doesn’t live up to early promises given on the pre-order page.He explains: “If the company says, this is how the game is going to work, and later they pivot and say, actually it will be slightly different, players could complain that, well I bought it under the belief it was going to be something else, so I want a refund.”So could the changes to the consumer act – which only applies in Britain – lead to any significant changes in how major games get released? It’s possible. Although the UK is only one market, games revenue was £4bn last year, making it second only to Germany in the European sector. Britain also boasts a large development community and is home to some of the most highly subscribed, vocal and influential YouTubers. “If I was a games publisher I would be more mindful now of releasing buggy products,” says Tutty. “I think the quality assurance process is really going to have to ramp back up. It should make things better.”In an age where publishers are relying ever more heavily on bug-fixing patches, as well as on post-release downloadable content such as DLC and virtual goods, the relationship with gamers is becoming much clearer – and the responsibilities more rigorously defined. Although it is the supplier, not the game publisher, that will be responsible for providing refunds or replacements, it seems there’s going to be much greater pressure throughout the pipeline – from developer to consumer – to get things right first time.
Can you hear me now? Not if you’re eavesdropping on a Blackphone. Privacy company Silent Circle has released a second version of its signature handheld, a smartphone designed to quell the data scraping and web tracking that’s become such an integral part of the digital economy in the last few years (and whose resultsmight well end up with the NSA, if the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act passes).Silent Circle is the brainchild of the inventor of the modestly named “Pretty Good Privacy” (PGP) encryption, Phil Zimmermann, and former Navy Seal Team Six sniper Mike Janke. In the beginning, Janke said, the Blackphone project was just a way for people working for his security firmSOC, since sold, to call home without having their communications intercepted. With its newer and easier to use model, it’s seeking industry clients in addition to individual security wonks.“I began going around from Silicon Valley to Germany to Spain, and there just wasn’t anything,” Janke said. “I went Nato, I went to the US, to the British governments, and they all said, ‘No, we don’t know of anything,’ and I said, ‘Come on, you’ve got to have some super-secret tech,’ and they said, ‘No, it’s a big problem for us.’”So Janke, who remembered using PGP as a Seal, sought out Zimmermann and went to work. Now, as the new iPhone and Samsung models hit the market, the Switzerland-based company, which runs a heavily modified version of Google’s Android mobile operating system, finally has support from Google.Google didn’t support the initial software build, something that probably helped make the phone more popular, rather than less, with people concerned about NSA backdoors and data leakage. But now the tech giant is trying to break into the business software market, and that’s a sector that Silent Circle, with its subscription-based business model, has its sights set on. (The subscriptions to secure call and messaging apps that come with the Blackphone run out after a year.)The new operating system is “about 20% Lollipop”, said CEO, Bill Conner, referring to the Android version Blackphone currently uses.Google support is a relief to Silent Circle – in the previous version of the phone, users couldn’t download anything from the Google Play store and had to manage installation through web downloads or an old-fashioned hardware connection. The new version lets users download whatever they want and tweak its access to your data as you see fit in much the way the iPhone does – a feature Google-distributed builds of Android have notably avoided over the years.Blackphone is encrypted end to end, if both people on the line are using either the phone itself or Silent Circle’s call and messaging apps. If someone tries to break into a Blackphone call, they’ll get a notification and the call will drop.“But let’s say I have my Blackphone and I left my jacket at a hotel in Paris and they have a big, old landline and I’m calling from New York,” said Janke.“I dial their number and I’m encrypted all the way from New York to the Paris public switch telephone network, and then I’m open to them,” he explained. “It’s either encrypted completely end-to-end, or encrypted to the public switch network and then open from there.”Janke said he still hopes Google will adopt some of Silent Circle’s own features: “We hope that Google will federate some of the capabilities [of our phone],” he said. “They’ve got [support for multiple personas] in Android that’s coming out now. The problem with it is that it still leaves data across those spaces and the spaces aren’t segregated all the way down to the chip.”
RIP the static profile pic. Facebook has reincarnated the highlight/lowlight (depending on your tolerance for flashy things on the internet) of early 2000s’ social media: animated profile pics are back.Such avatars, which became all to common to the MySpace generation through liberal use of animated gifs, have largely been absent in subsequent social networks even as the file format has undergone a resurgence.But Facebook’s new profile videos – several seconds of video which is essentially 2015’s equivalent of an animated gif – can be uploaded from the Facebook iPhone app toannoydelighteveryone.Once recorded and uploaded they’ll only animate if someone visits your profile, not in everyone’s newsfeed – yet.“Profile videos will let [you] show a part of yourself you couldn’t before, and add a new dimension to your profile,” said Facebook ina blog postannouncing the change.Facebook’s new profile videos.Profile photos can also be set as temporary images for certain events, reverting back to your standard pouty smizing face once the World Cup, or whatever else has proved cause for a novelty overlay, has ended.“It can be a visual status update to let your friends know what’s going on in your life today, or it can be your statement of solidarity for a cause you feel strongly about,” said Facebook. Cue painted faces and flags.Both profile photos and videos are now bigger and centred on the page making them harder to ignore.The new profile videos can only be uploaded via the Facebook app for iPhones, and only for users in the UK and California for now. Despite being exclusive to Apple’s iOS at the moment, Apple’s new Live Photos aren’t supported.The Guardian’s Jonathan Haynes illustrates why Facebook’s new video profile pictures may be a terribly bad idea.Facebook profiles also now have a small space just under the action buttons for people to write whatever they like, just like Twitter’s bios. Emojis, words, missives or an actual biography are all welcome, as are up to five featured photos.Anyone who can see your profile on Facebook will be able to see the new bio space. Other information on your profile can be shown or not based on extensive criteria around friends, friends of friends, public and so on.Facebook suffers second outage in a week – and users vent on TwitterFacebook joins YouTube in showing 360-degree videos – including Star WarsFacebook accused of spying on Belgian citizens like the NSA
In life, there are things you just know you shouldn’t do. Never eat the yellow snow. Never trust anyone who is rude to waiters. Never take on one last job before retirement. And, of course, the golden rule: never, ever go on Grand Designs if you don’t really know what you want, where you want it and whether or not you have the budget to build it anyway.Grand Designs is a show in which Kevin McCloud joins a series of couples as their ambitious home-building plans are crushed beneath the caterpillar tracks of fortune. Every single episode follows the same plot. A happy couple describes their perfect house, Kevin raises his eyebrows, then they embark on the project anyway. A year passes – then we see the couple, now a shadow of their former selves, squatting in a concrete house-shell, taking it in turns to wash themselves in a stagnant puddle. For some reason, they always decide to have a baby at this point. Then Kevin says: “I told you so”. This makes for entertaining viewing.I’m talking about Grand Designs for two reasons. The first is because it delivers excellent schadenfreude. The second is that I am reviewing Happy Home Designer, a game in which you design homes for idiots. See the parallels?The basic premise is this: in a world where animals live in houses, you have been chosen to decorate those houses. Unlike Kevin McCloud, you have almost complete creative freedom – but the animals, your clients, ask you to make sure their two or three pieces of furniture are worked into the design somewhere.No problem, right? You start off your career with a spring in your step, as Kevin himself probably did before the years of working with naive middle-class numpties took their toll. “I want a gothic palace,” your clients bleat. “I loooove polka dots.” You take their briefs and create their perfect homes – though with the amount of freedom you’re given, it’s more likeyourideal home, despite the fact you don’t ever get given your own to decorate. Maybe you just live in your car.With the passing of time (and the spending of Play Coins), your responsibilities increase. One day you’ll get to choose wall decorations; the next, you can design the entire garden.It’s a vast improvement on the home designing elements in the otherwise excellent Animal Crossing: New Leaf, with more stuff, more options, more features – and a much better interface for actually positioning the furniture, moving from fiddly sofa-dragging to a simpler top-down grid that allows you to select, drop and rotate with the stylus. It’s so easy, Kirsty Allsopp could do it.Related:Animal Crossing: New Leaf – reviewThere’s a huge selection of furniture at your fingertips, allowing you to create just about anything you can imagine. The tiny room size both limits and hones your creativity – at least at first – and the animals’ requested themes give you direction, so you’re not left floundering. This catalogue is easily the most well-designed bit of Happy Home Designer, even if the menu layout is frustratingly ambiguous.The town design is also at your command, with the help of lovely Isabelle. You’ll start by plonking down shops and restaurants, later moving on to schools and a hospital without ever having to understand or learn what a hospital actually needs in order to keep its patients alive. Just bung in an operating table or two, and trust that the power of whimsy will keep them all going for now.With your input, the town turns from a cartoon recreation of Watford into somewhere you’d want to live. The buildings bustle with simulated life, but it all feels like you’re on the wrong side of the goldfish bowl. You can’t really interact with anything – you can’t shop or drink coffee, and the residents won’t say much more than a sentence to you. It’s then that the cute veneer starts to wear down to reveal the vapidity beneath.Happy Home Designer, a game with a much smaller premise than New Leaf, keeps up a similar rate of progress to its predecessor, but tails off about 10-15 hours in. No fishing, no bug catching, no fossil finding, no real friendships… just home decoration. Sure, that’s implied by the title, but it just ends up feeling like your poor home designer has no life. At this point, you might – like me – start phoning it in.Do you have to use this ugly furniture? Yes. Sorry. What happens if you don’t put anything else in, then? Nothing. They still think you did a great job. Okay, then, what happens if you run completely wild? Well, you could take the “TV studio” brief and turn it into something a little more … adult. No one seems to mind. Or notice.Just like the numpties on Grand Designs, Happy Home Designer doesn’t really know what it wants, and it suffers for it. It can’t possibly be the newest Animal Crossing – it’s far too small. It’s a pretty good, if simple, home decorating game, but not as a full, standalone release. It’s a life simulator that doesn’t let you have a life. If this were an episode of Grand Designs, and I was Kevin McCloud, I’d turn to the camera right now, and say: “Well, it’s not quite what we all wanted, but … I guess it’ll do.” Roll eyes. Roll credits.
In our modern world, where there are online reviews for everything from specific brands of ballpoint pen to specific shades of eyeshadow, buyer’s remorse should be a thing of the past. There are no mistakes; only lack of research.Those who won’t go to a play, buy a new phone, or eat at an unfamiliar restaurant without reading what others had to say about their experience first might be early adopters of Peeple, a user-review site like Yelp – but for human beings.Related:Yelp CEO talks mobile growth, global expansion... and doner kebabsSubtitled “character is destiny”, Peeple is an upcoming app that promises to “revolutionise the way we’re seen in the world through our relationships” by allowing you to assign reviews of one to five stars to everyone you know.“The Peeple app allows us to better choose who we hire, do business with, date, become our neighbours, roommates, landlords/tenants, and teach our children,”runs the blurb. “There are endless reasons as to why we would want this reference check for the people around us.”It is the brainchild of a Canadian marketer, Julia Cordray, and her Californian co-founder, Nicole McCullough, who describe it as a “positivity app for positive people”.The Washington Post reportsthat the company’s shares were valued at US$7.6m on Monday, and that Cordray and McCullough are pitching for more investment. (Many of theshareholders profiledon Peeple’s website have personal relationships with Cordray.)To join the service – which is being beta tested – you must be at least 21 and have an established Facebook account. All reviews you write appear under your real name, and are contextualised in one of three categories: personal, professional or romantic. You can improve your public “positivity rating” by writing more positive reviews than negative ones.To add someone new to the site’s database, you must have their mobile phone number. Positive reviews post immediately; reviews of two stars or fewer are sent to the subject’s private inbox, from which point you have 48 hours to “work it out with the user”: “If you cannot turn a negative into a positive the comment will go live and then you can publicly defend yourself.”Reviews will also expire after a year, to reflect people’s capacity to “grow and change for the better”.How do I opt out pre-emptively?Facebook commentAlthough users can report any write-ups they believe are inaccurate or violate Peeple’s terms and conditions, they cannot delete reviews. If you do not join Peeple, and thus can’t contest those negative ratings, your profile shows only positive ones.It sounds like a moderating – not to mention legal – minefield, and early media stories have been sceptical. (The development of a similar service, MeowMeowBeenz, and the social breakdown that ensues is the plotof one episodeof the sitcom Community.)“I’m really looking forward to being able to air all of my personal grievances, all from the safety of my phone,” wrote columnist Mike Morrison inan opinion piecethat was later rebutted point-by-pointon Peeple’s Facebook page.In an update titled “An Ode to Courage” posted prominently on Peeple’s home page, Cordray and McCullough say they refuse to apologise for being “bold innovators … because we love you enough to give you this gift … whether you love us or our concept or not”.On Thursday Cordray told the Guardian that Peeple had been “misrepresented by media”. When signing up, users must agree to an extensive list of terms and conditions intended to prevent shaming or bullying.These include “profanity, bullying, health references, disability references, confidential information, mentioning other people in a rating that you are not currently writing a rating for, name calling, degrading comments, abuse, derogatory comments, sexual references, mention of confidential information, racism, legal references, hateful content, [and] sexism”.Users are also not allowed to review people they do not know.“We will be reviewing all negative reviews posted before they can go live and will have control over them,” said Cordray. “We will also be reviewing positive reviews to unclaimed profiles to ensure compliance [to the terms and conditions].”But the response to Peeple posted on its Facebook page suggests that, for many, this is not reassurance enough. “How do I opt out pre-emptively?” askedone commenter; a representative responded saying that “we have not made these decisions concrete yet nor have we launched our app”.An editedFacebook post published lateon Wednesday night further suggested that the terms and conditions of the app, and the way it functioned, were not yet set in stone.Currently, users are not allowed to remove themselves from Peeple’s database, but Cordray said this was under consideration: “No promises though as we want to hear from our Beta users and do what they would want since they would likely be our users.”She said Peeple would be launched in November “unless we change major features” – meaning you have at least one month to get into everyone’s good books.
1. Logging out of Facebook remotelyEver checked Facebook on a friend’s or family member’s device and then realised, with horror, that you forgot to log out? Never fear, there’s a simple, but little known, way to log out of your profile remotely. Navigate to “settings” using the drop-down in the right hand corner of your screen, then “security”, then “when you’re logged in”. From this screen, you will be able to close an open session, on whichever device it’s still running on.The Facebook page enabling remote logout.Photograph: Facebook2. Searching incomplete phrases on GoogleWhen trying to remember a particular quote, phrase, proverb or lyric, it’s often the case that we half-remember, missing words or skewing them slightly.A little known Google trick makes it much easier to identify them. Putting an asterisk in a quoted sentence will indicate that a word is missing (replaced with the asterisk). This makes it much more likely that the specific term you are looking for will be returned, rather than results which just happen to include the other words or rest of the sentence.For example: I want to identify the Foals’ songGive It Allby searching for the following lyric: “all that remains are words in the rain”, but let’s say I didn’t quite catch “words” or “rain”. If I were to just search for “all that remains are in the”, I would return search results on a band called All That Remains. If, however, I google “all that remains are * in the *” (including quotation marks),the Foals song will be returned in the results. Clever.3. Twitter soft blockTwitter has a pretty good function in themute button, which allows you to remain following an account but hides its tweets and retweets from your own timeline. It’s a great way of basically ridding a person from your Twitter experiencewithout offending them by unfollowing. (People do not know when you mute them. To mute: click on the cogwheel to the right of somebody’s profile.)This is what it would like if I muted my boss. 😏Photograph: Twitter screengrabHowever what you often really want is to mute someone from reading your tweets. Here there’s an unofficial option that can help, it’s known as “the soft block”. This is a sly means of forcing a person to unfollow you by blocking and immediately unblocking them. Once they are unfollowing, your tweets and retweets will no longer appear in their timeline. The hope is that you are less visible, and so drawing less engagement from this person. It’s a good way to manage stalkers and people who constantly favourite your tweets and slide into your mentions at every opportunity.If someone’s really keen, however, they will probably be manually checking in on your profile and realise, perplexed, that they are no longer following. In this case, blocking – or a polite word – is the only option.I just done my first soft block. These milestones&mdash; Helen (@givesyouHel)September 23, 20154. Incognito windowsIt’s worrying how many people don’t use incognito mode when browsing the internet. For anyone who does the kind of thing like spend seven minutes at work checking out how celebrities from the 1980s have aged, this is a must. Pretty much all major browsers offer incognito or private browsing mode, which means that a user’s previous activity will not be logged and stored in history.This isn’t just, as people assume, for looking at explicit or otherwise embarrassing content, but can prove useful when, for instance, searching for the other half’s birthday present or looking online for support for an issue you’d rather somebody didn’t stumble across in your browser history.Turning browsing history off does not make you anonymous on the internetHere’s how to browse privately using:Chrome,Firefox,SafariandInternet Explorer. ISPs (internet service providers) and sites themselves, however, will know when a site has been visited – so don’t think private browsing makes you anonymous on the internet. It doesn’t. You’d needTorfor that.5. Mute an email threadThere’s not much more annoying than an office email thread or a chain mail you’d wish you’d never opened. Luckily, there is a simple solution to such suffering. Email threads can, blissfully, thank you Lord, be muted. Using Gmail, click on the “more” tab at the top of the email, and then the mute option. In Outlook, the mute function can be found viathe home tab(the feature is called ignore in Outlook). Muted email threads can be unmuted should you ever want to (never) join back in.6. Use emoji on desktop webOf coursesomebody has devised an actual IRL emoji keyboard(well, fourteen actually, to fit all the emoji in, think giant mixing desk), but how do you go about writing emoji quickly and easily on desktop web?Most of us simply copy and paste emoji from sites such asgetemoji.comoriemoji.com, but there is a simpler way for both Mac and Windows users. In any open text field, simply presscommand and control and space togetheron Mac to bring up the emoji characters panel (using OS X 10.8 or later). On Windows computers, go to the task bar &gt; toolbar &gt; touch keyboard, and choose the smiley key. Unfortunately, the trick is onlycompatible with certain browsersaccording to the operating system you are running.What the pop-up emoji panel looks like on a Mac computer.Photograph: LifeHack7.

Play YouTube in slow motionThere are many fun tricks and tips, or easter eggs, to be found on YouTube. For instance, the ability toplay arcade games within viewer, but there is also a trick that is genuinely useful: playing videos in slow motion. It’s easier to spot yourself in the background of a TV vox pop that way. It’s incredibly simple: just hold down the space bar, and the video will start playing at a slower speed, perfect when it comes to grabbing the perfect screenshot of a particular moment (and here’s how to do thaton MacandPC). You’re welcome.9. Twitter shortcutsJust as Photoshoppers know that shortcuts are the cornerstone of productivity, avid tweeters know that shortcuts are your friend. Did you know that pressing “n” will open up a new tweet dialogue box (on native web Twitter)? Or that you can easily favourite a tweet by simply pressing “f”?

Free yourself from distractionsFinally, we all know how damn distracting the internet is. You want to get on with work, but … Gchats … and Twitter … You don’t want to tear the ethernet cable from the computer, because you still need the internet in some capacity.So how to get around this? Luckily, there is software you can use to help.Cold Turkey, for instance, can be downloaded and will prevent a user from visiting sites, but whitelist others. You can even lock certain sites and applications on a timer setting to truly ensure you keep away from Facebook.

Tracking the number of deaths caused by US drone strikes in countries like Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia? There are apps for that. Or rather, there were – until Apple removed them from its app store.Metadata+ was launched in early 2014by Josh Begley, a data artist and research editor for The Intercept. It used data from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to send push notifications to its users whenever someone was killed by a US drone.The app wasrejected five timesunder its original name of Drones+, before Apple approved it as Metadata+. A year and a half on, the app has been removed from the App Store, with Begley telling users the cause was “excessively crude or objectionable content” – referring to a specific clause in Apple’s developer rules.The app used text and maps rather than images of the deaths that it reported, so it could not be considered to be even moderately crude.A screenshot of Begley’s iTunes Connect accountpublished by Gawkermakes it clear that it’s the latter half of the clause that caused the removal. “Your app contains content that many users would find objectionable.”Begley told Gawker that while Metadata+ will continue to work for people who have already installed it, new users will not be able to download it.He runs a Twitter account calledDronestreamthat performs the same role, while his other iOS appEphemeral+also records drone strikes, but was removed by Apple after media coverage of the Metadata+ takedown.Apple had not responded to a request for comment by time of publication.The company has faced scrutiny before about its approach to censorship with apps – from games aboutsweatshops,child-labour,people-trafficking,North Koreaandthe civil war in Syriathrough to its decision in June toremove games from its store that featured the Confederate flag.Apple famously spelled out its beliefs that apps should be treated differently to other forms of media and entertainment, in its App Store rules:“We view Apps different than books or songs, which we do not curate. If you want to criticize a religion, write a book. If you want to describe sex, write a book or a song, or create a medical App.”Apple has shown a willingness to rescind controversial decisions – as in itsu-turn over nudity in the game Papers, Please– but Begley has not said whether he plans to appeal the decision to remove Metadata+ from the App Store.Update: Ephemeral+ has now also been removed by Apple:Hope you downloaded it.

Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, has been put on the spot over the launch of a consultation process being viewed as a crude attempt to curb the explosive growth in London ofUber, the taxi hailing app.Simon Walker, the director general of the Institute of Directors, said that Johnson, together with chancellor George Osborne and business secretary Sajid Javid, should be reducing regulation in the capital’s taxi and private car hire market rather than bringing in new and stiffer rules. Walker was responding to a set of proposals from Transport for London (TfL), revealed on Tuesday, which are said to reflect the mayor’s concerns about traffic congestion in London. Johnson is the chair of TfL.The IoD boss called the measures “heavy-handed” and said they would “damage London’s reputation for innovation”.Walker said: “TfL is right to take an interest in the way companies like Uber have disrupted the way we travel around the capital. But their proposals for further restrictions to an already heavily regulated industry are backwards and would damage London’s reputation as a city which celebrates innovation and embraces change.Related:Transport for London could crack down on Uber in taxi consultation“Boris Johnson, George Osborne and Sajid Javid have set themselves up as passionate advocates of the free market. How they proceed from here is a crucial test of those ideals,” Walker added.Walker’s outburst came as Uber fought back against a possible crackdown on its services with the publication of a petition that was signed by nearly 90,000 Londoners by mid-afternoon.The measures being considered by TfL could include the introduction of an interval of at least five minutes between a booking and the start of a journey.Other proposals involve a requirement for drivers to pass an English language test and a map reading assessment, while firms could have to operate a fixed landline telephone and accept bookings up to seven days in advance.The escalating row over the future of Uber’s service in London took place against the background of further controversies in Europe. Earlier this week, Dutch police raided Uber’s office in Amsterdam as part of a criminal investigation and on Wednesday two executives from the firm appeared in Paris for the start of a trial, facing a range of charges, including some under a law that bans the company’s low-cost Uberpop car-sharing service.In London, TfL chief operating officer for surface transport, Garrett Emmerson, said: “We are launching a public consultation in order to inform and improve the regulations that govern the capital’s private hire trade.”Uber is urging its customers to sign the petition, saying “these rules make no sense”. In a statement on its website, the US-backed company said: “TfL also wants to restrict carpooling, including new services like Uberpool.Related:Black cabs face extinction unless rules change, say London mayor contenders“This enables people going in the same direction to share a car, cutting the cost of the trip as well as congestion on London’s streets.“And the proposed rules threaten drivers’ livelihoods by forcing them to drive for just one operator.”TfL’s proposals are backed by Sadiq Khan, Labour’s candidate to succeed Boris Johnson as the next mayor of London, and by thousands of black cab and minicab drivers. Khan tweeted: “Welcome news of new proposals to regulate taxi and private hire vehicles. We must ensure we protect Londoners and our historic taxi trade.”Johnson and TfL have been viewed as soft onUberover the past three years, during the firm’s explosive growth phase in London. But Johnson has become increasingly concerned about the growth in the number of cabs in London and the congestion they cause.
Tesla Motors has unveiled its new electric sport utility vehicle (SUV), the Model X, withmuch fanfare in California.The debut comes amid growing speculation that low-carbon vehicles are finally on the verge of a breakthrough after the Volkswagen emissions scandal.The Model X has been billed by Tesla and its chief executive,Elon Musk,as the company’s most advanced vehicle to date.The specifications and the look of the Model X will certainly catch the eye of motorists who have become disillusioned by the traditional automotive industry in light ofVW cheating emissions tests on diesel cars.Musk claims the scandal shows the time has come for carmakers to “move to a new generation of technology” or face being wiped out.“What the Volkswagen [scandal] is really showing is that we’ve reached the limit of what’s possible with diesel and gasoline,” he said.However, the launch of the Model X was two years later than scheduled and it will cost consumers up to $144,000 (£95,000).Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk introduces the Model X.Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters“I’m not sure anyone should make this car,” Musk said at the launch. “There’s far more there than is really necessary to sell the car.”The car is the latest step in Musk’s plan to transform the automotive industry, and he has his eyes on developing fully autonomous cars within the next three years.But Tesla, which was founded in 2003, is yet to make a profit and delivered just 31,655 cars in its last financial year. In the UK, just 15,869 ultra low-emission vehicles were registered in 2014, although this was a 264% increase on the previous year.David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston Business School in the Midlands, said electric cars remain a luxury product at present due to their cost.However, he said the emissions crisis could be a“profoundly important moment”in the automotive industry and encourage electric carmakers to step up their investment in research and development.Diesel cars face tighter regulations and greater taxation, Bailey added, and the mayors of leading cities could restrict their movement in favour of low-carbon vehicles.The Model X launch was two years later than scheduled.Photograph: Getty Images“The cost of electric cars has held back the development of a mass market,” Bailey said. “A gamechanger could be the Gigafactory [which will be the biggest battery factory in the world] that Tesla is building.”Apart from its price, the Tesla’s Model X represents a step-up in electric car technology. The electric4x4 can reach 60mph in 3.2 seconds, has a top speed of 155mph and its battery charge lasts for 25o miles.The car is equipped with seven seats, a 43cm touchscreen for controlling driving and entertainment systems, and double-hinged falcon wing doors that can open with just 30cm of space either side of the car.The Model X also includes an array of sensors, including a radar and sonar system that applies the brakes if there is danger of an accident, and doors that open automatically when the driver approaches.With Tesla and a string of other ambitious companies developing electric cars, analysts at Fitch, the credit-rating agency, believe theVW crisis could spark a turning point in the industry.Emmanuel Bulle, senior director of corporates at Fitch, said: “Regulators will reassess the timeline to reach planned more stringent emission limit targets and could review the targets themselves.“The scandal could accelerate the underlying growth of vehicles with alternative powertrains, including fuel cells, electric and hybrid engines.”Other electric car contendersAnalysts anticipate a boom in electric cars amid the fallout from the Volkswagen emissions scandal.Photograph: Clive Gee/PAGoogleThe internet multinational has developed a driverless car with a top speed of 25mph, two seats, and a screen displaying its route. “The intention is that the passenger gets in the vehicle, says into microphone ‘Take me to Safeway’ and the car does the entire journey,” said Sarah Hunter, head of policy at GoogleX, the company’s advanced technology arm.In order to work, the car requires detailed maps with road features such as lanes, roundabouts and traffic lights accurate to within 1cm. Google is manufacturing a “few hundred” of the cars and Californian authorities are working on regulations to pave the way for the operation of driverless vehicles on its roads.ApplePerhaps the rival that the automotive industry fears the most, rumours about Apple building a car have been fuelled by the maker of the iPhone and iPad poaching staff from carmakers.The Apple car is codenamed as Project Titan and the company wants to launch it in 2019, according to recent reports in the US. Apple has held talks with US officials about testing the vehicle, although it is not clear whether the car will be fully autonomous.The firm has been keen on developing a car for a long time. Mickey Drexler, the boss of fashion chain JCrew and a former Apple board member, has said: “Steve Jobs, if he had lived, was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.”WheegoA US company that was spun out of Ruff &amp; Tuff Electric Vehicles, a manufacturer of recreational electric vehicles such as golf carts. Wheego imported car frames from China and fitted them with electric drivetrains and batteries in the US. Its first car, the Wheego Whip, was launched in 2009 and only capable of speeds of up to 35mph and a range of 50 miles.However, the Wheego LiFe, its second vehicle, can reach 65mph and was the third electric car approved for use on US highways after the Tesla Roadster and the Nissan Leaf.BYDBYD is China’s answer to Tesla and has found a powerful ally in Warren Buffett, the veteran investor, who controls a 10% stake in the company. Trading in the company’s shares has been volatile, but its e6 electric car is already used for chauffeur services in London and taxis in the city of Shenzhen in China.It has designed and built London’s first zero-emission double-decker bus, which launches in October, and has become a major manufacturer of rechargeable batteries.
My favourite new feature of iOS 9 is Wi-Fi Assist, a smart new setting – on by default on the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system – which allows the phone to gracefully fall back to cellular data when the Wi-Fi in the area flakes out. Admittedly, the fact that it’s my favourite says as much about the nuts-and-bolts nature of iOS 9 (and my own lack of desire to bother with Siri and Spotlight), but there it is.In my own daily use of the operating system, on both an iPhone 6 and 6S, it’s closed a number of black spots in my daily routine. As I’m leaving work, for instance, my phone stays connected to the Guardian’s wifi network until I’m about 100m down the road, but that connection’s too weak for real use almost immediately.Previously, that meant that streaming media cut out for the couple of minutes it took me to get down the stairs, out the building and down the road, but now my 4G picks up almost immediately. A similar hole has been patched as I leave my house in the morning.All of which is to say that, if you have an iPhone, you shouldn’t necessarily follow press reports that tell you to “change this setting to avoid massive iPhone data bills”.The reports largely cite one negative experience with Wi-Fi Assist,that of the Gizmodo journalist Chris Mills. Mills, who has been using iOS 9 since the beta version was released a few months ago, writes:“Since downloading the iOS 9 beta that introduced Wi-Fi Assist, I’ve used around one-third more data a month (4GB vs my regular-as-clockwork 3GB).“It’s impossible to say if that extra usage is directly related to Wi-Fi Assist, but I have my suspicions. On the iPhone 6s that I’ve only been using for three days, my data usage is at 950MB; half of that is from Netflix, which I make certain to never use when I’m on the go. In fact, the only time I’ve used it in the past couple days was at home, using what I thought was wifi.”Others, including a Guardian colleague, have had a similar experience, with their phones consuming more data since updating to iOS 9.To a certain degree, this is expected: the whole point of Wi-Fi Assist is that the iPhone will start to use mobile data where it wouldn’t have done before. But if you’re sitting in your home watching Netflix, something’s probably gone wrong if your phone falls back to cellular data (although, given some of the homes I have lived in, I’d have killed for something to patch the holes in terrible wifi).At the same time, pre-emptively turning off Wi-Fi Assist will lose you access to one of the best new features of iOS 9 – and one which is fast becoming standard on other devices. Samsung, for instance, offers users “smart network switch”, a similar feature which allows seamless playback of streaming media.If you are on a limited data plan, those features could be the straw that broke the camel’s back. Over-use charges are never pleasant, and if you’re happy with your phone as it is and can’t afford to get more bandwidth from your provider, it may be worth turning it off – after spending a while with it on, and monitoring your mobile usage in the iPhone’s settings.More usefully, setting data-heavy apps such as Netflix to “wifi only” (in this case, found in the iPhone’s settings app) will let you keep your usage low while still benefiting from the feature in daily life.But if you’ve got slack in your allowances, or are on an unlimited data package from a provider such as Three (and you should be on an unlimited data package, it’s 2015), leave Wi-Fi Assist on.Predictably, the setting has been picked up as the whipping boy of the new operating system. Give it a few more days, and we’ll be hearing about “wifiassistgate”, and people will be demanding an apology from Apple. But, as ever, there’s a certain amount of feedback in the hype cycle, leading to people who otherwise wouldn’t have had an issue blaming Wi-Fi Assist for all their problems.One user posted on the Apple support forumsasking how to turn off Wi-Fi Assiston their iPhone 4S, blaming it for making their phone be “super slow, glitchy, and losing battery fast”. A few posts later, they got their answer: Wi-Fi Assist isn’t actually on the iPhone 4S.So before you blame the latest bugbear for your issues, give it a go. It’s not as bad as all that.
“Algorithms can’t do it alone. They’re very handy, and you can’t do something of this scale without ‘em, but you need a strong human element.”That’s Apple’s Jimmy Iovine,talking to the Guardian in Juneahead of the launch ofApple Music, the company’s new music-streaming service. The same interview saw him label rivals like Spotify as mere “utilities” lacking Apple’s human touch.Three months on, Apple Music’s earliest adopters are nearing the end of its three-month free trial, and must decide whether its blend of algorithms and people is worth paying for.Their decision will be based on a service that does some things well, but – asApple itself has admitted– needs improvement in other areas.Basic detailsApple Music is available for PC and Mac as part of the iTunes software, and for iOS devices within their preloaded Music app. An Android version will follow later this year.Like rival services, the core of Apple Music is a catalogue of recordings – 30m songs – to stream “on demand”, with recommendations, themed playlists and radio-like stations to help people navigate it. Here, there’s also a live radio station, Beats 1, and a social section called Connect.For the most part, the catalogue is the same as those of its rivals. Apple does have Taylor Swift’s latest album 1989 as a streaming exclusive, while new releases from Dr Dre and Drake/Future have debuted on Apple Music a week or two before appearing on other streaming services.A membership – Apple is avoiding the word “subscription” – costs £9.99 a month for one person, or £14.99 for a family plan covering up to six people. Some elements, including Beats 1, are available for free to non-members who sign in with an Apple ID.Apple Music’s New section.Exploring the musicYou can search for albums and songs on Apple Music to play, as well as adding them to your own playlists and downloading them for offline access. Like its rivals, it also recommends you old and new music that it thinks you’ll like.These recommendations are found in two sections of the app: New and For You. New is where you’ll find new tracks and albums, popular playlists, music videos and other promotional suggestions – for example, in September, links to artists playing that month’s Apple Music Festival.Related:Apple Music interview: 'Algorithms can't do it alone – you need a human touch'New is also the way in to the playlists being compiled by Apple’s in-house team and guest curators. It’s one of Apple Music’s strongest features: a deep selection of playlists that mines plenty of interesting niches.In one day exploring, I flitted between Resident Advisor’s guide to Ninja Tune; Pitchfork’s Early ‘80s Disco playlist; a Northern Soul collection; a selection of hip-hop tracks sampling Booker T &amp; the MGs; and playlists exploring the influences on Chvrches, Nirvana and My Bloody Valentine.Apple Music also has a group of “The A-List” playlists covering pop, dance, alternative, hip-hop, rock, R&amp;B, electronic and new artists, which offer a good selection of what’s bubbling up on the service.The obvious comparison is to Spotify, which also has a large selection of playlists compiled in-house. Apple’s tend to be shorter with 12-20 tracks at a time, while Spotify’s tend to be longer at 80 tracks or more: better suited for playing on shuffle. Both approaches can work well, though.Bar the odd tone-deaf moment – a penny for St. Vincent or Sleater-Kinney’s thoughts on topping a “Girls with Guitars” playlist – Apple’s playlist curation is a strong point, although its rivals are far from the characterless utilities that Apple paints them as on this front.Algorithms at workThe For You feature is where Apple’s algorithms come in to play, providing a feed of suggestions for playlists and albums based on your iTunes music collection and Apple Music listening habits. The more you use it, the better the recommendations should become – in theory.Three months in, it’s too early to provide a definitive verdict on this, especially as in my case Apple Music was challenged from the start: I’ve been a paying Spotify user since 2008, so Apple knows very little about my music life over the past seven years, apart from that I bought the last Beyoncé and Taylor Swift albums (which weren’t on Spotify).Related:Spotify has six years of my music data, but does it understand my tastes?Unsurprisingly, my early days of For You were driven by this: lots of Britpop, mid-90s dance and singer-songwriter recommendations based on my pre-2008 iTunes collection, and the odd “Workout like Beyoncé” playlist – which sounds inappropriate, but as a bangers-not-ballads collection of Bey and Destiny’s Child tracks is actually marvellous.Spotify, by contrast, knows what I’ve been listening to in the last seven years: its “Discover” section is currently recommending me albums similar to Disclosure, Best Coast, Courtney Barnett, Django Django and Jamie Woon among others. Meanwhile, its excellent Discover Weekly playlist throws a new batch of new artists and songs at me every week.Somewhere between these two poles lies a full picture of the musical me. As things stand, Spotify is better at recommending me new artists, while Apple Music is better for bathing in the warm, neon-gloved glow of Best of ‘90s Indie-Dance, Vol. 2.Even so, Apple Music’s algorithms are learning fast: later in the three-month trial, one day’s recommendations included introductions to Hot Chip, Laura Marling and Orbital as well as albums by Primal Scream, Saint Etienne, Django Django, Jungle, Sharon Van Etten and the Chemical Brothers. An encouraging start.Apple Music’s For You feature.Radio rocks?Radio is a big part of Apple Music, including live Beats 1 and the themed collection of “stations” – rock, pop, hip-hop etc – which aren’t quite as specific as playlists, but may work if you just want something on in the background.Beats 1 is a big deal for Apple Music, broadcasting live to the world for 12 hours a day, then repeating that run of shows for the following 12 hours, with a mixture of professional DJs and guest artists with their own shows.Related:What happens when you listen to Beats 1 radio for 24 hours? Lots and lots of DrakeBeats 1 will feel familiar to anyone who’s listened to the BBC’s specialist radio shows and stations in the UK: no wonder given that Apple poached several of the Beeb’s producers as well as Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe.The focus is squarely on new music, which won’t appeal to everyone, although with iOS devices now owned by a broad section of the population, there’s clearly scope for a Beats 2 for older and/or more mainstream music fans in the future.Beats 1 is good, with artist-run shows from the likes of St Vincent, Josh Homme, Q-Tip and Elton John reminding me (in a good way) of why the likes of Iggy Pop, Cerys Matthews, Jarvis Cocker, Guy Garvey and Huey Morgan have helped the BBC’s 6Music build such a strong character.Lowe’s enthusiasm for new music remains infectious, and colleagueJulie Adenugais a real breath of fresh airwaves too. Beats 1’s weakness at launch was its lack of archived shows for time-shifted listening, but that’s since been sorted: shows can be searched for within Apple Music, and are posted on DJs’ Connect profiles.Failing to ConnectIf Beats 1 is a strength for Apple Music, the Connect section is a big disappointment. It was pitched as part Twitter, part Instagram and part SoundCloud: a place for artists, DJs and tastemakers to post status updates, photos, videos and even full songs.As a fan, you follow your favourites to get a feed of their posts, which you can comment on. Apple saw it as a special club for exclusive tracks, raw lyrics and behind-the-scenes insights beyond those available on other social networks. For now, few artists are delivering on that promise.Related:Apple admits it has 'homework to do' to improve Apple MusicIn fact, many notable musicians are posting barely once a week, with many of those updates either reposted photos from Instagram and Twitter; exhortations to buy tickets, stream or buy albums; or tune in to Beats 1 shows.Connect isn’t offering anything you can’t get from Twitter and Facebook, and while Apple is promoting songs and videos “discovered on Connect” within Apple Music, it’s nowhere near as vibrant a pool of new and unsigned music as, say, SoundCloud.Apple Music also reinforces the familiar criticism that Apple doesn’tgetsocial. There’s no sense of what your friends are listening to, unlike Spotify with its live ticker of their plays, and its chart of your friends’ top tracks.Apple Music’s system for creating and sharing your own playlists with friends also lags behind: the sense is of a top-down approach, Apple’s editors and its media partners are the curators, and you’re the listener.This will suit plenty of people just fine, but if you cherish the moments where a friend says “I’ve never heard of [band X]” and five minutes of dragging-and-dropping later you’re pinging them a personalised playlist... it’s still possible on Apple Music, but it could be easier.Two snapshots from my Connect feed: promotion and reposted updates.Interface and iCloud issuesIf you’re switching from another streaming music service like Spotify or Rdio, being hurled back into daily usage of iTunes on the desktop or the iOS Music App can be a jarring experience.If you’re already using either or both of those, you’ll face less of a culture shock, and in fairness the more I used it, the less I found myself grimacing at the user interface.More troubling were the anguished howls in the early days of Apple Music from some users with large iTunes music libraries, who’d seenportions of their collections deleted without warning. Other complaints have focused on problems adding albums to local libraries, and keeping that synchronised between devices.My iTunes library appears to be intact, although it’s hard to say for sure since it’s been gathering digital dust since 2008.One of Apple Music’s key strengths should be the way it brings your MP3 collection together with the wider streaming catalogue, so it’s baffling that such a major – for those affected – bug was allowed to slip through the pre-launch checks.Apple has since patched the error, but if you’ve yet to try Apple Music and are concerned, back your library up before signing up. A sensible move regardless of any specific bug.So, is Apple Music worth paying for?As with Spotify, Deezer, Google Play All Access and other streaming services, £9.99 a month for unlimited access to 30m tracks is good value for any music lover.Apple Music’s family plan is particularly good value, whether you’re a parent wanting to keep your kids off torrent sites, or living with housemates. While some rivals have family plans already, they tend to be more expensive: £9.99 for the first person then £4.99 for each additional family member. Google Play has become the first to match Apple’s family-plan price, though, and other rivals will surely follow.Related:How much do musicians really make from Spotify, iTunes and YouTube?Is Apple Music worth £9.99 a month more than its rivals are? My main reason not to move over from Spotify is less about features, and more about data – the data Spotify holds on my music habits, and how it uses that data for recommendations, whether in the Discover Weekly playlist or the “Now” feature that recommends music based on your habits at the current time of day.That, plus the prospect of rebuilding my own playlists (not to mention giving up Discover Weekly and the dozen-or-so trusted playlists that I follow from other people) is what will keep me with that service for the time being.The people most willing to pay for a music-streaming subscription may be the toughest for Apple to sign up, then. But we’re in the minority: 20 million Spotify subscribers plus six million on Deezer, three million on Rhapsody/Napster and an unknown number paying for Rdio, Tidal and other rivals. There are hundreds of millions more people streaming music for free on services like YouTube, SoundCloud and Spotify’s free tier.So if you’re looking for a paid streaming service, Apple Musicisworth paying for. But if you’re happy getting your music for free, you’ll probably want to save yourself £9.99 a month. Apple’s challenge is to change your mind, and while it’s made an encouraging start, there is more work to do.Oh, and one more thing … if you’re a trial member it’s worth noting, the New York Post claims thataround half of the 15 million trial members of Apple Music haven’t turned off its auto-pay option.

Elon Musk’s all-electric-car company Tesla has launched its highly anticipated SUV, the Model X.The seven-seater car has falcon doors that open upwards instead of outwards, can drive 250 miles per charge and will hit 60mph from a standing start in 3.2 seconds with a top speed of 155mph.The Model X is Tesla’s most advanced car yet, with a range of sensors including cameras, radar and sonar systems enabling partial self-driving and automatic braking safety features that can even work at high speeds.Tesla claims its double-hinged falcon wing doors can open with only 30cm of space either side of the car and have sensors to detect objects and people and avoid hitting them when opening or closing.Elon Musk demonstrating the new Model X falcon doors.Photograph: Stephen Lam/ReutersIt also features a large 17in touchscreen for controlling in-car and driving systems, all-wheel drive and an air filtration system that Musk says can protect customers from a biological attack with a “bioweapon defence mode”.The Model X is the third Tesla car to be launched since the company’s inception in 2003. The first was theTesla Roadster, an electric sports car based on a Lotus Elise launched in 2007.Thepopular Model S saloon car, on which the Model X is based, was launched in 2012 and had sold 75,000 vehicles by June this year.The Model X was originally unveiled in 2012, but engineering delays forced the car’s initial 2014 launch plan back to this year.Cars ordered now will still take 8 to 12 months to deliver to customers in the US. A European launch is anticipated at a later date.Elon Musk claims that the Model X’s air filtration system is capable of keeping occupants safe from biological weapons with a new “bioweapon defence mode”.Photograph: Stephen Lam/ReutersThe Model X is an important step in the evolution of the electric car. The SUV and crossover market is expanding, with models such as the Nissan Qashqai placed fifth in the UK with around 40,000 new registrations in 2015 already, according to data from Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.The Model X costs $130,000 in the US – the Model S starts at just under £50,000 in the UK – but Musk says that Tesla hopes to launch its Model 3 “electric car for the people” costing $35,000 in 2017.Tesla Model S car review
Facebook is not planning to make its users pay £5.99 [or $5.99 for US users] to keep their status updates private. Is this news? It may be to the people who’ve been sharing a hoax claiming the opposite.“Now it’s official! It has been published in the media. Facebook has just released the entry price: £5.99 to keep the subscription of your status to be set to ‘private’. If you paste this message on your page, it will be offered free,” claims the widely-circulated chain message.“If not tomorrow, all your posts can become public. Even the messages that have been deleted or the photos not allowed. After all, it does not cost anything for a simple copy and paste.”It also does not cost anything for a simple search on Google or myth-busting websiteSnopesto prove that this is a hoax, thankfully.In fact,according to the latter site, this particular hoax has been circulating since 2009 in various forms. At least this time round, it is not accompanied by a link that attempts to install malware on your computer.Facebook’s privacy settings remain unaltered, with posts and accounts able to be kept private by using the drop-down menu while publishing them, or the general-settings menu.The social network remains a target for hoaxes of this kind, with its sharing options – copy and pasting included – capable of helping them to spread rapidly.Facebook is trying to combat this. In January 2015 the company announced that it wastweaking its news-feed algorithm to crack down on false and misleading stories.“Today’s update to News Feed reduces the distribution of posts that people have reported as hoaxes and adds an annotation to posts that have received many of these types of reports to warn others on Facebook,” explained software engineer Erich Owens and research scientist Udi Weinsberg at the time.The fact that the £5.99 privacy hoax is being copied and pasted rather than spreading through the “share” button may be helping it to avoid those measures.
Video and music tend to hog the headlines around the subject of casting technology, but with its new Chromecast, Google is making a play in another area: games.Gaming, once dominated by specialist companies, is increasingly becoming a battleground for the tech giants.Google’s rival Apple recently focused on games as a key selling point of its updated Apple TV. That device can download and run games, spurring talk of it competing with established games consoles such as Sony’s PlayStation 4, Microsoft’s Xbox One and Nintendo’s Wii U.Now Google’s making playing games on smartphones but viewing them on TV’s a feature of its Chromecast, using your phone both as a controller and for its processing power.Google’s vice president of Chromecast, Mario Queiroz, argues this gives it a key advantage over the likes of Apple TV.“There’s a fundamental difference between the other models out there and what we’re doing. Games require computing power, and the smartphone has superior computing power to any of the popular streaming boxes that are out there. It may be one or two generations more computing power,” he told the Guardian.Related:Five of the best media-streaming boxes to turn your dumb TV into a smart one“By running the game on the smartphone, you’re taking advantage of much more powerful computing power than you are by downloading a game on to a streaming box and running it on that device,” he said.“Our model gives us a huge advantage in being able to run games and render much higher quality graphics. And we are seeing a lot of takeup by game developers of our APIs, including those that allow them to build multiplayer games. Something we think will be very popular with the Cast model.”Google launched the first Chromecast in July 2013 as a thumb-sized device that plugged into a television. By May 2015,the company had sold 17m of them, and accumulated a library of thousands of Android and iOS apps supporting its “cast” technology.It is hoping to build on this with the second-generation Chromecast, as well as with the Chromecast Audio, which will connect to speakers and hi-fis to enable them to play music from partner services, from the company’s own Google Play Music to partners like Pandora and, a new addition, Spotify.It’s far from the first gadget to do this, from the connected hi-fis of Sonos and other manufacturers to cheaper devices like the Gramofon, which also has a close relationship with Spotify, and which looks like the most direct rival for Chromecast Audio.Queiroz hopes that the latter device’s price at $35 will help connected audio in the home break out of being a technology for music and/or tech geeks, without requiring people to replace their hi-fis. “Fewer than 5% of US households have speakers that can connect to Wi-Fi,” he said.Can Google reach a decent number of the remaining 95%, and take this technology mainstream? “I think we will. That’s our objective. The pieces of this that are new – that can bring it mainstream – are firstly the apps that people already use to listen to music on their smartphones,” he said.“Second, they already have speakers and wifi in their homes. And now for $35, you are bringing all of that together.”Chromecast Audio expands Google’s Cast technology to speakers.Gustav Soderstrom, vice president of product at Spotify, suggested that devices like the Chromecast family can also bring bigger tech-industry concepts to a more mainstream audience.“If you think about last year’s big focus on the internet of things, people kept talking about connected fire alarms and similar devices. But the obvious thing is to get your music playing with those connected features. That’s the most natural entry point to the internet of things,” he said.“This $35 device may be the thing that takes it from ‘I’m a fan of the internet of things’ – which unfortunately not a lot of people are – to ‘I want music in my home’ which is a real use case. Most people don’t care if their thermostat talks to their fire extinguisher, even if I care about that quite a bit, because I’m a geek!”Soderstrom added that Spotify is excited about the amount of experimentation going on around music in the home, and not just for hardware.“There is a lot of experimentation about what the perfect interface is: is it a piece of glass, is it your voice, is it dedicated hardware? Amazon is experimenting with voice-only with its Echo, for example,” he said. “You see different companies taking different approaches.”The software and services running on these products are interesting because, in many cases, they will be interfacing with multiple people rather than a single owner. Google’s Queiroz said his company is looking to app developers to think about collaborative use cases.Related:Spotify has six years of my music data, but does it understand my tastes?“For multiplayer games, your smartphone is your controller,” he said, before citing an API launched by Google this year that will enable developers to add “joint queues” for their cast-enabled apps.“It’s something we’ve had from the very first day we launched YouTube for Chromecast: you can create playlists that everybody can contribute to: they go into the YouTube app and add to a joint queue across multiple people,” he said.Spotify, too, is thinking about the communal experience, and how to best fit it into the company’s mobile app, which is becoming ever more personalised to the individual owner of the smartphone it’s installed on.It will provide a design challenge for Spotify, but Soderstrom said the company is keen for its mobile app to rise to the task of understanding when a user is playing music at home – whether through a PlayStation 4, a Sonos hi-fi or a speaker with a Chromecast Audio attached – and adapting accordingly.“When you come home, with Connect, your speakers pop up and become available, so it understands your context in that sense, and that applies whether you’re on the train, in the home, in the car,” said Soderstrom. “It should be able to adapt to the situation you’re in.”•Sonos keen to support Apple Music alongside Spotify
Uber has welcomed the introduction of regulations for ride-sharing services in the Australian Capital Territory, saying the new rules simply underpin its existing annual driver background checks and vehicle inspections.Related:NRMA urges governments to regulate Uber and other ride-sharing services“Our checks are actually of a higher standard than the taxi industry and they are backed up by a rating system that drivers must maintain if they are to be kept on the system,” said David Rohrsheim, general manager of Uber Australia.“We won’t put cabs out of business. A cab is still the best way to get from A to B if you’re on George Street in Sydney. We just make better use of the cars that are out there ... There is a top-down mood for change in Australia.”Canberra will become the first place in Australia to allow the legal, regulated use of Uberand other ride-sharing services from October.The ACT government said it would allow services such as Uber to enter Canberra from 30 October to offer “safe, flexible and affordable” journeys to people.Ride-sharing vehicles will undergo accreditation and registration, including criminal and driving history checks, similar to taxi drivers.The ACT minister for transport reform, Shane Rattenbury, said the move would put pressure on Canberra taxi drivers, many of whom staged a three-hour strike earlier this month to protest against Uber’s imminent arrival.The ACT government will slash taxi licence fees from $20,000 to $10,000 from 30 October, with a further $5000 cut next year.A new transport booking service will replace the existing taxi network, allowing accredited drivers to carry passengers via Uber if they meet certain standards, such as being alcohol and drug free.“Public transport is an integral part of any city,” Rattenbury said. “These reforms are a win for Canberrans and those travelling to the territory, improving access to diverse transport options and competitive pricing.”Uber is an app-based service that allows customers to connect with nearby drivers via GPS and pay them, via the app, for their trip. The budget UberX and more expensive UberBlack versions are available in Australia, with about 1 million people signed up to the service.Senator David Leyonhjelm said he hoped MPs would now be able to use Uber more easily. Politicians are given Cabcharge dockets that can be used only in traditional taxis.“I use Uber from time to time, though not much because I usually conduct my business on my motorbike,” Leyonhjelm told Guardian Australia.“I’m an enthusiastic supporter of Uber. It’s a great example of using modern technology: it lowers costs and it gives consumers options. Using it for parliamentary work is hard because claiming it back is tedious and it’s easier to use a Cabcharge for a taxi.”Uber, which launched in the US in 2009, is available in 60 countries and has established regulated arrangements in about 50 jurisdictions around the world.But it is banned in some countries, such as Spain, and cities, including Berlin and Rio de Janeiro.Related:Uber taxi service banned in Berlin on safety groundsThe Canberra Taxi Industry Association did not respond to a request for comment. However, on its website the association described Uber’s claim that its drivers are vetted through rigorous safety checks as being “proven globally to be fatally flawed with many criminals becoming approved Uber drivers”.It also stated that the recent strike was arranged by drivers “concerned about the arrival of a multinational company threatening their financial viability and livelihood”.Rohrsheim said the only reason some people thought the service was unsafe was “a massive fear campaign – billboards that say Uber is no safer than hitchhiking. Choice [the consumer advocacy group]put out a reportwhich completely debunked that,” he said.Other Australian states and territories have undertaken reviews of ride-sharing services. Victoria, which has completed its review, is expected to be the next jurisdiction to decide whether to allow the regulated use of Uber.

Tim Cook has told a conference of business executives that American corporations have a responsibility to help improve equality, the environment and public education because of a lack of government progress in the past few decades.Speaking at the BoxWorks conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Cook insisted his position was not partisan but that equality should not still be an issue in 2015.“To give people a basic level of dignity and human rights over 200 years after we said all men are created equal … this is something we’re going to continue to evangelise about because it’s shocking to me that in 2015 we are even having to discuss this subject. There’s no cost to equality. It’s free,” said Cook.“Business has an important responsibility to society and that has grown markedly in the last couple of decades as government has found it more difficult to move forward and get as much done. That is not making a partisan statement … but I’m a product of public education and too many kids in public schools that aren’t good enough. They’re in essence born with a built-in headwind and things aren’t equal.”Research published in June by the bipartisan advocacy group First Focus found that the US government has consistently decreased spending on education, falling from 1.27% of overall spending in 2011 to just over 1% in 2015. Despite limited increases in some areas, the organisation found that overall education spending had been reduced by 19.8% over those four years.Cook went on to say that climate change needs to be taken seriously. He said Apple’s data centres run on 100% renewable energy and that almost 90% of its supply chain now uses renewable energy too. “In some areas I don’t want anyone to copy us but in this one, I want everybody to copy us.”Cook was talking to Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box, which provides cloud storage for businesses. Cook heavily pushed Apple’s strategy of expanding their products to businesses, saying Apple, which currently has a market capitalisation of $631bn, needed partnerships with IBM, Cisco and Box to diversify into specialist business markets, such as financial services.He said there hadn’t been enough innovation in mobile services for business, with most limited to email and browsing, and took the opportunity to take a swipe at Google, Apple’s most ferocious competitor. “We don’t believe in having one operating system for desktop and mobile – we think it subtracts from both and you don’t get the best experience,” he said referencing Android, Google’s ubiquitous operating system.When talking about partnering with Microsoft, a traditional rival, to introduce its Office software into iOS devices, Cook changed tack. Microsoft made a surprise appearance at an Apple event earlier this month, demonstrating their Office apps for iOS devices. “I’m not a believer in holding grudges – life is short, and you’re going to die soon. You want to have as many friends as you can have and if you can serve someone else better by partnering then you should do it.”Levie, wearing bright blue socks with white clouds combined with blue and orange sneakers, asked where Apple could go from here. “Maybe an airplane? Are you building a plane?”Cook – in black socks and black brogues – said: “No. There’s no iPlane. Maybe one needs to exist. But that’s not something we’re even thinking about.”Speaking to a crowd of sympathetic tech industry executives, Cook simultaneously played down Apple’s success while demonstrating the company’s dominance, asking the audience how many of them used an iPhone (several hundred) and how many used a Blackberry (two).“Our goal was never to be the biggest – we’ve never worried about selling the most. We just always wanted to be the best. We have always believed deeply that if we made the best, some people would want to buy it, and they would use it, and we would have a reasonable business. That strategy has worked for Apple since Steve [Jobs, former CEO] came back in ’97, and we’re still doing that.”
Edward Snowden may soon havemore space to write: Twitter is considering allowing its posts to stretch beyond 140 characters, according to a report citing unnamed sourceson tech news website Re/code.Twitter has struggled with flattening growth and is still in the midst of a search for a new CEO, with co-founder Jack Dorsey running the company in the interim.Related:Facebook working on 'dislike button', Zuckerberg saysDorsey has been voluble about his perception of a need for change at Twitter and on the company’s most recent earnings call was frank about his disappointment with the status quo.Other reports have speculated that Twitter will allow features making it easier to “tweetstorm,” or send multiple numbered tweets as a timeline-filling mini-essay in the manner of popular Twitter users like tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen and New Republic editor Jeet Heer.A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment.Heersaid on Twitterthat he didn’t like the idea of longer tweets.Since people are asking, I will state for the record I oppose twitter&#39;s move to go beyond 140 characters. The limit is a good thing.&mdash; Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet)September 29, 2015“Product initiatives we’ve mentioned in previous earnings calls, like instant timelines and logged-out experiences, have not yet had meaningful impact on growing our audience or participation,” Dorsey told investors on the company’s most recent earnings call. “This is unacceptable and we’re not happy about it.”Twitter most recently reported having 316m monthly active users – about one-fifth of Facebook’s user count – and it is looking for ways to increase that number, though it has had a great deal of success with advertising and monetization of its existing user base.Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research said the company was overperforming by any reasonable metric except its own. “Show me another business growing at 70% year over year,” he said. “The problem is one of expectations. They’re one of the top sellers of digital advertising on the planet.”The company’s stock hasrocked back and forthoverthe last year, largely due to fluctuating guidance from Twitter’s own executives.But it would be wrong to paint Twitter as the only social media company planning major changes to its user experience: Facebook is rumored to be trying out a “dislike” button (actually, the safest locution for it is probably “buttons other than ‘like’,” given that Mark Zuckerbergwasn’t clearon what exactly his product team was testing when he broke the news earlier in September), and Instagram will soon have video ads that are 30 seconds long.Dorsey is indeed the impetus for the change (which may not happen), an unnamed Twitter employee told Re/code: “Having Jack come in and say it’s OK makes all the difference in the world.”
Uber, the taxi-hailing app that is taking on traditional cab drivers around the world, faces the prospect of a severe crackdown in London under proposals from the capital’s transport authority.Transport for London is launching a consultation that includes measures such as forcing operators to provide booking confirmation details to the passenger at least five minutes before a journey starts. However, Uber picks up passengers three minutes after they request a car on average.“We are launching a public consultation in order to inform and improve the regulations that govern the capital’s private hire trade,” said Garrett Emmerson, chief operating officer for surface transport at TfL.TfL, which is overseen by London mayor Boris Johnson, has in the past been seen by rivals as being too soft on California-based Uber.Boris Johnson’s ‘luddite’ insult provokes taxi drivers – video“In recent years the private hire industry has grown exponentially and technology has also developed rapidly,” Emmerson said.“The consultation sets out a number of ways that standards across the industry could be raised, ensuring Londoners can continue to benefit from the service provided by licensed private hire vehicles. No final decisions have been made and we’re keen to hear a range of views from the trade and from Londoners, too.”Having taken a relaxed view on the growth of Uber at the outset, in recent months TfL has become increasingly worried by the growth in traffic on the roads of London and has decided to consult on new proposals for private hire companies. Some of these proposals would ban or restrict a proportion of Uber’s key features.Draft proposals include making operators offer a facility to pre-book up to seven days in advance. Uber currently offers a pre-booking service only minutes before a journey.Related:We live in an age of disruption. I’d rather be creative | Tom HodgkinsonAnother proposal would force drivers to work for one operator at a time. Many of Uber’s drivers are part-time workers. There is also a draft proposal that would place restrictions on ride sharing, which allows several customers to share a car and could threaten Uber’s plans to introduce its UberPool service in London.Uber immediately hit out at the plans. “These bureaucratic new rules will not improve your ride,” said Jo Bertram, Uber’s UK head.“They’re designed to address the concerns of black cab drivers, who feel under pressure from increased competition. But the answer is to reduce the onerous regulations cabbies face today – not increase them for everyone else.”Mike Galvin, head of regulatory affairs forAddison Lee, the largest private hire company in the UK, said TfL’s move came after a period in which legislation had been dropped to accommodate Uber. “They’re using the consultation to reinstate legislation that we worked under for years.”
A recent billboard campaign by the Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) encouraging users of dating apps Tinder and Grindr to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases has led to backlash from the two companies.Related:Popularity of 'hookup apps' blamed for surge in sexually transmitted infectionsTinder sent aletterto the foundation demanding it remove all references to the hookup app from their billboards and that it cease making “false and disparaging statements against Tinder”; according to the AHF, Grindr halted the foundation’s paid advertising for its free STD testing services on their site.“They’re tone deaf,” Michael Weinstein, president of AHF, told the Guardian. “It would have been much wiser for them to say that they’re concerned about their customers and look forward to working with us to help people get the checkups that they need. This would not have been the global story that it has become if they had not responded that way.”In an emailed statement, a Grindr spokesperson said that they have “always been concerned with the issues of men’s health” and with keeping “users informed and aware of health issues”.They added: “We were surprised at the approach the AHF took, and paused the campaign in order to speak with them and assess our relationship. In the end, we’re all on the same page regarding this issue, as health and wellness concerns us all.”The ads, which suggest that users of the apps are at risk for diseases like chlamydia and gonorrhea, show the silhouettes of two couples leaning in. Tinder and Grindr are plastered across two of their faces in large pink letters, while the remaining two silhouettes have the names of STDs on their profiles. To the right of the couples, a website for free STD testing is listed.“There are consequences to hooking up,” Weinstein told the Guardian. “That’s not a moralistic judgement. It’s just a fact and minimizing that is important.”Currently, there are 12 billboards up in Los Angeles and 45 bus bench ads. According to the AHF, they plan to expand the campaign to New York and south Florida.One of the billboards is only a few blocks from Tinder’s Beverly Boulevard headquarters, according to CBS affiliateKCAL9TV. Tinder sent a cease and desist letter to the healthcare foundation on 18 September.“These unprovoked and wholly unsubstantiated accusations are made to irreparably damage Tinder’s reputation in an attempt to encourage others to take an HIV test offered by your organization,” the letter read. “While Tinder strongly supports such testing, the Billboard’s statements are not founded upon any scientific evidence, and are incapable of withstanding critical analysis.”The foundationrespondedjust under a week later to deny Tinder’s request, saying it had “not made any false or disparaging statements against Tinder”. The organization cited an article in Vanity Fair titledTinder and the Dawn of the “Dating Apocalypsethat explores the role dating apps play in “encouraging casual sex among young adults” and a report released bythe Rhode Island Department of Healthin May thatcredited the rise in syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIVbetween 2013 and 2014 to high-risk behaviors like “using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters”.They added: “Rather than trying to chill AHF’s public health message by threatening AHF with frivolous lawsuits, AHF urges Tinder to support its message of sexual health awareness by encouraging Tinder users to get tested for STIs and to get treated promptly if they have an infection.”Tinder did not respond to requests for comment.
Google is making its own Android tablet called the Pixel C, its second wholly Google-made machine after theChromebook Pixel.The 10in Pixel C will have a high resolution screen, a metal body, and will resemble the Chromebook Pixel with a multi-coloured bar light on the back.The tablet will also have a keyboard accessory that docks with the tablet and holds it like a laptop.The Pixel C closed like a notebook.Photograph: GoogleThe Pixel C has a USB-C port for charging – the same one used on theChromebook Pixeland Google’s latest Nexus smartphones – but is not designed to replace Chromebooks, according to Google.Nexus tablets dead?The new tablet, briefly shown off at Google’s Nexus and Chromecast launch event in San Francisco, marks a departure from the partner-based model used by Google before with its Nexus tablets.The first Nexus tablet, the Nexus 7, was launched in 2012 and made by Asus. It followed the model established by the first Nexus smartphone made by HTC in 2010, where Google partnered with a manufacturer to produce a device with a pure Android experience without the manufacturer’s standard customisations.Google partnered with HTC last year to producethe Nexus 9 tablet, but the device suffered from manufacturing defects and overheating issues. It appears Google is replacing the Nexus tablet line with devices made wholly in-house.An Android laptop by any other name.Photograph: GoogleThe search company uses both its Nexus and Pixel device lines to show what its platforms can do, attempting to entice developers to create apps for those platforms.In this case the Pixel C is the new flagship Android Marshmallow tablet experience, which Google obviously thinks should be based at least partially around productivity in the new hybrid laptop-tablet category, started by Microsoft’s original Surface tablet in 2012.Apple recentlyannounced the iPad Prowith a larger screen and similar keyboard accessory available in November. The new devices will pit both Google and Apple in direct competition with Microsoft.The Pixel C will be available with either 32GB of storage for $499 (£330) or 64GB for $599 (£396) and is expected to be available before Christmas. The keyboard will cost $149 (£98).•Google Chromebook Pixel review: beautiful, powerful – but still just Chrome
Google has announced two new Chromecast streaming gadgets, one for streaming video and photos to a TV, and one for streaming music to any standard speakers.An updateto the original Chromecast, which has sold over 20m devices, the new video version receives streams over Wi-Fi using Google’s Cast protocol from compatible apps running on an Android or iPhone or a computer.The new Chromecast for the TV is a circular puck shape and plugs into the HDMI slot on a television via an integrated short, flat HDMI cable.The new Chromecast will be available in three colours and has a magnet that attaches the HDMI cable to the puck for storage.Photograph: GoogleThe new larger circular shape contains three Wi-Fi ariels supporting the newer dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac version, which should provide a “more robust, high quality streaming experience for less buffering than you would have found previously with the Chromecast” according to Google’s head of Chromecast for Northern Europe, Dan Saunders.The new device will also speed up streaming by pre-loading both apps and content it thinks you’ll want to access. Netflix will load its player and predict what you’re going to watch next and start buffering the video in the background before you select it so that it starts instantly without needing to wait for the first bit to download.The device will also feature more games including Rovio’s Angry Birds and some racing games, competing with Amazon’s Fire TV and Apple’s incoming new TV box.Chromecast AudioGoogle hopes the Chromecast Audio will do for the hi-fi what streaming media boxes and the Chromecast has done for TV.Photograph: GoogleGoogle’s first Chromecast Audio operates in a similar manner to the video version of Chromecast, but connects to a pair of speakers or a hi-fi via a 3.5mm line out, optical out or standard phono (RCA) jacks.“We’re trying to do for hi-fi what we’ve done with the TV – turn your hi-fi into a smart hi-ii,” said Saunders. “If you’re used to using apps on your smartphone then using the Chromecast should be easy, as all the processing and control is done on the phone.”The Chromecast Audio will support any audio streaming over Google Cast including Google’s Play Music, Deezer and TuneIn radio. Spotify also announced Chromecast support, while BBC Radio player support will be added in the near future.Google is also working on multi-room audio streaming using the Chromecast Audio, but it will not support the popular feature out of the box.Google’s Chromecast app for iOS and Android is also getting a makeover, suggesting new Chromecast apps and showcasing content from apps a user already has installed. Tapping on a show such as Breaking Bad within the new Chromecast app will take the user directly to the show within the Netflix app to start streaming it.The Chromecast app will also act as a remote control for the Chromecast streaming dongle allowing users other than the person who initiated the stream to pause playback without having to have the Netflix app or a subscription, for instance.Both new Chromecasts are powered by a microUSB cable and will be available in the next week or so, costing £30.Google Chromecast review: simple, fast internet TV
Google has launched two new flagship smartphones, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, to demonstrate what its new version of Android “Marshmallow” can do.The two new handsets are made by Google’s long-term partner LG and smartphone newcomer Huawei, and push the new features of Marshmallow, including fingerprint scanners, the new Nexus camera and Google’s improved personal assistant Now on Tap.Andrei Popescu, an engineering director within Google’s Android team, said: “The Nexus devices are our idea of embodiment of the perfect Android device – a platform for application developers to show off the new features of Marshmallow and show what Android can do.”Google Nexus 5X comes in three colours.Photograph: GoogleThe LG Nexus 5X features a 5.2in 1080p screen with a density of 423 pixels per inch (ppi), which is protected by last year’s Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3. The smartphone features the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor as the LG G4, 2GB of RAM and the choice of either 16 or 32GB of storage within a relatively compact frame.The 16GB Nexus 5X will cost £339 – £379 for 32GB of storage – and replaces the now two-year-old Nexus 5. It will be available on 16 October in the UK.The Google Nexus 6P comes in three colours, aluminium (pictured), white and black.Photograph: GoogleThe Huawei Nexus 6P is the Chinese manufacturer’s first Google Nexus device, having made Android smartphones for several years under both the Huawei and Honor brands.The Nexus 6P features a 5.7in 2K AMOLED screen with a pixel density of 518ppi, rivalling that of Samsung’s Note 5, which is protected by the latest Gorilla Glass 4, as featured on Samsung’s Galaxy S6 range of smartphones. The Huawei smartphone features the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 octo-core processor, 3GB of RAM and a choice of 32, 64 or 128GB of storage in an aluminium unibody shell available in silver, black and white.The Nexus 6P will be available from 26 October costing £449 for 32GB of storage, £499 for 64GB, and £579 for 128GB in the UK.Both new smartphones share common Google features beyond the software. Both smartphones feature quick charging and the new USB type-C connector, also used in Google’s Chromebook Pixel, the OnePlus 2 and Apple’s new MacBook. They also both feature Nexus Imprint fingerprint scanners on the back showing off Marshmallow’s now built-in support for fingerprint sensors.Popescu said: “With baked in fingerprint support in Marshmallow it will allow application developers to use the fingerprint sensor and not have to try and support each individual manufacturer’s implementation.”Google has also been able to make sure that something as important as a fingerprint is stored on the trusted zone – a secure area of the system that cannot simply be accessed by any app, as was the case for some implementations such as HTC’s One Max.Google’s new Sensor Hub motion co-processor and new Nexus Camera are also available on both smartphones, with an 12.3-megapixel image sensor that promises to capture more light and take photos faster with laser autofocus.The new Nexus smartphones will mark the start of the rollout of Google’s next version of Android, which promises to extend battery life, provide more intelligent assistance features and support more advanced hardware features such as motion and voice-recognition co-processors.Marshmallow will also continue Google’s “Material Design” aesthetic – a significant upgrade in design and uniformity across the operating system and applications that better rivals Apple’s iOS running on the company’s iPhones.Popescu said: “Marshmallow is our most polished version of Android to date.

The latest version of Apple’s laptop and desktop operating system OS X 10.11 El Capitan will genuinely speed up your computer, particularly if you’ve got an older Mac.As with Apple’s other recent Apple software updates, El Capitan is very much a blink-and-you-miss-it update. Visually it’s almost identical to the current OS X Yosemite and you will be hard-pressed to see what’s changed other than the new San Francisco typefacefrom iOS 9.That’s because El Capitan is the “tock” in Apple’s “tick, tock” two-year update cycle. Big changes happen on the surface every two years with the tick updates with the following year consolidating and refining.El Capitan’s brief was pure speed and it is really noticeable, particularly on one-or-two year-old Macs. It’s difficult to actually pinpoint where the speed comes from, it’s just generally a lot more snappy.Apps load and respond visibly faster, as do documents and emails. Switching between apps is also faster, as is browsing large PDFs, documents and images.Apple Maps gains public transport directions, mirroring iOS 9.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianApple claims that speed has improved between 1.4 and four times the performance of OS X Yosemite, depending on the task, and in my testing I would say that the figure is about right. Part of that performance boost is the introduction ofApple’s Metal graphics system, which was first introduced with iOS 8.Metal replaces OpenGL and speeds things up. Apps that use Apple’s core graphics system will benefit without having to do anything. Those that can and will interact with Metal directly – programs such as Adobe Photoshop or Premier, or games – will see an even greater boost.It’s the first version of any of Apple’s software I have installed that has actually sped up the machine.SpecificationsOS X 10.11 El Capitan is a free update from the Mac App Store released on 30 September.It supports machines with at least 2GB of RAM and 8GB of free storage space and in the following models:MacBook Pros from mid 2007 and onwardsMacBook Airs from late 2008 and onwardsMacBooks from late 2008 and onwardsMac mini from early 2009 and onwardsiMac from mid-2007 and onwardsMac Pro from early 2008 and onwardsShake and you shall seeTyping out natural language feels a little strange, but mostly does what it is meant to and makes finding files or emails a little easier.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianBeyond speed, a few small elements have been improved. Shake the cursor and it enlarges so you can see it more easily if it’s lost on screen. Spotlight search can now be moved and enlarged and responds to natural language searches such as “files I worked on in March” or “email I sent to Alex about adblocking” – which sounds great, but in practice just skips out a bit of syntax such as “subject: adblocking”.El Capitan improves full-screen window management with Split View,taken straight from iOS, allowing two apps to fill one screen with a resizing line down the middle just like Windows 8. Drag a window to the top of the screen or hold down the green “maximise” button to organise the windows and drag them on to a new space or on top of a pre-existing one to get going.It’s nothing you can’t already do manually or with third-party programssuch as Moom, but it hides menus and other unnecessary program features to fill the screen with more of the text or work you’re trying to get done.Windows 8 or 10, or iPad Air 2 users with iOS 9, will be familiar with Split View.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianIt’s still easy to lose things in multiple spaces, and users with desktops or more than one screen are likely to ignore Split View. Laptop users might find a use for it if they’re already using full screen apps.Most of Apple’s built-in apps for OS X have also been tweaked here and there. Full-screen Mac Mail is now easier to use with compose windows that minimise to the bottom of the screen and stack in tabbed windows. The same swiping gestures to archive or mark email as read from iOS also work on a touchpad too, although I found moving through mail with keyboard shortcuts easier.Safari’s now got pinned tabs, which shrink into the left-hand side and persist, which makes web apps such as Twitter a bit more permanent. A new mute button also exists in the address bar to kill annoying background audio from videos or ads.Apple Maps now shows public transport directions. Photos supports extensions as it does on iOS, allowing such apps as Pixelmator to put part of their toolset right in the image-editing window of Apple Photos. Notes now supports everything that iOS 9 Notes can do, but only allows you to view sketches, not make them.The new compose window standing and minimising makes Mac Mail much more usable in full screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianVerdictThe visual and feature changes I found were all improvements, but really the update is all about speed.El Capitan is a free upgrade and available on Wednesday. It made older machines feel like new again and didn’t break anything in my testing. I can’t see why you wouldn’t upgrade, although maybe wait and see whether any bugs pop up before updating your main machine.Pros:faster, free, Split View, better full-screen Mail, easy mute in SafariCons:some features such as advanced notes need to sync with iCloud, looks essentially the same as Yosemite, Split View not novelOther reviews•iOS 9 review: an upgrade to jump for, or skip?•Apple Watch OS2 review: more app potential but killer feature still missing•Windows 10 review – final version of Windows might be Microsoft’s best ever
Last week,63 million people were cut offfrom internet and mobile phone access in Gujarat, India. This didn’t stop Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi proclaiming over the weekend that communications access and, in particular,internet access, is the next important step in development. Modi didn’t seem bothered by the fact that, following mass demonstrations, a population the size of the UK lost all phone and internet communications forthe second time in less than a month. The world barely noticed.India is not alone. In Syria, the internet is used as a weapon of war – the disconnection of communications plays acentral role in the conflict. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, similarly, connectionswere cut following mass demonstrations against the government.And before anyone suggests that only less developed countries resort to drastic disconnection, similar measures have been discussed in case of an “emergency” in theUS,UKandGermany. The British government discussed quite extensively whether to shut down various communication channels during the2011 riots.Pakistan spearheads crackdownPakistan bears the dubious honour of leading the world in government-ordered communications shutdowns, with at least 24 large-scale disconnections since 2012­. Marked like few other nations by the global war on terror, even the highest ranks of government in Pakistan complain about the overwhelming power of the military. National security measures frequently go overboard, and the human rights of the populations affected are only insufficiently considered.Some 80% of people in Pakistan have mobile phone access. One in four holds a smartphone. When communications are disconnected, theeconomyisseriously affected, and mobility and social relations are severed. Neither ambulances nor fire departmentscan be contacted quickly. Despite the impressive resilience of the Pakistani people, the social consequences cannot be overlooked.A new research study between London, Islamabad and Berlinfound that, when communications are disconnected, the same regions already affected by other forms of exclusion are the worst hit. Large political rallies, but also regions seen as leaning towards the Taliban, are the most frequently affected by shutdowns in Pakistan. Since society constitutes through communication, for these communities, prevention of communication also constitutes exclusion from society.Disconnecting the disadvantagedThis logic extends to the waves of refugees moving across Europe. The issue here is that people don’t just need the internet to “phone home” – they need access to become part of European society. The internet is used to access education, entertainment and culture. It grounds social participation, and is the mechanism for accessing many key services. In the current crisis, the physical separation of refugees is augmented bydigital separation.“All the internet. All the people. All the time.”Nigerian web activist Nnenna Nwakanma’s call to action is simple to state, but hard to accomplish. Every crisis offers a new excuse for restrictions, and every “development problem” invites post-colonial reflex. TakeInternet.org, the initiative proudly championed by Facebook and partners. Facebook’s offer – recently partly rebrandedFree Basics, in an effort to take the sting out ofcontroversy about walled gardens, privacy and security– hasmore to do withaccess to Facebook than to the internet, and is a clever advertising campaign for Facebook’s rollout in emerging markets. But we’ve yet to see any serious attempt, notwithstanding Zuckerberg’s weekendcelebrity appeal with Bono, to resolving deep challenges of universal access.Given this landscape, we shouldn’t be surprised that we have left governments and corporations with the power to completely turn off the internet. Without the protection that accompanies the creation of public services – such as electricity or water ­– access to the internet and telecommunications are in discretionary hands. This gives both Modi and Zuckerberg the ability to flip the switch. Rather than providing all the internet to all the people all the time, we’re allowing a few powerful men to make the internet a commodity of their choosing.
At the EGX video games festival in Birmingham, Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios,took to the stage and essentially confirmedthat there will not be a follow-up to the PlayStation Vita handheld console. “The climate is not healthy for now because of the huge dominance of mobile gaming,” he lamented.But is this true?When the smartphone started its inexorable rise as a gaming platform, thanks mostly to the launch of the iPhone in 2007, business pundits were leaping over each other to declare the imminent death of the specialist games console. Why would people pay hundreds of pounds for a dedicated games machine if they were effectively carrying one around in their pockets all day? And then the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One arrived, shifting tens of millions of units, selling faster than their predecessors and generally doing okay.As for the handheld gaming sector, the area of gaming surely most at risk from mobile phones ... well, the Nintendo 3DS has now sold over 50m units, putting it within a whisker of the top ten best-selling games platforms of all time. It hasn’t done as well as the Nintendo DS, of course (150m sales), but then, the DS has been on sale for over a decade and the 3DS has only been out for four years – and it arrived in a very different, much more fragmented and diverse, market place. Unlike Vita, however, it ignored most of its competition – from internet-connected consoles, to smartphones and tablets – and did its own thing.Doing its own thing is something Nintendo has always understood, and why it has utterly dominated the handheld gaming sector. There were certainly other companies vying for a portion of the market when portable electronic games first started appearing in the late seventies, but it was Nintendo – or more specifically legendary industrial designer Gunpei Yokoi – that realised form factor, price, battery life and cuteness were going to be the defining features of a successful product.A girl playing a Gameboy during an anti-Iraq War demonstration in LondonPhotograph: Martin Argles/Martin ArglesThe Game &amp; Watch games were super simple, based on very cheap LCD screens, but they looked lovely, they were sturdy and they were cheap. When the GameBoy arrived in 1989, its monochrome display looked out of step with the wondrous visuals of the 16bit console era, but again, the tech was inexpensive and sturdy, and the games (Tetris, Super Mario Land, et al) exploited the limitations in an entirely loveable way. The combination of portability and kawaii design sensibilities meant that people actively enjoyed taking these things around with them and showing them to others.Nintendo knew almost instinctively that we would think of miniature games as endearing. There is just something about the reduced form factor that allows us to enjoy child-like experiences without feeling self-conscious. The industrial design legend Donald Norman talks about how humans project a series of expectations onto objects, and how designers need to understand these in order to make successful products. In short: we kind of want small things to be cute – and Nintendo gets that.But Nintendo’s rivals have usually made the error of thinking that to compete with Nintendo they had to beat it in terms of technology. The Neo Geo Pocket and Bandai Wonderswan totally understood the appeal of cuteness, but they were largely restricted to the Japanese market. In terms of global competitors – from the Sega Game Gear, through the Atari Lynx to the PlayStation Portable and Vita – the philosophy has been “bringing the home console experience to your pocket”. Not only has that proved costly to the consumer in terms of retail price and battery life, it grates against what a lot of people want from a portable experience.Sometimes, as a race, we allow ourselves to be loveable. It doesn’t happen much and we often have to express it in quite obtuse ways – through novelty socks, or action figure collections, or really liking Pixar movies. Portable games fit into this mode of thinking. The most successful handheld franchises – Pokemon, Animal Crossing, Cooking Mama, Professor Layton – they’re all reasonably complex experiences, but they’re also really, really cute. They fit the form factor – both physically and psychologically.Animal Crossing – Nintendo has always understood that we equate cute form factors with cute gamesPhotograph: ObserverThe PlayStation Portable wasn’t cute. Vita isn’t cute. Both tried to compete, in industrial design terms, with home consoles and with smartphones, dropping into an awkward aesthetic space between the two. When gamers first saw Ridge Racer on the Sony PSP they gasped in wonder – a true console experience on the go – but it turned out that not many people wanted that; not just because PSP was more expensive, but because (to a lot of people) it just felt weird to sit on a bus with this ostentatious piece of cold, sleek gaming technology.The idea of the Vita as a mini PlayStation 3 or 4 has stifled the creativity of developers. Stunted compromised spin-offs of major console titles like Uncharted and Call of Duty have done very little except underline the differences between a home machine and a portable gadget. They didn’t work. It’s no coincidence that the most successful series on Sony’s handheld machines – Monster Hunter – is very much in the Nintendo mould of highly sociable titles with childlike collection systems.Monster Hunter has proved one of the most successful brands on PlayStation handhelds because it is social and sharable. This dedicated Gathering Hall was set up for fans in London in 2009Photograph: PRSony has tried to innovate in hardware terms with OLED screens, proprietary memory card formats, proprietary optical discs and strange touch pads underneath the display. But these have usually been ignored by developers and read by consumers as a way to gouge more money from them. The philosophy of the home console race cannot be applied to the portable market because the consumer mindset is totally different. Sony may have had more success if it had really,reallypushed the product as a homebase for offbeat experiments and indie projects – there have certainly been plenty of those along the way. But the marketing attention was often elsewhere.The GameBoy, the DS and the 3DS haven’t just dominated this sector because they got the basics right – battery life, cost and sturdiness – they dominated because Nintendo understands that small things are cute and that cuteness pervades the whole experience. This is exactly what’s going on in the smartphone sector with Candy Crush, Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds. Bringing a game like Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer into work or school is a very specific experience that has nothing to do with technology or gadgetry.The Vita hasn’t really struggled because of mobile games, it has struggled because people don’t want to hug it.
When media types talk about YouTube and football, there is often speculation that Google’s online video service will at some point throw its hat into the ring for live rights – whether the Premier League or World Cup.Yet the company’s latest football move is more about backing the underdog, British channelCopa90, with a high-profile advertising campaign involving online ads and billboards around London.Copa90 is one of two channels – the other is cookery channelSorted Food– to get such a campaign this year, following in the footsteps ofZoella, Vice News and the SlowMoGuys in 2014.For Copa90, the campaign is the reward for steady growth on YouTube since it launched in 2012. It is averaging nearly 3.6m views and 13.8m minutes watched every month, and recently reached the milestone of 1 million subscribers.Tom Thirlwall, chief executive of parent company Bigballs Films, said the campaign is “designed to reach every single 16- to 24-year-old football fan in the UK”, and sees it as a much more logical sports strategy for YouTube than entering the live-rights market.“YouTube always champions the alternative: the independent outsider. For them to just go chasing after sports rights would have never made sense to me,” said Thirlwall.“The fact that they’re championing us, though; who knows where we’ll be in terms of rights when it comes to Rio next year [for the Olympic Games], the Euros, the next World Cup? We might be bidding for rights ourselves, or being brought into rights packages because those rightsholders want a younger audience who they’re not getting on TV.”When Copa90 launched in September 2012, the company had decided against seeking live or highlights rights, preferring instead to create its own “digital-native” formats, aiming to tell the stories of football fans that the mainstream media only touched on at best.Copa90’s latest promotional video.“I think we’ve started a disruption, and an analysis by the major sports-media businesses as to how you actually engage with young fans. These companies are straight one-to-many broadcasters, employing ex-footballers in suits to talk about the games,” said Thirlwall.“It’s all highly agenda-ed and planned, and anyone under the age of 30 is basically saying to us that it just doesn’t resonate with them in any way. These are the people who are watching goals on Vine, viewing streamed games, and coming to us to find the stories that don’t get shed a light on elsewhere.”He claimed the 2014 World Cup showed this difference starkly, with traditional broadcasters housed in the same building in Rio, while Copa90 “had presenters on deckchairs on the beach, up in the jungle, in the fan parks, in the bars and in the taxis with the fans … all the fun was happening outside the hermetically-sealed boxes of the television companies”.Copa90’s public rhetoric matches many other YouTube channels and multi-channel networks by talking up its appeal to young viewers and its disruptive role in the TV industry, while at the same time holding itself out as a potential solution for those broadcasters’ desire to win those fans back.“We could be seen as the greatest threat to linear-TV broadcasting of sport, but also potentially the clue to how they reverse that trend, and how we could become the biggest complement to that. We have that young audience, and we know how to move that young audience around,” said Thirlwall.Copa90 is not alone in being a potential partner for the broadcasters. In October 2014,Sky invested $7m (£4.6m) in online network Whistle Sports, then in September 2015 the pairlaunched a YouTube channel based around Sky’s Soccer AM show– a clear rival for Copa90.“They’re following our approach there. There is no greater flattery or compliment to what we’re doing to see Sky attempting to follow in our footsteps,” said Thirlwall.Copa90 has focused on football fans for many of its films.Like other YouTube-born broadcasters, Copa90 sees its main source of revenues coming from brands and sponsorship deals, with Bigballs’ executive team having cut their teeth working on commercial films for companies such as Adidas, Nike and Vodafone before launching Copa90.“We were at an advantage. We knew how to make credible, authentic branded content, and we took all that knowledge into the world of football,” said Thirlwall, who cheerfully slide-tackled the suggestion from some quarters of the online-TV world that the economics of YouTube are challenging.“We’re not ones to come out with negative opinions. If you think you can’t earn money on YouTube, you’re not thinking or trying hard enough,” he said.“A year ago, this was about survival, but now more and more brands and advertising agencies are looking at digital video and its power. It’s shared media. And the conversations we are having now are vastly different to a year ago, as we look forward to the Euros next year.”Sky and Whistle Sports will surely not be the last example of the sports broadcasters moving onto Copa90’s turf, but Thirlwall remained bullish about his company’s ability to compete – backed by YouTube – with the big guns of the broadcasting world.“Can and will the sports broadcast community come into this space? Absolutely. But the problem is that big media businesses always handle young audiences very clumsily, and often in a very patronising way. Ultimately, it’s very difficult to move away from their legacy business models,” he said.“They can never commit to it with the lack of fear and risk-taking sense of abandon that we had. It’s hard to go from being a top-down business where everything’s programmed and formatted to within an inch of its life, to throwing off those shackles and doing it in a different way.”
Amazon has made its first serious foray into the so-called“gig economy”, advertising for part-time delivery drivers in Seattle as part of a programme called “Amazon Flex”.The drivers, who will be delivering packages ordered through its same-hour delivery product Amazon Prime Now, will be paid between $18-$25 an hour to work for the company, but they have to provide their own car and Android phone.Amazon advertises the role to potential workers “be your own boss: deliver when you want, as much as you want”.“You can choose any available 2, 4, and 8-hour blocks of time to work the same day, or set availability for up to 12 hours per day for the future. You can work as much or as little as you want,” the company explained in an FAQ.The job advert plunges Amazon into the middle of an ongoing debate about the nature of work in a connected economy. Frequently referred to as the “sharing economy”, a reference to the fact that service providers at firms such as Uber or AirBnB are “sharing” their assets, such as their car or house, the new model has led to lawsuits in a number of countries.Uber, in particular, has beenrepeatedly sued by former driversarguing that they were in fact employees of the firm, rather than simple third-party contractors. That distinction has led to an alternative name for the trend, the “1099 economy”, after the US tax form which reports the pay of an independent contractor. But both “sharing” and “1099” economy fail to capture the evolution of the model; the latter ignores the fact that it exists outside the US, while the former emphasises who owns the assets being used, rather than who is doing the labour. One term becoming more commonly used to to refer to firms such as TaskRabbit, AirBnB and Amazon Flex is the “gig economy”, as it highlights the short-term, tenuous nature of the employment.This move isn’t Amazon’s first foray into that world. The company was actually a trendsetter in the field, with its Mechanical Turk service allowing people to earn a small amount of money for completing simple tasks which are easy for people but hard for computers. According to one report,the average “hourly wage” for a Mechanical Turk workerwas between $1 and $5 in 2013.
A co-founder of the Pirate Bay has been released from prison after serving three years for copyright and hacking offences.Gottfrid Svartholm was initially convicted in 2011, when his involvement with the bittorrent site led to a one-year prison sentence handed down in Stockholm, Sweden. Svartholm, also known as Anakata online, had been found guilty in absentia alongside three of his Pirate Bay colleagues for copyright infringement. He had avoided the trial, and no-one, including his lawyer, knew his whereabouts.Svartholm was later arrested in Cambodia in 2012, and transferred to Sweden to serve out his sentence. But in 2013, he was again charged and found guilty of hacking and fraud offences, leading to a further two years on his prison sentence. He appealed, and was cleared of one specific charge of hacking a bank, but a second conviction for hacking IT company Logica was upheld. As a result, his second sentence was reduced from two years to one.As that sentence was coming to an end, Svartholm was extradited to Denmark where he again stood trial for hacking offences. He was convicted and sentenced to another three and a half years in prison.He was released early for good behaviour in August, but promptly re-arrested upon his release and extradited back to Sweden, where he still had one final month of his hacking conviction to serve out in that country.In June, as he faced release in Sweden,his mother told industry news site TorrentFreak that“what Gottfrid wants to do now, more than anything else, is to get back to his developmental work within IT”.She added: “And, of course, first of all: to sit by a keyboard again after nearly three years away from one.”With Svartholm’s release, all of the original co-founders of the Pirate Bay are now free. Peter Sunde had been arrested after Svartholm, but released from jail before himafter serving his sentence in Västervik prison, south of Stockholm, while the last of the group, Fredrik Neij - known as TiAMO online –was arrested in Thailand in 2014.
Microsoft has responded to Windows 10 users’ privacy fears by insisting that it does not scan emails, messages or files for advertising purposes.When Windows 10 launched some users complained that Microsoft hadcompromised their privacydue to its default settings.It was later revealed that even when all data collection settings were turned off Windows 10still sent identifiable data to Microsoft.Now Microsoft has moved to clarify the types of data it collects. Terry Myerson, Microsoft’s executive vice president of Windows and Devicessaid: “No matter what privacy options you choose, neither Windows 10 nor any other Microsoft software scans the content of your email or other communications, or your files, in order to deliver targeted advertising to you.”Myerson explained that Windows 10 collects two types of data. The first is designed to help Microsoft and third-parties identify bugs or problems in software – items such as crash logs, system information and other diagnostic data.“This doesn’t include any of your content or files,” says Myerson. “And we take several steps to avoid collecting any information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or account ID.”Behavioural data for Cortana and personalisationWindows 10 also collects information on user habits in the name of personalisation. Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana collects the most, but it and other settings that remember preferences such as favourite sports teams and commonly typed words can be disabled.This type of personalisation and behavioural data is commonly used by other platforms for digital assistants and other machine learning processes that adjust to the user, such as Google Now, Siri and autocorrect software for keyboards.However, when all personalisation features were turned off Windows 10 was found tosend personally identifiable dataassociated with Microsoft’s OneDrive and an unknown content delivery network.Microsoft has been under fire from privacy advocates with some describing Windows 10 as the most invasive Windows yet. It has also seenissues with compulsory automatic updates, and has been seen todownload itself onto user machineswithout permission, but is considered to be thebest Windows version yet.Its rate of adoption is also higher than Windows 7 or 8 within the first few months, according to data from web analytics firm StatCounter, which saw Windows 10 account for 4.9% of desktop internet users in August. Windows 7 held the controlling 48.1% share of desktop internet users in the month.How can I move my files and programs to a new PC?Microsoft Windows 10 free upgrade revisited: seven more of your questions answered
We all know that video games offer us the chance to do things we’d never dream of doing in real life – robbing banks, slaying dragons, sorting falling shapes into the right position to make them disappear. Crazy stuff.But in structural terms, games are nowhere near as rebellious and anarchic as they appear. Most are packed with rules and frameworks which are specifically designed to restrict the player – and there is usually a central narrative that youhaveto follow if you want to see the end. This is fine in a lot of genres, where rules are obviously necessary to create a tight play structure. But only a select few titles labelled as “open world” or “sandbox” adventures let you completely and utterly shatter the experience intended for you by the developers – or at least punish you in an imaginative way.Look at the role-playing video game (RPG) genre. Most modern RPGs now opt for a non-linear open-world approach to design, which ostensibly allows players the freedom to explore and experiment. Presented with this sense of freedom, the first thing I tend to do is see who I can attack – and in an RPG, that’s usually the initial quest-giver; the non-player character (NPC), tasked with laboriously welcoming you to the world. So while some over-earnest high elf is telling me all about the 1,000 year war that has plagued the land of Graxitor, I’m just trying to decapitate him.While an over-earnest high elf is talking about the war that has plagued Graxitor, I’m just trying to decapitate himMost games will pretend this isn’t happening by having your attacks simply rebound harmlessly off your target while they carry on with their exposition. This is because there’s normally an overarching narrative and a carefully constructed backstory that the writers are desperate for you to uncover. Much more interesting though are the games that go beyond passively ignoring you and actively punish you for being a jerk. Some slightly bolder titles, for example, will have the quest-giver immediately destroy you in retaliation – which is the game designer’s equivalent of a slap on the wrist for being naughty.A very, very small number will actually let you kill the character and then quietly work out what to do about that. These games don’t so much smack your wrist as breathe a heavy sigh and mutter, “OK,that’show it’s going to be, is it? Fine, let’s see how you like it now”. My favourite example of this is Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind where you can openly and brazenly slay anyone who is trying to help you. It’s not until after you’ve committed the deed, however, that the game tells you the world is now doomed (oops) and that saving the file will mean you’re unable to complete the adventure. The core narrative is only a comparatively small part of Morrowind though, so you can still enjoy what is now an openly doomed and nihilistic existence.Later Elder Scrolls instalments carried this on to a point. You can rough house critical story characters in Oblivion for example but they don’t die, they fight you until you knock them down – then they simply get back up and talk to you as though nothing has happened. When Sheogorath, the all-powerful Madgod of the Shivering Isles, is giving you a quest, you can go ahead and attack him if you like – but he’ll smirk, freeze you in place and then teleport you into the air where you fall to your death. This is a fantastic (and contextually relevant) way to tell a gamer off. Unfortunately, The Elder Scrolls Online dispenses with this entirely and, while you can attack unimportant NPCs in towns (often by accident), key characters are immune to damage and all attacks simply warp through them.Bioware’s role-playing classicBaldur’s Gateallows you to kill your foster father in the prologue. He is far, far stronger than the player character, but it is technically possible and results in bringing the game’s story to an abrupt halt. Unlike in Morrowind, there is no “you’ve just broken the game” warning dialogue box – your character is simply stuck in the prologue forever. That game’s recent spiritual successor, Pillars of Eternity, carries this mechanic to a degree but if you kill a key character, it basically states that, once again, the world is completely doomed – at which point the game ends.Older titles, particularly point-and-click adventures, carried this feature more prominently in a way that’d be simply untenable with modern-day audiences. Forgetting to pick up an item, or carrying out tasks in the wrong order, wouldn’t only result in a game being impossible to finish, the game also wouldn’ttellyou it was impossible to finish. You could make a mistake in the first act, not realise, spend hours getting through the rest of the adventure and then unceremoniously die when you reached a pivotal moment in the story. Kings Quest, a lauded, brilliant series, would spring this on a player quite often and with its inane puzzles and baffling challenges it was easy to miss a mundane item that would turn out to be game-breaking later.The X-Files full motion video (FMV) game, which came out in the 1990s when the genre was considered The Future, is another interesting example. For all its faults the adventure did a lot to pull you into its world: you had a realistic PDA to check, you could use various items on people to get different reactions out of them – and you could pull a gun on any of the bureau staff, including Assistant Director Skinner, who would say “don’t do that”, like a parent telling you to stop sticking your butter knife in the toaster. You didn’t have to listen to him; indeed, you could pretty much shoot anyone and the game would (realistically, to be honest) end right there with a scene of your arrest. And there you were as a gamer, back on the naughty step until you played properly.Perhaps in the future, developers will allow more of the game experience to be governed by procedurally generated narratives and AI-assisted characters that can react in real-time to whatever you do. The random quests generated in titles like Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim hint in this direction, as do thereal-time personal rivalriesin Shadow of Mordor. One day, then, we may well get the freedom to be the players we want to be – even if we want to be assholes.

Analysts put sales in China at between 3m and 4m units, leaving sales elsewhere essentially flat year-over-year.My initial estimates were China could add 3-4 million units to iPhone launch sales and I think that was about right.&mdash; Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin)September 28, 2015The company allowed 16 days for its presale period (last year it gave itself 10) and the phone officially went on sale 25 September. It will continue to roll out around the world through October.“Sales for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any previous first weekend sales results in Apple’s history,” wrote Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a press release.The devices’ success is a testament to the reliability of Apple’s user base, said Ramon Llamas, a mobile market analyst for International Data Corporation (IDC).“The fact that this is an S version and not a whole new body type version speaks to how much clout Apple has with end-users out there,” Llamas said. “People usually wait for the new version, but there’s a sizable number that says: ‘No, we’d rather have the incremental version and move forward.’”The popularity of the devices is also likely to make for greater Apple Watch adoption, Llamas said – or at least to remove a barrier to Apple Watch adoption, since the watch only works with iOS devices.The phone’s major upgradesinclude what Apple is calling 3D touch, in which the touchscreen responds not solely to touch but to pressure, as well, and the standard camera megapixel and processor improvements. Llamas said he expects to see the “home” button disappear before long.
Every new smartphone is meant to be better than the last, but hardiness is often not included in that upgrade. Now the iPhone 6S has been dropped, bent, scratched and now submerged in water, how tough is it?Last year users complained about the iPhoneending up bentafter trips through user pockets. Testersthen took their thumbsto various other large and thin smartphones, including Samsung’s Galaxy Note series.This year saw Samsung claim a1.7 times strength increasewithin itsGalaxy S6 smartphonesto try and stop bending. Apple also switched to a stronger aluminium for its iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which it claims is harder, but is it and will it bend? Vlogger Christian from FoneFox put it to the test.Bending the iPhone 6S.The iPhone 6S Plus seems to be more resilient. Requiring two people to actually bend it indicates users are unlikely to do it by accident. Chalk this one up to positive consumer action from last year’sbendgate.Dropping and scratchingBending isn’t quite in the same consumer-issue league as dropping smartphones. The harder aluminium used in the new iPhone helps it survive drops on to its edges and back better than last year’s iPhone 6S, with fewer marks and deformations in the frame. Dropping it on to the screen still has a predictable effect, according to vlogger David Rahimi:Dropping on to hard floor.Apple claims its X-ion glass screen is the hardest in the business, and while it will stand up to keys, knives, grit and sandpaper are not the iPhone 6S’s friend, according to vlogger JerryRigEverything:Scratching and bending.Samsung’s Galaxy S6 with its Corning Gorilla Glass 4 can apparentlysurvive a Stanley knife blade, for comparison, but neither screen is a match for sandpaper or grit in the pocket.Taking a bathApple doesn’t claim that the iPhone 6S is waterproof, but it seems that the phone is a lot more capable of surviving a dip into water than last year’s iPhone 6 and most other non-waterproof or water-resistant smartphones.Are the new iPhones waterproof?The phones survived an hour of submersion in water, and continued working without issue. Even the exposed Lightning and headphones ports worked fine after the dip, andcontinued to do so 48 hours later, according to vlogger Zach Straley.Another vlogger wasnot so lucky with his testing, showing neither smartphone surviving unscathed after a 30-minute submersion, however.Both the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are heavier and thicker than last year’s iPhone and it seems Apple’s claims that they are more durable with harder aluminium frames stands up to testing. But whether they are waterproof seems to be up for debate.How pink is the new ‘rose gold’ iPhone 6S?Apple iPhone 6S and 6S Plus review roundup: stronger, faster, heavier
Want more from your television without having to buy a new one? You need a streaming box. Here are five of the best on the market.Now TVSky’s new Now TV Box is a cutdown version of the Roku 2, with fewer features and streaming channels but at at a much lower cost.Photograph: SkyCost:£15One of the cheapest and best media streamers around. It is a rebranded Roku 2, which costs £70, with Wi-Fi and ethernet connectivity.The black box, which is 18cm sq, sits on top of almost anything, but needs its own power adapter. It is fast and outputs video in 1080p and audio in Dolby Digital Plus.It requires a Now TV account and is limited to Sky’s excellent Now TV movies, entertainment and sport services, Sky’s pay-per-view store and a select number of catchup services, including BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, All 4 and Demand 5.There is no support for Netflix or Amazon’s Prime Video streaming services.Verdict:excellent value for money, but limited support for streaming services.Amazon Fire TV StickAmazon’s Fire TV stick with voice-control remote.Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/ReutersCost:£35 or £45The Amazon Fire TV stick looks like a USB flash drive and plugs directly into the HDMI port at the back of the TV. It is powered by a micro-USB cable, but needs to be plugged into its own power adapter.The remote can be pointed anywhere and the setup is incredibly easy: if bought from Amazon it comes with your details pre-loaded. There’s a simple how-to video when it is first installed too.The interface is slick, it needs an Amazon account and works best with Amazon’s £79 Prime service, which includes a video-on-demand service with a solid selection of movies and TV and a music subscription service with access to 1 million tracks.Other apps are available, including Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Spotify and more from the Amazon app store. The streaming quality is good, there’s a smartphone app for voice searches and if you own an Amazon Fire tablet you can mirror its screen on the TV.It also plays games such as Minecraft, Sonic, Tetris and Crossy Road and supports an optional Bluetooth games controller.Two versions are available, one with a voice-controlled remote and one without, with a £10 difference.Verdict:best for Amazon subscribers, but good value and support for most other services.ChromecastGoogle’s Chromecast can be powered by the USB port on your TV.Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesCost:£30This takes a very different approach to turning your TV smart. It acts as a receiver for your smartphone, tablet or laptop, using Google’s Cast service across your home network.It beams whatever is on your phone screen on to the TV, then uses the phone as a remote. There is no real interface for the Chromecast without a phone or laptop, beyond displaying background pictures, and so requires compatible apps such YouTube, Netflix and BBC iPlayer to work.Hundreds of Chromecast-compatible apps are available for Android and iPhone.It’s another small stick, which plugs straight into the HDMI slot on the TV, and can be powered by the USB port on your TV, unlike the Amazon Fire TV Stick.Verdict:simple to install and use, but requires a smartphone, tablet or computer.Apple TVThe Apple TV is probably the best looking streamer in the group, a simple black box with crisp lines.Photograph: Jamie Mann / Alamy/AlamyCost:£59One of the oldest streaming boxes available, the third generation Apple TV is currently available for £60, but anew version will be available in Novemberfor around £140 with a motion-control remote, voice search and apps.The current incarnation of the small black box can be controlled using a slim metal remote or via the Remote app on the iPhone or iPad, which makes entering text easier.Built around iTunes, the Apple TV is the only device here that can play movies and music from Apple’s digital store, but also supports Netflix, Sky’s Now TV service, YouTube and a small selection of other services.The Apple TV supports AirPlay, Apple’s version of Google Cast, which streams video using your home network from an iPhone, iPad or Mac and a compatible app, such as BBC iPlayer.Verdict:best for Apple users who want iTunes content on their TV and can’t wait till November.Roku 2The Roku 2 is a small black box, which isn’t quite as slick as Apple’s TV but is fast and has many more features and streaming services.Photograph: RokuCost:£70The same as the Now TV box, but with all the limitations removed. It is the Swiss Army knife of streaming boxes, with hundreds of apps and services called channels available in the Roku storeNetflix, YouTube, Google Play movies and TV, Spotify and many more are available, including all the catchup services such as BBC iPlayer, Sky’s Now TV and Sky Store and even the Firefox browser.Apps and games are available, including Pac-Man and Fieldrunners, while local media playback via the microSD card slot on the back is also good. The Roku can play content streamed from a home-media server too.The Roku’s universal search helps you find what you want to play and its movie recommendation service monitors what you watch and suggests other things you might like.The remote feels a little cheap and its reach isn’t very far for infrared, but the interface can be customised and is easy to navigate, even if it isn’t slick.The one thing missing is Amazon Prime video, which is available in the US Roku store but not in the UK. That might change soon.Verdict:the do-it-all streamer.Other reviewsTop 5 phablets for early 2015: Which is the best for big-screen smartphone lovers?Five of the best smartwatches for early 2015
WWE wrestling, children’s nursery rhymes and Turkish music videos were the biggest hits on YouTube in August 2015, according to the latest chart of the online video service’s top channels.The American wrestling channel topped that month’schart of the most-viewed YouTube channels, published by analytics firm OpenSlate and industry site Tubefilter, with 456.4m views of its videos.That putWWE– boosted by clips from its annual Summerslam event – ahead of British children’s music channelLittle Baby Bum, whose videos were watched 448.4m times in August.Turkish music channelnetd müzikranked third in the chart with 433.6m views, with Minecraft gamerThe Diamond Minecart(394.5m) andBuzzFeed Video(373.5m) rounding out the top five.The WWE has been growing its YouTube views and audience steadily over the last two years. In August 2013,its videos were watched 41.8m times, making it the 52nd most popular YouTube channel according to the OpenSlate/Tubefilter chart.A year later, in August 2014,the WWE was the 15th biggest channel on YouTubewith 149.4m views. Its monthly views have thus tripled in the past year, while its number of subscribers on YouTube has nearly doubled from 3.9 million to 7.7 million in the same period.Related:Google launches YouTube Gaming to challenge Amazon-owned TwitchThat growth is partly the result of YouTube’s overall growth. In August 2014, the service’s top 100 channels’ videos were watched 10.2bn times, but a year later that total was 17.4bn – year-on-year growth of 70.6%.YouTube itself prefers other metrics to chart its growth. The company says its overall “watch time” – the amount of time people watch videos for – has grown by 60% in the last year, while its number of active daily users is up 40%.The latest OpenSlate / Tubefilter chart also highlights a relatively lowly ranking for gamer Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg, who for a long time owned the most popular channel on YouTube.In August 2015, his channel dropped out of the top 10, with 302.7m views making it the 11th most popular on YouTube. However, PewDiePie remains the most subscribed-to channel, ending August with 39.5 million subscribers. The channel also recentlyreached the milestone of 10bn total views.•PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist mobile game – review
Soon, ridiculing the idea of watching other people play video games will seem ridiculous in itself. People do, and in increasingly large numbers online.YouTube has“hundreds of millions” of people watching “billions of hours” of gaming videosevery month, with its top 100 games channelsgenerating 7.3bn video views in July 2015 alone.Meanwhile Twitch – the service bought by Amazon in 2014 – hasmore than 100 million monthly viewerswatching its live and archived gaming video-streamsfor an average of 1.5 hours a day.Related:Google launches YouTube Gaming to challenge Amazon-owned TwitchTogether, YouTube and Twitch have made games – from walkthrough “Let’s Play” videos to live eSports tournaments – one of the fastest-growing television genres, almost entirely outside the traditional television industry.For most of this category’s history, YouTube and Twitch have not been in direct competition: YouTube’s gaming focus was on videos shot, edited and uploaded to its service, while Twitch’s was on live streams of gameplay and chat.In the space of the last month, though, that has changed. First, YouTube launched itsYouTube Gamingapp, with its emphasis on live streams as well as recorded videos accompanied by new features for channels streaming gameplay live on the service.Now Twitch is moving into YouTube’s heartland of recorded videos. The company has announced plans to enable its broadcasters to upload videos to their channels, as they would to YouTube.Twitch users will also be able to create playlists from their archives, essentially meaning their channels broadcast 24 hours a day, rather than only when they are online and streaming live.Both YouTube and Twitch are making a similar pitch to their video creators: use one service for everything, rather than dividing their attention between two. Until now, many games broadcasters have used both services: uploading videos to YouTube and streaming live on Twitch.Minecraft gamer Jordan “CaptainSparklez” Maron is one of the most prominent examples:his YouTube channel has 8.8 million subscribers, whilehis Twitch channel has 1.2 million followers.“So many people who I know, although they still do YouTube,Twitchhas become more and more of a major thing – myself included,” hetold the Guardian in August.“It’s a cool, different way to interact with people: they can give you direct feedback in the chat in Twitch, which is something you can’t get on YouTube. It works very well for games, and it’s a little bit more casual than YouTube: you can take a break, answer questions from the chat, and mess around a little bit more.”As YouTube gets more like Twitch, and Twitch gets more like YouTube, Maron and the emerging crop of gaming personalities will be choosing whether to throw their lot in with one of the platforms, or continue to divide their energies (and audiences) between the two.YouTube Gaming is unlikely to be a “Twitch-killer”, and vice versa: as more brands shift portions of their advertising budgets in the direction of these audiences, there is scope for both to prosper.Related:Twitch's co-founder on the curious appeal of watching gamers gameMeanwhile, the battle between two platforms backed bybig-techparents will be healthy, as YouTube and Twitch compete to provide new features for their creators and gaming viewers alike.For live streams especially, that’s important. This is a television format combining gameplay footage, video feeds of players and live chat between those players and their viewers – and between the viewers themselves. The language of this format is still developing, not to mention the business models around it.That’s why the competition between YouTube and Twitch is about more than each service adding new features to move on to turf occupied by the other.Too much of the outside world – the media industry included – still struggles to understand why anyone would find entertainment in watching other people playing games. But it’s those burgeoning audiences on YouTube and Twitch that are defining how their respective cultures and communities evolve, which will in turn be the key influence on this new entertainment genre.
It’s Monday again somehow.
Fruit Ninja has just turned five. The slice-and-dice game has been downloaded more than a billion times. That’s no small number, so its Brisbane-based creator, Halfbrick Studios, celebrated with cake.“One of the guys here who was from the team that made Fruit Ninja, his wife makes cakes,” says Halfbrick’s chief executive, 40-year-old Shainiel Deo.Shainiel Deo of Halfbrick Studios.Photograph: Halfbrick StudiosA reference to2007 puzzle game Portalsuddenly feels appropriate: was the cake alie? “You had to do it,” he laughs uproariously, before becoming intensely serious. “No. It was an awesome cake.”Making video games in Australia is also serious business and not for the faint of heart. Fellow BrisbanitesTHQ Australiaclosed in 2011, as did the Melbourne crewBlue Tongue. The last local AAA studio (industry code for a major production company),2K Australiashuttered its Canberra digs in April.It might have happened to Halfbrick too. Founded in 2001, for the company’s first seven years earnings primarily came from working on international projects. Then the global financial crisis hit, and all of a sudden Australia was no longer an affordable place to create entertainment products. With Halfbrick at risk of becoming Quarterbrick, and 70-odd employees at its Brisbane headquarters alone, that didn’t feel like a nice way to double down.So in 2010 Deo set himself an ultimatum: “Get rich or die tryin’”. He says the company began pitching sessions for game ideas, called Halfbrick Fridays. “Guys would get up and pitch an idea and, if someone else liked it, they’d join them and form a prototype. They’d go away and work on those prototypes every Friday for about six or seven Fridays.“I guess the goal for this particular Halfbrick Friday was an iPhone game your mum can play – and Fruit Ninja was the fruit of that.” He says when the idea was pitched, only one other person saw any potential in it, meeting the minimum criterion for a project to be kicked off. “Thankfully there was that one, otherwise that idea would have died on the vine, so to speak.”Related:Halfbrick launches maths-teaching sequel to Fruit Ninja mobile gameFruit Ninja grew to epic proportions in a relatively short amount of time. Launched in April 2010, by July it had hit 1m downloads. Soon after that itappeared on Mythbustersand the members of One Directiondeclared they were fansof “real-life Fruit Ninja” (slicing actual fruit in the air) – something Deo seems comically embarrassed by.In terms of marketing, the campaign was kept lo-fi, he says. “Everything was on a shoestring. If you look at our original Fruit Ninja trailer, I think it’s got at least two members of our development team. Our chief marketing officer at the time was holding the camera!”Deo attributes Fruit Ninja’s wildfire success to its slicey little mechanics and some fortuitous timing. In what seems familiar now, five years ago Fruit Ninja was one of the earliest games to showcase the simple and intuitive pleasures of touch devices. The game generated enough downloads to get traction on the Australian download charts. “Apple saw that and picked it up and showcased that to other countries, and then it just all exploded from there.”Deo says the game “put Australia on the map” in the gaming world yet few Australians outside the industry are aware Fruit Ninja is “locally grown”.Related:Pokémon Go: new mobile game will let you catch Pokémon in the real worldWith the gaming landscape anything but static, Deo says the company doesn’t take its position as a global leader in app-making for granted. “Apps aren’t the gold rush they were and the business models are changing all the time, too. When we first got involved it was all about paid apps, then it transitioned to ‘freemium’ and free-to-play based on internet purchases. Now we’ve been seeing the use of ad-supported apps.”Will Australia ever refocus its development lens on consoles and computers? “I don’t think we will, really, because the level of investment and manpower required is just so huge now, I think the risk is too great.”Mobile game apps still provide a lot of room for innovation and, as they are better integrated with people’s lifestyles, the market for them is “massive”, he says.“Not everyone can have the time to sit in front of their TV for two hours and play a AAA console experience. But everyone can pull out their mobile device and play for two minutes here and there and get a lot out of it.”
The Indian prime minister Narendra Modi seemed at home at Facebook headquarters on Sunday, in a town hall event seen by many as an attempt by Facebook to gain much-needed support for its expansive ambitions in India.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was certainly in a welcoming mood, changing his profile picture to include an Indian flag and writing: “I changed my profile picture to support Digital India, the Indian government’s effort to connect rural communities to the internet and give people access to more services online.”At the 50-minute event, both men became emotional. Modi told the audience women were vital to thefuture of his country, and came close to crying when he discussed his mother’s role in his life. She had struggled when he was younger, he said, in order to “make ends meet”.“A mother will never want you to become something; she will think about how you will achieve that,” he said. “I am from a very ordinary family, a very poor family. I sold tea in railway stations.”For his part, Zuckerberg told Modi about a little-known incident several years ago when, he said, Facebook “wasn’t doing so well”. The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, he said, urged him to take a spiritual trip to India and visit a temple there.The journey, Zuckerberg said, cleared his head and helped reaffirm Facebook’s mission to connect billions of people around the world.Related:Narendra Modi arrives for Silicon Valley tour as India's influence growsModi and Zuckerberg’s conversation turned, inevitably, toward economics andthe role of the internet and technology in India. That was why many of the Facebook workers present showed up.“We have been hearing from a lot of people here at work that India is a top priority, like China, and to have the prime minister here speaking it shows that there is a lot of excitement for us,” Paresh, a 37-year-old Facebook employee who declined to give his surname, told the Guardian.“I think we all, and especially us Indians, are looking forward to the opportunity to get moving in India.”Speaking to an audience of around 1,000, Modi said: “India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world today. My dream is to become a $20tn economy.“India at this point needs both physical and digital infrastructure,” he added, highlighting his government’s efforts to offer cheaper, localized internet services, an effort which has largely been made with the help of Facebook’sInternet.orginitiative.Given criticism in India of Facebook regarding its alleged promotion of its own applications and services over Indian equivalents, Zuckerberg and the Internet.org team hoped Modi’s visit would attract support.Gary Hopkins, 30, a web developer who has worked with Facebook on and off for a number of years, told the Guardian he was “interested to see what not only Modi had to say, but how Facebook would work the political game into trying to get more backing for their India efforts”.“It’s a huge market and we all know the importance of that,” he said.Gaurav Patel, a coder at Facebook, said the tech world and Facebook were uniquely capable of addressing challenges unique to India, due to the large number of Indians working in Silicon Valley.“I think we are heading in the right direction and have a ton of potential in India and we shouldn’t really talk about something that we don’t really know that facts,” he said.Related:Narendra Modi aims to bolster India's tech credentials on US visit“This is why Modi is here, so he can show his support for us Indians who have come to America to work, and now that there are chances for coming home and helping there, it is very hopeful.”Modi said social media had first been a personal interest and he had not expected to become prime minister when he started using Twitter and Facebook, platforms on which he now has tens of millions of followers.“It was about my curiosity towards technology,” he said.That curiosity has helped Facebook push into India. Modi said on Sunday that the internet helped him to govern. In the crowd, a few spectators mumbled about recent attempts by Modi’s government to censor and curtail internet viewership.The lead-up to the event was marked by a PR effort from Facebook. Chris Daniels, vice-president of Internet.org, discussed the role the company could have in India.“In April, I went to India and we heard the feedback from the community there that they felt that the platform was not as open as it could be to developers,”he told the Economic Times. “Both Facebook as a whole and Internet.org have a big role to play in the entrepreneurial ecosystem of India.”While Sunday’s event did not reveal any specifics about increased connectivity between India and Facebook, Zuckerberg was all smiles throughout.“I am personally impressed by the way PM Modi has used social media to connect with [the] people of India, be it women’s issues or to spread messages of peace,” he said.Outside the event, a small group of protesters demanded that Modi take responsibility fora 2002 massacre in Gujarat, the state of which he was then chief minister.Modi was due to complete his short California visit with an event at San Jose’s SAP Center, where 20,000 people from the Indian diaspora were due to attend. On Saturday, the prime minister toured electric carmaker Tesla and met top tech CEOs, including Google’s Sundar Pichai and Apple’s Tim Cook.On Monday, Modi was scheduled to return to the United Nations in New York, where he was expected to meet President Obama.

On one side, Konami’sPES, and on the other, EA’sFifa.PES 2016arrives slightly earlier this time around, and there’s no doubt it is a very solid football game. It delivers exciting matches, and though the series has long been the footballer’s football game, it is today a title that knows just those moments when simulation should give way to the spirit of a captivating match.This newest iteration brings with it a bounty of modes, bolstered light management options, rather dazzling AI, and modestly understated presentation. The on-pitch action can feel a little lacking in physicality, but is rarely in intimacy or accuracy of controls.PES 2016also excels in making you play and think as a team, while still leaving ample space for individual flair. It should thrill both devotees and casual fans alike.WF

They made their displeasure clear with a night of strategic bombing. God only knows what they’d been gorging on, but they created a proper splatterfest. One of those you end up scraping at with a thumbnail. And I sort of agreed with them – not that I’d have expressed it in the same way.Some cars are so much more photogenic than others. In pictures the DS 5’s high bonnet and swirling chrome detailing give the impression of a nicely balanced vehicle, surging athletically up the road. But in the flesh it looks awkward: its bonnet and vast sweptback windscreen too big for its body, like one of those egg-headed dogs Princess Anne is so fond of.Rear view: the back of the DS 5, featuring the new logo and twin exhausts.I haven’t mentioned the C-word yet because, despite what you might think, this is no longer a Citroën. DS split from its parent company last year and its double chevron has now been replaced with a sinuous D kissing a flirty S.Launched 60 years on from the original DS, which still captivates with its curves and ingenuity, this DS probably won’t be celebrated in quite the same breathless way in 2075. However, DS is keen to establish itself as a constructor of premium cars which stand out from the crowd, and it has made every effort to combine ambitious styling with good comfort, dynamic technology and a decent engine.Step in and you’ll find an interior which is quirky and different, but not always in a good way. The seats are strikingly padded with leather blocks which look both retro and modern – especially in the Toffo-tan colour mine was. The dashboard is clutter-free thanks to half the buttons having migrated to a central strut overhead between the twin sunroofs (there’s also a third glass panel above the back seats). But rather than feeling light and airy, the interior feels oddly claustrophobic and unsettling.Inside story: the interior is light and airy thanks to the huge windscreen.The 1.6-litre BlueHDi diesel which I tested is economical and superbly quiet. You might be underwhelmed if you wanted to hare round corners, but on a long cruise it’s admirably unflustered and the fuel economy is excellent. The steering wheel feels big in your hands, which goes against the trend for smaller, sportier styles.Speed bumps are a tiresome issue round me – though not for my wife, who happily slams over them, bouncing the rear axle sickeningly into the air.

The idea seems to be one from some dystopian novel: a world where every celebrity has their own internet channel, exhaustively promoting their brand to eager fans, who pay to tune in and watch their favourite stars selling themselves online.In truth, that future is already upon us. This month, four of the five Kardashian/Jenner sisters – Kim, Khloé, Kendall and Kylie – launched their ownsubscription-based digital hubsthrough media company Whalerock Industries. Fifth sister Kourtney’s hub is in the pipeline.The Kardashian channels, which are stuffed full of beauty advice (Kim), clothes and accessories to try (Kylie), fitness tips (Khloé) and travel and lifestyle inspiration (Kendall), are available online and as mobile apps, charging subscribers just under $3 a month. More than a million fans have signed up in the two weeks since their launch, withKylie’s app, which features the 18-year-old goofing around and recommending her favourite snacks (Oreos, Lucky Charms, Diet Coke and Strawberry Twizzlers, if you’re interested) proving particularly popular: it topped the Apple app store within hours of launching.That Kylie is the most adept at this new format should come as no surprise. As the youngest Kardashian-Jenner, she is a digital native who has grown up online and regularly talks to fans on Instagram and Twitter, on which she has 36.4 million and 11.5 million fans respectively. Asshe told technology site Wiredwhen her site launched: “[The app] is by far my favourite thing… I’m way more comfortable on [it] and I can just share what I want to share.”That last point is a particularly salient one in terms of what Whalerock Industries appears to be offering celebrities – the chance to cut out the middle man of old media and curate their own content. When the Kardashian/Jenners rose to fame, it was on the back of reality television, a genre now in freefall with ratings declining and a dearth of new hits coming through.Yet whileKeeping Up With the Kardashianspresented the illusion of life – with the family, tantrums, troubled love lives and all – it was, as is every scripted reality-TV show, driven by ratings and stage-managed by executives. The new digital hubs offer something different – after all, if your fans are paying to see your carefully chosen content, do you need a big splash in a celebrity magazine such asPeopleor even the higher-end brands such asVogue,ElleorVanity Fair?Khloe, left, and Kim Kardashian, second right, with their parents. The family were stars of their own reality TV show, Keeping up with the Kardashians.Photograph: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images“Celebrities are definitely extending their own brands online as a result of having the freedom to play with so many more platforms and to express themselves,” says digital journalist Emma Gannon, who founded popular bloggirllostinthecity.com. “Most famous people still do ‘mainstream’ work via big companies, but there is a lot to gain from having their own platform: whether that’s a blog, a newsletter or a YouTube channel, stars can have direct access to their audience like never before.”And for those who are prepared to offer the right mix of relatable “normality” and glamorous aspiration, the rewards could be huge. This is uncharted territory – a world in which the celebrity controls the content and the fans pay for the illusion of access and an insight in to their “real” world.Put another way, it’s the YouTube-isation of celebrity culture. When YouTubers such asZoe Sugg,PewDiePieandAlfie Deyesfirst rose to prominence, there was a lot of talk among branding and marketing companies about how to utilise their growing power, but the reality is that these new stars reach their fans without the need for huge campaigns and promotion. Earlier this month,Username: Evie, by Joe Sugg (Zoe’s brother and fellow YouTube star), which is described as being “created with help from writer Matt Whyman and illustrator Amrit Birdi”, became the fastest-selling graphic novel in the UK, entering the charts at number four.Anna Valentine, publishing director at Orion, believes that the current phenomenon is only scratching the surface. She is currently on tour with controversial YouTuber Olajide Olatunji, better known as KSI, promoting his bookI Am A Bellend, and says the tour has benefited from a strong interactive element, which included developing an app with exclusive content. “I do think an increasing number of celebrities will make the transition to YouTube,” she says. “YouTubers are generating more revenue through advertising and securing more lucrative brand partnerships than their counterparts in TV space.”Certainly, for a generation of teenagers, the likes ofJennie Jenkins,Patricia BrightandHazel Hayesare more famous than any A-List star. They relate to their “availability”, the way in which they are just like them, albeit with better hair and makeup skills and their own channels online. Last August, US magazineVarietycommissioned a survey on the popularity of various stars, only to discover the five most influential figures among Americans aged 13 to 18 were all YouTube stars, with the teenagers singling out the YouTubers’ “candid sense of humour, lack of filter and risk-taking spirit” as the reason for their appeal.Small wonder, then, that other celebrities are dipping cautious toes in these sparkling new waters. A report in theNew York Timessuggested that Whalerockhopes to “create app-based channels for 12-to-20 performers and brands by 2018”. It has already launched an app with rapper Tyler, the Creator, and is working on one with veteran shock jock Howard Stern. As the Wired piece about the Kardashians noted: “Social media has made it easier for [stars] to promote their causes on Twitter, but what if they no longer neededVanity Fairfor photoshoots? Or a production company for their films? So far, the internet remains complementary – one part of the Hollywood PR machine, not the main distributor – but that could change.”Cara Delevingne self-promotes to fans via a variety of social media.Photograph: Allstar/20th Century FoxLeading that change are the younger stars, who truly feel at home with the medium. While the likes of Cara Delevingne have long used social media to share intimate details of their lives with fans, increasingly a more vocal presence is called for. Thus model Karlie Kloss has a YouTube channel,Klossy, which aims to take fans backstage in her life “to the things you didn’t get to see before”, something which, in reality, translates to goofy videos made backstage during various fashion weeks and quick trawls through Kloss’s world travels. Meanwhile, this monthGame of Thrones’ starMaisie Williams launched her own channel, the winningly titled Random Moments of Madness With Maisie Williams, saying in her opening post: “I have a lot of friends who are in YouTube and I just find it really, really interesting what they do and thought I’d give it a shot myself.” Williams’s channel, in contrast to the slick Kardashian sites, is promoted as an irregular slot on which she’ll post “videos and sketches, stuff that pops into my mind”. Yet it’s as much about the brand as Kylie Jenner’s more polished hub.“Personal branding can be dismissed as a negative thing, due to all the corporate jargon surrounding it,” says Gannon. “But having your own personal brand is the way the world is going. Internet profiles have meant we’re all building online personas; you are selling yourself as a brand every day, even if you’re not aware of it through your cover photo, your opinions, your photos, your friends, your Instagram feed.”The erosion of traditional media is beginning to open the doors for talented artists who might have struggled to be heard. More than 200,000 people subscribe to actor and writerIssa Rae’s YouTube channeland her videos, including her hugely acclaimed web seriesAwkward Black Girl,have been viewed more than 2 million times. Rae landed a TV deal with HBO on the back of that success.Insecure, about a woman on the verge of turning 30, was approved for development last December, although Rae has talked of her frustration at the time it has taken to turn this project around compared with making shows in her bedroom.It’s this sense that you’re almost in the bedroom with the person you’re watching that companies are so keen to pin down, not least because it’s a potentially lucrative source of advertising and money. The Kardashian hubs are filled with their recommendations for all kinds of products, and the hope is, presumably, that fans will jump on those suggestions and buy them.“I often think the Kardashians are the queens of native advertising,” says Gannon. “They are seamless at selling themselves, and selling while they do it. They sell without you noticing and no one minds because they are so interesting to follow, apparently. It’s just an extension of their brand and their personality.”However, celebrities eager to sign up to this revolution should be wary. “A note of caution,” says Valentine. “The reason YouTubers are building such huge audiences is that they’re wholly authentic. They’re producing content they love, content they know subscribers will engage with. It’s a genuine transaction. Viewers can see through videos that are thinly veiled adverts … only those who produce brilliant content will rise to the top.”
When news broke that the publishers of fantasy card gameMagic: The Gatheringwere working on a board game set in the series’ fictional universe, fans reacted with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. In the 22 years since it was first released, the game has hooked an estimated 20m players with its blend of compelling storylines and strategic gameplay. A poorly-executed adaptation would leave a lot of people disappointed.Fortunately, Arena of the Planeswalkers may be the best tabletop game released this year.A fast-paced skirmish battle game, it sees you and your friends take command of armies of creatures led by “planeswalkers”, the powerful, dimension-hopping mages who serve as the central characters in Magic’s ongoing plot. Over the course of about an hour, you’ll summon units to the modular hex-grid battlefield, engage in vicious combat and cast deadly spells in an effort to slay your rivals and emerge as the last man, woman or woodland elf standing.It’s all very dramatic, but Arena of the Planeswalkers actually starts out as quite a low-key affair. Each player begins the game in command of just a single character – their planeswalker – represented on the battlefield by a miniature plastic figure. As the game progresses, you’ll summon more creatures to join the fight, until the board becomes a glorious, swirling, chaotic melee.Each unit you bring to the fray is accompanied by a card outlining its abilities – the number of spaces it can move, the amount of damage it can endure and its skill in attacking and defending in combat. But as well as these basic stats, each unit boasts special powers allowing it to do things that others can’t. The red player’s “firecats” can move and attack as soon as they’re summoned on to the board, making them an immediate threat. The blue player’s phantoms can move through enemy figures as if they weren’t there. The black player’s zombies smell so bad that any enemies who come near them suffer a penalty to their defence rolls.Game-changing spellsUsing these abilities to their best effect is a huge part of the game, but you’ll also have a collection of magical spells at your disposal, represented by a personal deck of cards. You’ll draw one of these at the start of every turn, and they can affect the battle in a number of potentially game-changing ways. Some simply deal damage to opposing creatures, others beef up your own troops’ abilities, or disrupt your opponent’s plans by countering their spells or forcing them to discard cards from their hand.Individually, none of these spells are necessarily all that powerful, but play them at just the right moment, or in just the right combination, and they can completely change the course of the game. In this respect, Arena of the Planeswalkers is much like its card-based older sibling. You can conceive and execute a winning strategy, only for your opponent to play a masterful turn leaving your forces in tatters as you desperately try to improvise a plan B.Arena of the Planeswalkers’ plastic miniatures are a disappointing aesthetic failure in an otherwise excellent game.Photograph: Owen Duffy for the GuardianAll of this happens at a pretty blistering pace. The board quickly fills up with opposing units, and there is minimal preliminary manoeuvring, leaving you to get straight down to some thoroughly satisfying combat. The turn structure itself also keeps the game moving along quickly, with each player activating, moving and fighting with just a single one of their units on any given round, meaning that a complete turn rarely takes more than about a minute.This means you’re never waiting long for your next turn to come around, even with four or five players at the table. But it also throws up some interesting tactical dilemmas. Often you’ll find yourself with two or three situations on the board which all require your attention at the same time. Knowing which crisis you have to deal with right now and which can wait one more turn can mean the difference between victory and defeat.Like someone failed at using a 3D printerThis is an astonishingly good game. It’s easy to learn, but packs genuine depth. The dice-based combat system is simple and intuitive, and multiplayer games in particular are an anarchic, violent joy with players forging alliances and stabbing one another in the back with each passing turn.It’s also impressive just how faithfully the game adheres to the theme and flavour of the Magic universe. Each army feels very different to command. Where the white faction specialises in disciplined, coordinated attacks, red prefers to rush in with lightning-fast early assaults, lobbing fireballs at anything that survives. Where green units thrive on their affinity with nature and the survival of the fittest, the black army corrupts and weakens opponents before wiping them out with a tide of reanimated undead horrors.But while Arena of the Planeswalkers does so many things well, it does have one glaring weakness.The plastic figures included in the box are among the worst components I’ve ever seen in a board game. They’re god-awful, like someone’s failed first attempt at using a 3D printer. This would be offputting in any game, but in one based on a franchise that’s given us some of the most beautiful fantasy artwork in all of gaming, it’s a near-unforgivable oversight.It’s the kind of production mis-step that could conceivably cause people to overlook the game, and that would be a pity, because it’s a joy to play. It’s also a game that’s going to grow. The core boxed set, which sells for £29.99, comes with five small squads that have clearly been carefully balanced against one another. But an ongoing series of expansions will offer new commanders, units, settings and scenarios, allowing players to construct their own personalised armies and spell decks and develop new strategies in the months and years to come.This is a game to get your teeth into, and one that could easily become an obsession. Whether you’re a player of its trading-card predecessor or not, this is a must-play for any strategy fan.
The Kia Sorento is the kind of car that will cause acquaintances to ask, “What are you driving now?” when you arrive. If you like that kind of thing – and God knows, I love it – you’ll burst with pride. It has a slightly militaristic exterior, more imposing in black, I should think; in white more redolent of plain money. It’s long, wide and low, spacious inside, bullish on the road. There are potentially three rows of seats, though I never needed them and left the boot as was. As low as it is, the boot is an extremely high jump for an elderly dog, not that I would ever put a dog in his twilight years in a review car, oh no.City driving, as with anything not designed for a city but that city people love to drive, is not ideal: it’s sluggish in the lower gears. If you’re in first and second a lot, you may feel vexed by the effort. But cruising is a pleasure: give it an A road or a motorway and it will take care of itself. The acceleration is confident, the steering is true, the traction is reassuring, the handling invites trust, the leather seats make you feel as though everything’s going to be OK.The driving position is well thought-out, everywhere from the posture to the armrest. The room in the cabin really tells if you’re one of those people who lurches into a car with two litres of water and a load of handheld devices you forgot to charge. The satnav, from its classy 8in screen to the intuitiveness of its controls, is a pleasure: it is one of the injustices of the world of cars that you feel moved to comment on satnav only if it sucks. Then, once in a while, it’s great, and you remember to mention it.It is the first time, by popular lore, Kia has ever come up with anything you’d want to spend 30 grand on, so they’re naturally pretty proud. 0-62mph in nine seconds is quite fun, though you never feel as though you’re taking off. It has the safety features du jour, which revolve mainly around an insane number of airbags and a lot of alarms – blind spot, lane discipline and rear cross traffic alert (this translates in the real world into a noise you don’t understand, until the hazard passes you or recedes) – and the fuel consumption is decent.The question is, would you fall in love with it? If you think of SUVs as a bid for status, then a moderately priced one would seem pointless. But if you genuinely need a giant car that a dog can’t get into or out of, then it’s a good, solid, novel entry into the class.Kia Sorento: in numbersPrice£35,845Top speed124mphAcceleration0-60mph in 9 secondsCombined fuel consumption46.3mpgCO2emissions161g/kmCool rating7/10Eco rating6/10
For the second time in less than three years, Google is under investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over antitrust concerns, Bloomberg reported Friday morning.The inquiry will look into whether the company’s Android operating system has violated antitrust laws by privileging its own products and services over its competitors’ to an untenable degree, according tothe Bloomberg report, which cited competing tech company executives who had complained about Google to the commission.Both the FTC and Google declined to comment, the former saying that it does not comment “on an investigation or the existence of an investigation”.Google has been the target of several recent complaints, many to do with its advertising networks – a business worth an estimated $5bn according to industry analyst Brian Weiser. A European company called Disconnect complained to the European Commission (EC) earlier this year that its app, which isolated search functions like Google’s from Google’s trackers, had been repeatedly thrown out of Google’s app store.Others have voiced concerns to the FTC over the company’s YouTube Kids app, which they sayunfairly exposes children to targeted advertisingfor unhealthy food, among others.Google is currently under investigationby the European Commission, as well. European antitrust laws are less lenient that American rules, said NYU law professor Eleanor Fox, whose focus is trade regulation.In an investigation into anticompetitive behavior, the FTC “would have to prove that [Google’s] conduct creates or increases market power”, said Fox. “In the EU, it’s a level playing field argument, and a competition on the merits argument. The US says that’s not enough. You have to go further and prove that prices will go up and that less will be produced.” With relationship to advertising, Fox said, those arguments are abstract and hard to make.The FTC investigated Microsoft in 1993 over misuse of its market share through product bundling; that investigation closed but the Department of Justice then sued the company in 1998 over the same concerns, specifically its promotion of its own Internet Explorer over Netscape Navigator.More recently, the FTC voted 5-0 inearly 2013to cease investigating the company (citing lack of evidence), but not until Googlehad agreedto change business practices including restricting access to advertising platforms that compete with the company’s own.
Uber, the under-fire taxi-hailing app, has hit out at London’s transport regulator, Transport for London (TfL), for taking it to the high court on Monday in the latest threat to its explosive growth in the London taxi market.The high court case, which will determine whether the Uber app breaks the law by effectively acting as a meter, is piling on the pressure for the ride-hailing firm.Uber, which is backed by investors including Wall Street institution Goldman Sachs, is already facing the threat of a major crackdown on its business practices in London followingthe announcement earlier this week of a public consultation.Related:Uber fights back with petition after TfL launches consultationAn Uber spokesman said on Thursday: “The proposals, and the court case, are designed to protect the black-cab industry rather than help them adapt to what people want.”TfL, which provisionally took the view that Uber’s app was lawful, subsequently referred that decision to the court. “The court will be dealing with what is a distinguishing part of the Uber offering,” said Liam Griffin, chief executive of Europe’s biggest minicab firm, Addison Lee. “This court case could potentially have a devastating effect on Uber’s London business,” he added.Uber is said to be confident it can survive a defeat in the high court. However, it is concerned that, if the case goes against them, it might need to make changes to the way its app operates that will make it less user friendly.The legal spat over whether the Uber app breaches the law comes towards the end of a tough week for the firm, which has 18,000 drivers (called registered partners) in the capital.In London, the group was shellshocked by TfL’s decision to consider new proposals – including making passengers wait at least five minutes for a ride – after talks with the rest of the industry.Related:Why won't Boris Johnson let Uber break the cab 'cartel'? Votes, maybe?The firm is facing problems in countries all over the worldas it disrupts existing taxi services. In France, two of Uber’s executives were in court to face criminal charges of illegally organising taxi services through the company’s low-cost UberPop service. The trial has been delayed until mid-February so that both sides can review more data.In the Netherlands on Tuesday, the group’s Amsterdam offices were raided as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into whether it is violating the country’s laws over a super-cheap service using untrained drivers. On the same day, in Rio de Janeiro, Uber and other similar smartphone taxi apps were banned from operating.London’s black-cab operators, who number more than 25,000, have long been arguing they want Uber to face tougher regulations so that the competition can be fairer. Uber, meanwhile, is arguing that regulation of the whole industry should be reduced, while adhering to tough safety standards.The black-cab drivers were given a boost yesterday when Hailo, an app firm, signed a new deal that boosts their tech offering in the battle against Uber. The black cabs have other app deals, with groups such as Gett and TaxiToo.Uber has launched a petition, which has so far attracted nearly 120,000 names, to support its fight against the new TfL proposals in London. It says: “These rules make no sense”.Related:Want a cheap Uber taxi? Wait till no one else wants one“We understand that black-cab drivers are feeling the pressure from services like Uber,” the petition states. “But the answer is to level the playing field by reducing today’s burdensome black-cab regulations – not to introduce rules that will be bad for riders, drivers and London.”TfL is chaired by Boris Johnson, who only two weeks ago branded black-taxi drivers as luddites. Yesterday, seven London Tory councillors, led by Peter Cuthbertson, asked Johnson to “think again” on Uber, concerned that his relatively relaxed view about the firm was changing.Cuthbertson told the Guardian: “There are some concerns with Uber, such as its policy on insurance, but these proposals don’t look at that. It’s almost like they’ve asked what are the key features of Uber that people like and how do we make them illegal?”Johnson is said to be worried by the increased number of minicabs in the capital and the congestion this is causing. The number of licensed private hire vehicles has gone from around 35,000 in 2005 to just over 60,000 now.Simon Walker, director general of the business-friendly Institute of Directors, has appealed to Johnson to uphold his free market ideals over the situation.This article was amended on 2 October
The question is the usual: PC or Mac? I am a very normal PC user. My daughter says “when you try Mac, you never come back”. I bought an iPhone 5c and sold it after two months …UgoThat’s a very unusual question nowadays, but the stock answer remains the same: pick the one that does what you want at a price you are willing to pay. Since you don’t appear to have any specific requirements, and you haven’t given me a budget, you will have to decide. Your money, your choice.However, people tend to like what they know, and they are generally averse to change. If you are “a very normal PC user” then switching to Mac OS X would involve some relearning. (Of course, it’s the same for Mac users going the other way, which – despite your daughter’s claim – some do.)Switching costsIf you were starting from scratch, you’d have nothing to lose. As a PC user, however, switching involves giving up whatever Windows expertise you have and investing time in learning a new system. Whether this matters depends on how well you know Windows.The switching costs include finding new programs to replace whatever you’re using on Windows, and importing your old data into your new system. This can prevent businesses from switching, and it can make life difficult for hobbyists with special interest software that Macs lack.On the other hand, it may be a non-issue for most ordinary consumers, because of the trend towards web services. The more things you do online in a browser, the simpler it is to switch platforms.There’s also a financial cost to switching, because the average Windows machine is much cheaper than the average Mac, especially if you factor in the cost of AppleCare. Of course, the extra cash does buy you a faster, better-made machine, as it should. But you may be paying for features you don’t need, or can’t really afford. A £150-£350 laptop might meet your needs, but Apple doesn’t sell laptops at those prices.Of course, there are also benefits to switching. For example, Macs require less maintenance than PCs, and are generally easier to update. (Whether Windows 10’s continuous updates will remove this advantage remains to be seen.) Also, Mac OS X is not a major target for a large, criminal malware industry. These benefits are somewhat hard to quantify, but they are real.Hardware optionsAlthough Macs are a viable alternative, most people will still buy Windows machines most of the time. Partly this is because Windows machines are cheaper. Partly it’s because Windows offers a wider range of choices from a bigger range of companies for a broader range of uses. PC companies offer everything from PCs on USB sticks to vast server farms. Indeed, several PC manufacturers offer whole ranges of PCs for different users, including budget buyers, consumers, high-end consumers, gamers,SOHOusers, enterprises, technical users and so on. Dell, for example, offers the Inspiron, XPS, Alienware, Vostro, Latitude, Optiplex and Precision ranges custom-designed for these different markets.Finally, there are several popular PC formats with no Mac equivalents. These include 2-in-1s that double as laptops and tablets, touch-screen PCs with high-resolution stylus/pen input, and expandable tower systems. With Windows, you can also have a PC built to order, or build your own with the help of websites likePCPartPicker.Think about your current PC use, and whether a different type of machine would suit you better. You may decide to stick with a traditional clamshell design, but it’s worth considering alternatives now, and what you might need in the future.The whole productThe vast range of options is one of the most valuable things about the Windows ecosystem, even if you only buy one PC. It’s part of what marketing strategists call“the whole product”.In marketing terms, “the whole product” consists of the core product (in this case, a PC) plus things like service and support (the expected product), add-ons such as software and peripherals (the augmented product), and expected future developments (the potential product).For example, when you buy a Windows PC, you are also buying the ability to use thousands of peripherals, hundreds of thousands of applications, plus all the Windows magazines, books, YouTube videos, websites and allied services from educational courses to repair shops. You are buying the ability to switch to a different manufacturer if your current supplier stops innovating or goes bust, and the reliable expectation that you will be able to buy an improved product in the future.Historically, the Windows PC has almost always been a better “whole product” than the Mac, regardless of the quality of individual devices. The interesting question is what kind of “whole product” Apple and Microsoft are building for the future.Future platformsWe know what Microsoft is doing. First, it is converging its three platforms – Windows, Windows Phone and the Xbox One games console – on a single operating system with universal apps that run on all three screens: phone, PC and TV. (This is a programming platform: it doesn’t mean they should have the same user interface.) Users can store their data anywhere, but keeping it in the cloud makes it accessible to all the different devices.Second, Microsoft is extending its reach across its rivals’ platforms, starting with Office 365. Microsoft now offers dozens of apps not just for Windows and Windows Phone, but also for Apple iPhones and iPads, and for Google Android smartphones and tablets. Microsoft is a software company, and wants its software on every popular device.We don’t really know what Apple is doing, because it doesn’t tell us. However, it makes most of its money from selling devices – mostly from selling iPhones – and generally isn’t interested in software unless it increases its hardware sales. (For example, Apple only ported iTunes to Windows in order to sell iPods.)Apple’s “whole product” is therefore focused on Apple hardware. It’s building a platform where Apple devices work together, rather than with other people’s. You can see the trend with Mac OS X becoming more like iOS, and withContinuityin Mac OS X Yosemite increasing the integration between Macs and iOS devices.Continuity’s features must be very useful if you own a Mac and an iPhone, but it means giving a lot of power – and a lot of money – to one company. Many people are happy to have Apple operating as a gatekeeper controlling innovation, and they are perfectly entitled to make that choice. But I want to use products from all the big ecosystems – including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft – so I’m not.You don’t say why you got rid of your iPhone 5c, but according to the “halo effect” theory, owning an iPhone is supposed to inspire you to buy other Apple products. If that didn’t work, it might be the wrong ecosystem for you. To find out, perhaps your daughter should lend you hers....Have you got another question for Jack? Email it toAsk.Jack@theguardian.com
Changes to the Consumer Rights Act have come into effect in the UK today, and with key amendments designed to deal with software purchases and digital goods, there are some important gains for gamers.Most obvious is the provision of a clear 30-day period in which consumers can return goods that they deem to be faulty, and ask for a refund or a replacement. In the past, the act ambiguously required that goods needed to be returned within a “reasonable time”, which allowed more wriggle room for retailers, who could also insist on just offering a repair.The act makes clear that goods must be fit for purpose and “free from minor defects”. With an increasing number of major games now being released with significant technical issues – including the likes of Battlefield 4, SimCity and the PC version of Batman: Arkham Knight – consumers will now be in a much stronger position to request a refund from the supplier of the game if it won’t load or can’t access online features.“The reasonable time has been clarified, which is good,” says Alex Tutty of entertainment law firm, Sheridans. “Retailers previously relied on this – especially if you think about a game that can be completed in 10 hours; they would say ‘you can’t return this after 20 days’.”The act applies, not just to physical boxed game releases from online or highstreet stores, but to digital games purchased from online sites like Steam, Origin, or the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network stores. Most of these have refund policies in place, but the new act makes their specific responsibilities much clearer. Titles will have to match the descriptions given on the website and be fit for the indicated purpose.“The update clarifies that the sale of goods act will now apply to digital products,” says Tutty. “Previously you had more rights if you bought a game on disc, now you get the benefit of that even if you’re buying digitally. From 1 October, anything you download has to be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose and meet the description that’s given. If you download a game and it’s bug-ridden, you can demand a refund and quote the sale of goods act. Before this, it wasn’t especially clear cut.”The act also covers free-to-download games. There is obviously no refund potential on the title itself but virtual goods, such as customised characters or new maps and levels, will be covered by the act and users will be able to demand refunds on unsatisfactory in-game purchases.Early releases and day one disastersThe new ruling also allows for the growing number of titles now released in unfinished or “beta” form, through services like Steam Early Access. “If you do indicate to people that the game is going to be buggy, that is allowed,” says Tutty. “But the act will allow people to get a refund on games that are released as full titles, yet are filled with bugs and don’t work.”So how will this affect those big day one releases, especially multiplayer games, where players want to get online and start levelling up their characters as soon as possible – but find that the code is broken or the servers have collapsed? “There are two remedies under the act,” says Tutty. “The right to repair or replacement, or the right to a price reduction up to a full refund if a repair or replacement is not possible within a reasonable time. So a company could possibly say, ‘well, we’ve got a patch coming that will fix it pretty quickly’. That’s a repair.”“However, where it gets quite interesting is that lots of people really want to play on day one – that’s a key selling point, especially when you get these exclusive deals where a certain map pack may be available first on a specific platform – well, presumably you’ve bought that game because you want to play it online, on day one, against your mates.”Pre-orders have become a contentious area of the games industry, with a greater number of publishers and retailers looking to get players to commit to a purchase before the final release. Tutty believes that the new act may mean that these customers find they have more power to ask for a refund if the final game doesn’t live up to early promises given on the pre-order page.He explains: “If the company says, this is how the game is going to work, and later they pivot and say, actually it will be slightly different, players could complain that, well I bought it under the belief it was going to be something else, so I want a refund.”So could the changes to the consumer act – which only applies in Britain – lead to any significant changes in how major games get released? It’s possible. Although the UK is only one market, games revenue was £4bn last year, making it second only to Germany in the European sector. Britain also boasts a large development community and is home to some of the most highly subscribed, vocal and influential YouTubers. “If I was a games publisher I would be more mindful now of releasing buggy products,” says Tutty. “I think the quality assurance process is really going to have to ramp back up. It should make things better.”In an age where publishers are relying ever more heavily on bug-fixing patches, as well as on post-release downloadable content such as DLC and virtual goods, the relationship with gamers is becoming much clearer – and the responsibilities more rigorously defined. Although it is the supplier, not the game publisher, that will be responsible for providing refunds or replacements, it seems there’s going to be much greater pressure throughout the pipeline – from developer to consumer – to get things right first time.
Can you hear me now? Not if you’re eavesdropping on a Blackphone. Privacy company Silent Circle has released a second version of its signature handheld, a smartphone designed to quell the data scraping and web tracking that’s become such an integral part of the digital economy in the last few years (and whose resultsmight well end up with the NSA, if the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act passes).Silent Circle is the brainchild of the inventor of the modestly named “Pretty Good Privacy” (PGP) encryption, Phil Zimmermann, and former Navy Seal Team Six sniper Mike Janke. In the beginning, Janke said, the Blackphone project was just a way for people working for his security firmSOC, since sold, to call home without having their communications intercepted. With its newer and easier to use model, it’s seeking industry clients in addition to individual security wonks.“I began going around from Silicon Valley to Germany to Spain, and there just wasn’t anything,” Janke said. “I went Nato, I went to the US, to the British governments, and they all said, ‘No, we don’t know of anything,’ and I said, ‘Come on, you’ve got to have some super-secret tech,’ and they said, ‘No, it’s a big problem for us.’”So Janke, who remembered using PGP as a Seal, sought out Zimmermann and went to work. Now, as the new iPhone and Samsung models hit the market, the Switzerland-based company, which runs a heavily modified version of Google’s Android mobile operating system, finally has support from Google.Google didn’t support the initial software build, something that probably helped make the phone more popular, rather than less, with people concerned about NSA backdoors and data leakage. But now the tech giant is trying to break into the business software market, and that’s a sector that Silent Circle, with its subscription-based business model, has its sights set on. (The subscriptions to secure call and messaging apps that come with the Blackphone run out after a year.)The new operating system is “about 20% Lollipop”, said CEO, Bill Conner, referring to the Android version Blackphone currently uses.Google support is a relief to Silent Circle – in the previous version of the phone, users couldn’t download anything from the Google Play store and had to manage installation through web downloads or an old-fashioned hardware connection. The new version lets users download whatever they want and tweak its access to your data as you see fit in much the way the iPhone does – a feature Google-distributed builds of Android have notably avoided over the years.Blackphone is encrypted end to end, if both people on the line are using either the phone itself or Silent Circle’s call and messaging apps. If someone tries to break into a Blackphone call, they’ll get a notification and the call will drop.“But let’s say I have my Blackphone and I left my jacket at a hotel in Paris and they have a big, old landline and I’m calling from New York,” said Janke.“I dial their number and I’m encrypted all the way from New York to the Paris public switch telephone network, and then I’m open to them,” he explained. “It’s either encrypted completely end-to-end, or encrypted to the public switch network and then open from there.”Janke said he still hopes Google will adopt some of Silent Circle’s own features: “We hope that Google will federate some of the capabilities [of our phone],” he said. “They’ve got [support for multiple personas] in Android that’s coming out now. The problem with it is that it still leaves data across those spaces and the spaces aren’t segregated all the way down to the chip.”
RIP the static profile pic. Facebook has reincarnated the highlight/lowlight (depending on your tolerance for flashy things on the internet) of early 2000s’ social media: animated profile pics are back.Such avatars, which became all to common to the MySpace generation through liberal use of animated gifs, have largely been absent in subsequent social networks even as the file format has undergone a resurgence.But Facebook’s new profile videos – several seconds of video which is essentially 2015’s equivalent of an animated gif – can be uploaded from the Facebook iPhone app toannoydelighteveryone.Once recorded and uploaded they’ll only animate if someone visits your profile, not in everyone’s newsfeed – yet.“Profile videos will let [you] show a part of yourself you couldn’t before, and add a new dimension to your profile,” said Facebook ina blog postannouncing the change.Facebook’s new profile videos.Profile photos can also be set as temporary images for certain events, reverting back to your standard pouty smizing face once the World Cup, or whatever else has proved cause for a novelty overlay, has ended.“It can be a visual status update to let your friends know what’s going on in your life today, or it can be your statement of solidarity for a cause you feel strongly about,” said Facebook. Cue painted faces and flags.Both profile photos and videos are now bigger and centred on the page making them harder to ignore.The new profile videos can only be uploaded via the Facebook app for iPhones, and only for users in the UK and California for now. Despite being exclusive to Apple’s iOS at the moment, Apple’s new Live Photos aren’t supported.The Guardian’s Jonathan Haynes illustrates why Facebook’s new video profile pictures may be a terribly bad idea.Facebook profiles also now have a small space just under the action buttons for people to write whatever they like, just like Twitter’s bios. Emojis, words, missives or an actual biography are all welcome, as are up to five featured photos.Anyone who can see your profile on Facebook will be able to see the new bio space. Other information on your profile can be shown or not based on extensive criteria around friends, friends of friends, public and so on.Facebook suffers second outage in a week – and users vent on TwitterFacebook joins YouTube in showing 360-degree videos – including Star WarsFacebook accused of spying on Belgian citizens like the NSA
In life, there are things you just know you shouldn’t do. Never eat the yellow snow. Never trust anyone who is rude to waiters. Never take on one last job before retirement. And, of course, the golden rule: never, ever go on Grand Designs if you don’t really know what you want, where you want it and whether or not you have the budget to build it anyway.Grand Designs is a show in which Kevin McCloud joins a series of couples as their ambitious home-building plans are crushed beneath the caterpillar tracks of fortune. Every single episode follows the same plot. A happy couple describes their perfect house, Kevin raises his eyebrows, then they embark on the project anyway. A year passes – then we see the couple, now a shadow of their former selves, squatting in a concrete house-shell, taking it in turns to wash themselves in a stagnant puddle. For some reason, they always decide to have a baby at this point. Then Kevin says: “I told you so”. This makes for entertaining viewing.I’m talking about Grand Designs for two reasons. The first is because it delivers excellent schadenfreude. The second is that I am reviewing Happy Home Designer, a game in which you design homes for idiots. See the parallels?The basic premise is this: in a world where animals live in houses, you have been chosen to decorate those houses. Unlike Kevin McCloud, you have almost complete creative freedom – but the animals, your clients, ask you to make sure their two or three pieces of furniture are worked into the design somewhere.No problem, right? You start off your career with a spring in your step, as Kevin himself probably did before the years of working with naive middle-class numpties took their toll. “I want a gothic palace,” your clients bleat. “I loooove polka dots.” You take their briefs and create their perfect homes – though with the amount of freedom you’re given, it’s more likeyourideal home, despite the fact you don’t ever get given your own to decorate. Maybe you just live in your car.With the passing of time (and the spending of Play Coins), your responsibilities increase. One day you’ll get to choose wall decorations; the next, you can design the entire garden.It’s a vast improvement on the home designing elements in the otherwise excellent Animal Crossing: New Leaf, with more stuff, more options, more features – and a much better interface for actually positioning the furniture, moving from fiddly sofa-dragging to a simpler top-down grid that allows you to select, drop and rotate with the stylus. It’s so easy, Kirsty Allsopp could do it.Related:Animal Crossing: New Leaf – reviewThere’s a huge selection of furniture at your fingertips, allowing you to create just about anything you can imagine. The tiny room size both limits and hones your creativity – at least at first – and the animals’ requested themes give you direction, so you’re not left floundering. This catalogue is easily the most well-designed bit of Happy Home Designer, even if the menu layout is frustratingly ambiguous.The town design is also at your command, with the help of lovely Isabelle. You’ll start by plonking down shops and restaurants, later moving on to schools and a hospital without ever having to understand or learn what a hospital actually needs in order to keep its patients alive. Just bung in an operating table or two, and trust that the power of whimsy will keep them all going for now.With your input, the town turns from a cartoon recreation of Watford into somewhere you’d want to live. The buildings bustle with simulated life, but it all feels like you’re on the wrong side of the goldfish bowl. You can’t really interact with anything – you can’t shop or drink coffee, and the residents won’t say much more than a sentence to you. It’s then that the cute veneer starts to wear down to reveal the vapidity beneath.Happy Home Designer, a game with a much smaller premise than New Leaf, keeps up a similar rate of progress to its predecessor, but tails off about 10-15 hours in. No fishing, no bug catching, no fossil finding, no real friendships… just home decoration. Sure, that’s implied by the title, but it just ends up feeling like your poor home designer has no life. At this point, you might – like me – start phoning it in.Do you have to use this ugly furniture? Yes. Sorry. What happens if you don’t put anything else in, then? Nothing. They still think you did a great job. Okay, then, what happens if you run completely wild? Well, you could take the “TV studio” brief and turn it into something a little more … adult. No one seems to mind. Or notice.Just like the numpties on Grand Designs, Happy Home Designer doesn’t really know what it wants, and it suffers for it. It can’t possibly be the newest Animal Crossing – it’s far too small. It’s a pretty good, if simple, home decorating game, but not as a full, standalone release. It’s a life simulator that doesn’t let you have a life. If this were an episode of Grand Designs, and I was Kevin McCloud, I’d turn to the camera right now, and say: “Well, it’s not quite what we all wanted, but … I guess it’ll do.” Roll eyes. Roll credits.
In our modern world, where there are online reviews for everything from specific brands of ballpoint pen to specific shades of eyeshadow, buyer’s remorse should be a thing of the past. There are no mistakes; only lack of research.Those who won’t go to a play, buy a new phone, or eat at an unfamiliar restaurant without reading what others had to say about their experience first might be early adopters of Peeple, a user-review site like Yelp – but for human beings.Related:Yelp CEO talks mobile growth, global expansion... and doner kebabsSubtitled “character is destiny”, Peeple is an upcoming app that promises to “revolutionise the way we’re seen in the world through our relationships” by allowing you to assign reviews of one to five stars to everyone you know.“The Peeple app allows us to better choose who we hire, do business with, date, become our neighbours, roommates, landlords/tenants, and teach our children,”runs the blurb. “There are endless reasons as to why we would want this reference check for the people around us.”It is the brainchild of a Canadian marketer, Julia Cordray, and her Californian co-founder, Nicole McCullough, who describe it as a “positivity app for positive people”.The Washington Post reportsthat the company’s shares were valued at US$7.6m on Monday, and that Cordray and McCullough are pitching for more investment. (Many of theshareholders profiledon Peeple’s website have personal relationships with Cordray.)To join the service – which is being beta tested – you must be at least 21 and have an established Facebook account. All reviews you write appear under your real name, and are contextualised in one of three categories: personal, professional or romantic. You can improve your public “positivity rating” by writing more positive reviews than negative ones.To add someone new to the site’s database, you must have their mobile phone number. Positive reviews post immediately; reviews of two stars or fewer are sent to the subject’s private inbox, from which point you have 48 hours to “work it out with the user”: “If you cannot turn a negative into a positive the comment will go live and then you can publicly defend yourself.”Reviews will also expire after a year, to reflect people’s capacity to “grow and change for the better”.How do I opt out pre-emptively?Facebook commentAlthough users can report any write-ups they believe are inaccurate or violate Peeple’s terms and conditions, they cannot delete reviews. If you do not join Peeple, and thus can’t contest those negative ratings, your profile shows only positive ones.It sounds like a moderating – not to mention legal – minefield, and early media stories have been sceptical. (The development of a similar service, MeowMeowBeenz, and the social breakdown that ensues is the plotof one episodeof the sitcom Community.)“I’m really looking forward to being able to air all of my personal grievances, all from the safety of my phone,” wrote columnist Mike Morrison inan opinion piecethat was later rebutted point-by-pointon Peeple’s Facebook page.In an update titled “An Ode to Courage” posted prominently on Peeple’s home page, Cordray and McCullough say they refuse to apologise for being “bold innovators … because we love you enough to give you this gift … whether you love us or our concept or not”.On Thursday Cordray told the Guardian that Peeple had been “misrepresented by media”. When signing up, users must agree to an extensive list of terms and conditions intended to prevent shaming or bullying.These include “profanity, bullying, health references, disability references, confidential information, mentioning other people in a rating that you are not currently writing a rating for, name calling, degrading comments, abuse, derogatory comments, sexual references, mention of confidential information, racism, legal references, hateful content, [and] sexism”.Users are also not allowed to review people they do not know.“We will be reviewing all negative reviews posted before they can go live and will have control over them,” said Cordray. “We will also be reviewing positive reviews to unclaimed profiles to ensure compliance [to the terms and conditions].”But the response to Peeple posted on its Facebook page suggests that, for many, this is not reassurance enough. “How do I opt out pre-emptively?” askedone commenter; a representative responded saying that “we have not made these decisions concrete yet nor have we launched our app”.An editedFacebook post published lateon Wednesday night further suggested that the terms and conditions of the app, and the way it functioned, were not yet set in stone.Currently, users are not allowed to remove themselves from Peeple’s database, but Cordray said this was under consideration: “No promises though as we want to hear from our Beta users and do what they would want since they would likely be our users.”She said Peeple would be launched in November “unless we change major features” – meaning you have at least one month to get into everyone’s good books.
1. Logging out of Facebook remotelyEver checked Facebook on a friend’s or family member’s device and then realised, with horror, that you forgot to log out? Never fear, there’s a simple, but little known, way to log out of your profile remotely. Navigate to “settings” using the drop-down in the right hand corner of your screen, then “security”, then “when you’re logged in”. From this screen, you will be able to close an open session, on whichever device it’s still running on.The Facebook page enabling remote logout.Photograph: Facebook2. Searching incomplete phrases on GoogleWhen trying to remember a particular quote, phrase, proverb or lyric, it’s often the case that we half-remember, missing words or skewing them slightly.A little known Google trick makes it much easier to identify them. Putting an asterisk in a quoted sentence will indicate that a word is missing (replaced with the asterisk). This makes it much more likely that the specific term you are looking for will be returned, rather than results which just happen to include the other words or rest of the sentence.For example: I want to identify the Foals’ songGive It Allby searching for the following lyric: “all that remains are words in the rain”, but let’s say I didn’t quite catch “words” or “rain”. If I were to just search for “all that remains are in the”, I would return search results on a band called All That Remains. If, however, I google “all that remains are * in the *” (including quotation marks),the Foals song will be returned in the results. Clever.3. Twitter soft blockTwitter has a pretty good function in themute button, which allows you to remain following an account but hides its tweets and retweets from your own timeline. It’s a great way of basically ridding a person from your Twitter experiencewithout offending them by unfollowing. (People do not know when you mute them. To mute: click on the cogwheel to the right of somebody’s profile.)This is what it would like if I muted my boss. 😏Photograph: Twitter screengrabHowever what you often really want is to mute someone from reading your tweets. Here there’s an unofficial option that can help, it’s known as “the soft block”. This is a sly means of forcing a person to unfollow you by blocking and immediately unblocking them. Once they are unfollowing, your tweets and retweets will no longer appear in their timeline. The hope is that you are less visible, and so drawing less engagement from this person. It’s a good way to manage stalkers and people who constantly favourite your tweets and slide into your mentions at every opportunity.If someone’s really keen, however, they will probably be manually checking in on your profile and realise, perplexed, that they are no longer following. In this case, blocking – or a polite word – is the only option.I just done my first soft block. These milestones&mdash; Helen (@givesyouHel)September 23, 20154. Incognito windowsIt’s worrying how many people don’t use incognito mode when browsing the internet. For anyone who does the kind of thing like spend seven minutes at work checking out how celebrities from the 1980s have aged, this is a must. Pretty much all major browsers offer incognito or private browsing mode, which means that a user’s previous activity will not be logged and stored in history.This isn’t just, as people assume, for looking at explicit or otherwise embarrassing content, but can prove useful when, for instance, searching for the other half’s birthday present or looking online for support for an issue you’d rather somebody didn’t stumble across in your browser history.Turning browsing history off does not make you anonymous on the internetHere’s how to browse privately using:Chrome,Firefox,SafariandInternet Explorer. ISPs (internet service providers) and sites themselves, however, will know when a site has been visited – so don’t think private browsing makes you anonymous on the internet. It doesn’t. You’d needTorfor that.5. Mute an email threadThere’s not much more annoying than an office email thread or a chain mail you’d wish you’d never opened. Luckily, there is a simple solution to such suffering. Email threads can, blissfully, thank you Lord, be muted. Using Gmail, click on the “more” tab at the top of the email, and then the mute option. In Outlook, the mute function can be found viathe home tab(the feature is called ignore in Outlook). Muted email threads can be unmuted should you ever want to (never) join back in.6. Use emoji on desktop webOf coursesomebody has devised an actual IRL emoji keyboard(well, fourteen actually, to fit all the emoji in, think giant mixing desk), but how do you go about writing emoji quickly and easily on desktop web?Most of us simply copy and paste emoji from sites such asgetemoji.comoriemoji.com, but there is a simpler way for both Mac and Windows users. In any open text field, simply presscommand and control and space togetheron Mac to bring up the emoji characters panel (using OS X 10.8 or later). On Windows computers, go to the task bar &gt; toolbar &gt; touch keyboard, and choose the smiley key. Unfortunately, the trick is onlycompatible with certain browsersaccording to the operating system you are running.What the pop-up emoji panel looks like on a Mac computer.Photograph: LifeHack7. Amuse yourself on GchatIf you are wedded to Gchat for intraoffice banter and are not au fait with all of theamazing shortcuts to produce silly animations, you’re in for a treat.

Play YouTube in slow motionThere are many fun tricks and tips, or easter eggs, to be found on YouTube. For instance, the ability toplay arcade games within viewer, but there is also a trick that is genuinely useful: playing videos in slow motion. It’s easier to spot yourself in the background of a TV vox pop that way. It’s incredibly simple: just hold down the space bar, and the video will start playing at a slower speed, perfect when it comes to grabbing the perfect screenshot of a particular moment (and here’s how to do thaton MacandPC). You’re welcome.9. Twitter shortcutsJust as Photoshoppers know that shortcuts are the cornerstone of productivity, avid tweeters know that shortcuts are your friend. Did you know that pressing “n” will open up a new tweet dialogue box (on native web Twitter)? Or that you can easily favourite a tweet by simply pressing “f”?

Free yourself from distractionsFinally, we all know how damn distracting the internet is. You want to get on with work, but … Gchats … and Twitter … You don’t want to tear the ethernet cable from the computer, because you still need the internet in some capacity.So how to get around this? Luckily, there is software you can use to help.Cold Turkey, for instance, can be downloaded and will prevent a user from visiting sites, but whitelist others. You can even lock certain sites and applications on a timer setting to truly ensure you keep away from Facebook. Cold Turkey is free, with a paid-for pro model, but there are other productivity applications, such asSelfControl.

Tracking the number of deaths caused by US drone strikes in countries like Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia? There are apps for that. Or rather, there were – until Apple removed them from its app store.Metadata+ was launched in early 2014by Josh Begley, a data artist and research editor for The Intercept. It used data from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to send push notifications to its users whenever someone was killed by a US drone.The app wasrejected five timesunder its original name of Drones+, before Apple approved it as Metadata+. A year and a half on, the app has been removed from the App Store, with Begley telling users the cause was “excessively crude or objectionable content” – referring to a specific clause in Apple’s developer rules.The app used text and maps rather than images of the deaths that it reported, so it could not be considered to be even moderately crude.A screenshot of Begley’s iTunes Connect accountpublished by Gawkermakes it clear that it’s the latter half of the clause that caused the removal. “Your app contains content that many users would find objectionable.”Begley told Gawker that while Metadata+ will continue to work for people who have already installed it, new users will not be able to download it.He runs a Twitter account calledDronestreamthat performs the same role, while his other iOS appEphemeral+also records drone strikes, but was removed by Apple after media coverage of the Metadata+ takedown.Apple had not responded to a request for comment by time of publication.The company has faced scrutiny before about its approach to censorship with apps – from games aboutsweatshops,child-labour,people-trafficking,North Koreaandthe civil war in Syriathrough to its decision in June toremove games from its store that featured the Confederate flag.Apple famously spelled out its beliefs that apps should be treated differently to other forms of media and entertainment, in its App Store rules:“We view Apps different than books or songs, which we do not curate. If you want to criticize a religion, write a book. If you want to describe sex, write a book or a song, or create a medical App.”Apple has shown a willingness to rescind controversial decisions – as in itsu-turn over nudity in the game Papers, Please– but Begley has not said whether he plans to appeal the decision to remove Metadata+ from the App Store.Update: Ephemeral+ has now also been removed by Apple:Hope you downloaded it. Ephemeral just got pulled toohttp://t.co/OWsYel6na4pic.twitter.com/QvOOZHItRe&mdash; Josh Begley (@joshbegley)September 30, 2015
Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, has been put on the spot over the launch of a consultation process being viewed as a crude attempt to curb the explosive growth in London ofUber, the taxi hailing app.Simon Walker, the director general of the Institute of Directors, said that Johnson, together with chancellor George Osborne and business secretary Sajid Javid, should be reducing regulation in the capital’s taxi and private car hire market rather than bringing in new and stiffer rules. Walker was responding to a set of proposals from Transport for London (TfL), revealed on Tuesday, which are said to reflect the mayor’s concerns about traffic congestion in London. Johnson is the chair of TfL.The IoD boss called the measures “heavy-handed” and said they would “damage London’s reputation for innovation”.Walker said: “TfL is right to take an interest in the way companies like Uber have disrupted the way we travel around the capital. But their proposals for further restrictions to an already heavily regulated industry are backwards and would damage London’s reputation as a city which celebrates innovation and embraces change.Related:Transport for London could crack down on Uber in taxi consultation“Boris Johnson, George Osborne and Sajid Javid have set themselves up as passionate advocates of the free market. How they proceed from here is a crucial test of those ideals,” Walker added.Walker’s outburst came as Uber fought back against a possible crackdown on its services with the publication of a petition that was signed by nearly 90,000 Londoners by mid-afternoon.The measures being considered by TfL could include the introduction of an interval of at least five minutes between a booking and the start of a journey.Other proposals involve a requirement for drivers to pass an English language test and a map reading assessment, while firms could have to operate a fixed landline telephone and accept bookings up to seven days in advance.The escalating row over the future of Uber’s service in London took place against the background of further controversies in Europe. Earlier this week, Dutch police raided Uber’s office in Amsterdam as part of a criminal investigation and on Wednesday two executives from the firm appeared in Paris for the start of a trial, facing a range of charges, including some under a law that bans the company’s low-cost Uberpop car-sharing service.In London, TfL chief operating officer for surface transport, Garrett Emmerson, said: “We are launching a public consultation in order to inform and improve the regulations that govern the capital’s private hire trade.”Uber is urging its customers to sign the petition, saying “these rules make no sense”. In a statement on its website, the US-backed company said: “TfL also wants to restrict carpooling, including new services like Uberpool.Related:Black cabs face extinction unless rules change, say London mayor contenders“This enables people going in the same direction to share a car, cutting the cost of the trip as well as congestion on London’s streets.“And the proposed rules threaten drivers’ livelihoods by forcing them to drive for just one operator.”TfL’s proposals are backed by Sadiq Khan, Labour’s candidate to succeed Boris Johnson as the next mayor of London, and by thousands of black cab and minicab drivers. Khan tweeted: “Welcome news of new proposals to regulate taxi and private hire vehicles. We must ensure we protect Londoners and our historic taxi trade.”Johnson and TfL have been viewed as soft onUberover the past three years, during the firm’s explosive growth phase in London. But Johnson has become increasingly concerned about the growth in the number of cabs in London and the congestion they cause.
Tesla Motors has unveiled its new electric sport utility vehicle (SUV), the Model X, withmuch fanfare in California.The debut comes amid growing speculation that low-carbon vehicles are finally on the verge of a breakthrough after the Volkswagen emissions scandal.The Model X has been billed by Tesla and its chief executive,Elon Musk,as the company’s most advanced vehicle to date.The specifications and the look of the Model X will certainly catch the eye of motorists who have become disillusioned by the traditional automotive industry in light ofVW cheating emissions tests on diesel cars.Musk claims the scandal shows the time has come for carmakers to “move to a new generation of technology” or face being wiped out.“What the Volkswagen [scandal] is really showing is that we’ve reached the limit of what’s possible with diesel and gasoline,” he said.However, the launch of the Model X was two years later than scheduled and it will cost consumers up to $144,000 (£95,000).Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk introduces the Model X.Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters“I’m not sure anyone should make this car,” Musk said at the launch. “There’s far more there than is really necessary to sell the car.”The car is the latest step in Musk’s plan to transform the automotive industry, and he has his eyes on developing fully autonomous cars within the next three years.But Tesla, which was founded in 2003, is yet to make a profit and delivered just 31,655 cars in its last financial year. In the UK, just 15,869 ultra low-emission vehicles were registered in 2014, although this was a 264% increase on the previous year.David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston Business School in the Midlands, said electric cars remain a luxury product at present due to their cost.However, he said the emissions crisis could be a“profoundly important moment”in the automotive industry and encourage electric carmakers to step up their investment in research and development.Diesel cars face tighter regulations and greater taxation, Bailey added, and the mayors of leading cities could restrict their movement in favour of low-carbon vehicles.The Model X launch was two years later than scheduled.Photograph: Getty Images“The cost of electric cars has held back the development of a mass market,” Bailey said. “A gamechanger could be the Gigafactory [which will be the biggest battery factory in the world] that Tesla is building.”Apart from its price, the Tesla’s Model X represents a step-up in electric car technology. The electric4x4 can reach 60mph in 3.2 seconds, has a top speed of 155mph and its battery charge lasts for 25o miles.The car is equipped with seven seats, a 43cm touchscreen for controlling driving and entertainment systems, and double-hinged falcon wing doors that can open with just 30cm of space either side of the car.The Model X also includes an array of sensors, including a radar and sonar system that applies the brakes if there is danger of an accident, and doors that open automatically when the driver approaches.With Tesla and a string of other ambitious companies developing electric cars, analysts at Fitch, the credit-rating agency, believe theVW crisis could spark a turning point in the industry.Emmanuel Bulle, senior director of corporates at Fitch, said: “Regulators will reassess the timeline to reach planned more stringent emission limit targets and could review the targets themselves.“The scandal could accelerate the underlying growth of vehicles with alternative powertrains, including fuel cells, electric and hybrid engines.”Other electric car contendersAnalysts anticipate a boom in electric cars amid the fallout from the Volkswagen emissions scandal.Photograph: Clive Gee/PAGoogleThe internet multinational has developed a driverless car with a top speed of 25mph, two seats, and a screen displaying its route. “The intention is that the passenger gets in the vehicle, says into microphone ‘Take me to Safeway’ and the car does the entire journey,” said Sarah Hunter, head of policy at GoogleX, the company’s advanced technology arm.In order to work, the car requires detailed maps with road features such as lanes, roundabouts and traffic lights accurate to within 1cm. Google is manufacturing a “few hundred” of the cars and Californian authorities are working on regulations to pave the way for the operation of driverless vehicles on its roads.ApplePerhaps the rival that the automotive industry fears the most, rumours about Apple building a car have been fuelled by the maker of the iPhone and iPad poaching staff from carmakers.The Apple car is codenamed as Project Titan and the company wants to launch it in 2019, according to recent reports in the US. Apple has held talks with US officials about testing the vehicle, although it is not clear whether the car will be fully autonomous.The firm has been keen on developing a car for a long time. Mickey Drexler, the boss of fashion chain JCrew and a former Apple board member, has said: “Steve Jobs, if he had lived, was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.”WheegoA US company that was spun out of Ruff &amp; Tuff Electric Vehicles, a manufacturer of recreational electric vehicles such as golf carts. Wheego imported car frames from China and fitted them with electric drivetrains and batteries in the US. Its first car, the Wheego Whip, was launched in 2009 and only capable of speeds of up to 35mph and a range of 50 miles.However, the Wheego LiFe, its second vehicle, can reach 65mph and was the third electric car approved for use on US highways after the Tesla Roadster and the Nissan Leaf.BYDBYD is China’s answer to Tesla and has found a powerful ally in Warren Buffett, the veteran investor, who controls a 10% stake in the company. Trading in the company’s shares has been volatile, but its e6 electric car is already used for chauffeur services in London and taxis in the city of Shenzhen in China.It has designed and built London’s first zero-emission double-decker bus, which launches in October, and has become a major manufacturer of rechargeable batteries.
My favourite new feature of iOS 9 is Wi-Fi Assist, a smart new setting – on by default on the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system – which allows the phone to gracefully fall back to cellular data when the Wi-Fi in the area flakes out. Admittedly, the fact that it’s my favourite says as much about the nuts-and-bolts nature of iOS 9 (and my own lack of desire to bother with Siri and Spotlight), but there it is.In my own daily use of the operating system, on both an iPhone 6 and 6S, it’s closed a number of black spots in my daily routine. As I’m leaving work, for instance, my phone stays connected to the Guardian’s wifi network until I’m about 100m down the road, but that connection’s too weak for real use almost immediately.Previously, that meant that streaming media cut out for the couple of minutes it took me to get down the stairs, out the building and down the road, but now my 4G picks up almost immediately. A similar hole has been patched as I leave my house in the morning.All of which is to say that, if you have an iPhone, you shouldn’t necessarily follow press reports that tell you to “change this setting to avoid massive iPhone data bills”.The reports largely cite one negative experience with Wi-Fi Assist,that of the Gizmodo journalist Chris Mills. Mills, who has been using iOS 9 since the beta version was released a few months ago, writes:“Since downloading the iOS 9 beta that introduced Wi-Fi Assist, I’ve used around one-third more data a month (4GB vs my regular-as-clockwork 3GB).“It’s impossible to say if that extra usage is directly related to Wi-Fi Assist, but I have my suspicions. On the iPhone 6s that I’ve only been using for three days, my data usage is at 950MB; half of that is from Netflix, which I make certain to never use when I’m on the go. In fact, the only time I’ve used it in the past couple days was at home, using what I thought was wifi.”Others, including a Guardian colleague, have had a similar experience, with their phones consuming more data since updating to iOS 9.To a certain degree, this is expected: the whole point of Wi-Fi Assist is that the iPhone will start to use mobile data where it wouldn’t have done before. But if you’re sitting in your home watching Netflix, something’s probably gone wrong if your phone falls back to cellular data (although, given some of the homes I have lived in, I’d have killed for something to patch the holes in terrible wifi).At the same time, pre-emptively turning off Wi-Fi Assist will lose you access to one of the best new features of iOS 9 – and one which is fast becoming standard on other devices. Samsung, for instance, offers users “smart network switch”, a similar feature which allows seamless playback of streaming media.If you are on a limited data plan, those features could be the straw that broke the camel’s back. Over-use charges are never pleasant, and if you’re happy with your phone as it is and can’t afford to get more bandwidth from your provider, it may be worth turning it off – after spending a while with it on, and monitoring your mobile usage in the iPhone’s settings.More usefully, setting data-heavy apps such as Netflix to “wifi only” (in this case, found in the iPhone’s settings app) will let you keep your usage low while still benefiting from the feature in daily life.But if you’ve got slack in your allowances, or are on an unlimited data package from a provider such as Three (and you should be on an unlimited data package, it’s 2015), leave Wi-Fi Assist on.Predictably, the setting has been picked up as the whipping boy of the new operating system. Give it a few more days, and we’ll be hearing about “wifiassistgate”, and people will be demanding an apology from Apple. But, as ever, there’s a certain amount of feedback in the hype cycle, leading to people who otherwise wouldn’t have had an issue blaming Wi-Fi Assist for all their problems.One user posted on the Apple support forumsasking how to turn off Wi-Fi Assiston their iPhone 4S, blaming it for making their phone be “super slow, glitchy, and losing battery fast”. A few posts later, they got their answer: Wi-Fi Assist isn’t actually on the iPhone 4S.So before you blame the latest bugbear for your issues, give it a go. It’s not as bad as all that.
“Algorithms can’t do it alone. They’re very handy, and you can’t do something of this scale without ‘em, but you need a strong human element.”That’s Apple’s Jimmy Iovine,talking to the Guardian in Juneahead of the launch ofApple Music, the company’s new music-streaming service. The same interview saw him label rivals like Spotify as mere “utilities” lacking Apple’s human touch.Three months on, Apple Music’s earliest adopters are nearing the end of its three-month free trial, and must decide whether its blend of algorithms and people is worth paying for.Their decision will be based on a service that does some things well, but – asApple itself has admitted– needs improvement in other areas.Basic detailsApple Music is available for PC and Mac as part of the iTunes software, and for iOS devices within their preloaded Music app. An Android version will follow later this year.Like rival services, the core of Apple Music is a catalogue of recordings – 30m songs – to stream “on demand”, with recommendations, themed playlists and radio-like stations to help people navigate it. Here, there’s also a live radio station, Beats 1, and a social section called Connect.For the most part, the catalogue is the same as those of its rivals. Apple does have Taylor Swift’s latest album 1989 as a streaming exclusive, while new releases from Dr Dre and Drake/Future have debuted on Apple Music a week or two before appearing on other streaming services.A membership – Apple is avoiding the word “subscription” – costs £9.99 a month for one person, or £14.99 for a family plan covering up to six people. Some elements, including Beats 1, are available for free to non-members who sign in with an Apple ID.Apple Music’s New section.Exploring the musicYou can search for albums and songs on Apple Music to play, as well as adding them to your own playlists and downloading them for offline access. Like its rivals, it also recommends you old and new music that it thinks you’ll like.These recommendations are found in two sections of the app: New and For You. New is where you’ll find new tracks and albums, popular playlists, music videos and other promotional suggestions – for example, in September, links to artists playing that month’s Apple Music Festival.Related:Apple Music interview: 'Algorithms can't do it alone – you need a human touch'New is also the way in to the playlists being compiled by Apple’s in-house team and guest curators. It’s one of Apple Music’s strongest features: a deep selection of playlists that mines plenty of interesting niches.In one day exploring, I flitted between Resident Advisor’s guide to Ninja Tune; Pitchfork’s Early ‘80s Disco playlist; a Northern Soul collection; a selection of hip-hop tracks sampling Booker T &amp; the MGs; and playlists exploring the influences on Chvrches, Nirvana and My Bloody Valentine.Apple Music also has a group of “The A-List” playlists covering pop, dance, alternative, hip-hop, rock, R&amp;B, electronic and new artists, which offer a good selection of what’s bubbling up on the service.The obvious comparison is to Spotify, which also has a large selection of playlists compiled in-house. Apple’s tend to be shorter with 12-20 tracks at a time, while Spotify’s tend to be longer at 80 tracks or more: better suited for playing on shuffle. Both approaches can work well, though.Bar the odd tone-deaf moment – a penny for St. Vincent or Sleater-Kinney’s thoughts on topping a “Girls with Guitars” playlist – Apple’s playlist curation is a strong point, although its rivals are far from the characterless utilities that Apple paints them as on this front.Algorithms at workThe For You feature is where Apple’s algorithms come in to play, providing a feed of suggestions for playlists and albums based on your iTunes music collection and Apple Music listening habits. The more you use it, the better the recommendations should become – in theory.Three months in, it’s too early to provide a definitive verdict on this, especially as in my case Apple Music was challenged from the start: I’ve been a paying Spotify user since 2008, so Apple knows very little about my music life over the past seven years, apart from that I bought the last Beyoncé and Taylor Swift albums (which weren’t on Spotify).Related:Spotify has six years of my music data, but does it understand my tastes?Unsurprisingly, my early days of For You were driven by this: lots of Britpop, mid-90s dance and singer-songwriter recommendations based on my pre-2008 iTunes collection, and the odd “Workout like Beyoncé” playlist – which sounds inappropriate, but as a bangers-not-ballads collection of Bey and Destiny’s Child tracks is actually marvellous.Spotify, by contrast, knows what I’ve been listening to in the last seven years: its “Discover” section is currently recommending me albums similar to Disclosure, Best Coast, Courtney Barnett, Django Django and Jamie Woon among others. Meanwhile, its excellent Discover Weekly playlist throws a new batch of new artists and songs at me every week.Somewhere between these two poles lies a full picture of the musical me. As things stand, Spotify is better at recommending me new artists, while Apple Music is better for bathing in the warm, neon-gloved glow of Best of ‘90s Indie-Dance, Vol. 2.Even so, Apple Music’s algorithms are learning fast: later in the three-month trial, one day’s recommendations included introductions to Hot Chip, Laura Marling and Orbital as well as albums by Primal Scream, Saint Etienne, Django Django, Jungle, Sharon Van Etten and the Chemical Brothers. An encouraging start.Apple Music’s For You feature.Radio rocks?Radio is a big part of Apple Music, including live Beats 1 and the themed collection of “stations” – rock, pop, hip-hop etc – which aren’t quite as specific as playlists, but may work if you just want something on in the background.Beats 1 is a big deal for Apple Music, broadcasting live to the world for 12 hours a day, then repeating that run of shows for the following 12 hours, with a mixture of professional DJs and guest artists with their own shows.Related:What happens when you listen to Beats 1 radio for 24 hours? Lots and lots of DrakeBeats 1 will feel familiar to anyone who’s listened to the BBC’s specialist radio shows and stations in the UK: no wonder given that Apple poached several of the Beeb’s producers as well as Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe.The focus is squarely on new music, which won’t appeal to everyone, although with iOS devices now owned by a broad section of the population, there’s clearly scope for a Beats 2 for older and/or more mainstream music fans in the future.Beats 1 is good, with artist-run shows from the likes of St Vincent, Josh Homme, Q-Tip and Elton John reminding me (in a good way) of why the likes of Iggy Pop, Cerys Matthews, Jarvis Cocker, Guy Garvey and Huey Morgan have helped the BBC’s 6Music build such a strong character.Lowe’s enthusiasm for new music remains infectious, and colleagueJulie Adenugais a real breath of fresh airwaves too. Beats 1’s weakness at launch was its lack of archived shows for time-shifted listening, but that’s since been sorted: shows can be searched for within Apple Music, and are posted on DJs’ Connect profiles.Failing to ConnectIf Beats 1 is a strength for Apple Music, the Connect section is a big disappointment. It was pitched as part Twitter, part Instagram and part SoundCloud: a place for artists, DJs and tastemakers to post status updates, photos, videos and even full songs.As a fan, you follow your favourites to get a feed of their posts, which you can comment on. Apple saw it as a special club for exclusive tracks, raw lyrics and behind-the-scenes insights beyond those available on other social networks. For now, few artists are delivering on that promise.Related:Apple admits it has 'homework to do' to improve Apple MusicIn fact, many notable musicians are posting barely once a week, with many of those updates either reposted photos from Instagram and Twitter; exhortations to buy tickets, stream or buy albums; or tune in to Beats 1 shows.Connect isn’t offering anything you can’t get from Twitter and Facebook, and while Apple is promoting songs and videos “discovered on Connect” within Apple Music, it’s nowhere near as vibrant a pool of new and unsigned music as, say, SoundCloud.Apple Music also reinforces the familiar criticism that Apple doesn’tgetsocial. There’s no sense of what your friends are listening to, unlike Spotify with its live ticker of their plays, and its chart of your friends’ top tracks.Apple Music’s system for creating and sharing your own playlists with friends also lags behind: the sense is of a top-down approach, Apple’s editors and its media partners are the curators, and you’re the listener.This will suit plenty of people just fine, but if you cherish the moments where a friend says “I’ve never heard of [band X]” and five minutes of dragging-and-dropping later you’re pinging them a personalised playlist... it’s still possible on Apple Music, but it could be easier.Two snapshots from my Connect feed: promotion and reposted updates.Interface and iCloud issuesIf you’re switching from another streaming music service like Spotify or Rdio, being hurled back into daily usage of iTunes on the desktop or the iOS Music App can be a jarring experience.If you’re already using either or both of those, you’ll face less of a culture shock, and in fairness the more I used it, the less I found myself grimacing at the user interface.More troubling were the anguished howls in the early days of Apple Music from some users with large iTunes music libraries, who’d seenportions of their collections deleted without warning. Other complaints have focused on problems adding albums to local libraries, and keeping that synchronised between devices.My iTunes library appears to be intact, although it’s hard to say for sure since it’s been gathering digital dust since 2008.One of Apple Music’s key strengths should be the way it brings your MP3 collection together with the wider streaming catalogue, so it’s baffling that such a major – for those affected – bug was allowed to slip through the pre-launch checks.Apple has since patched the error, but if you’ve yet to try Apple Music and are concerned, back your library up before signing up. A sensible move regardless of any specific bug.So, is Apple Music worth paying for?As with Spotify, Deezer, Google Play All Access and other streaming services, £9.99 a month for unlimited access to 30m tracks is good value for any music lover.Apple Music’s family plan is particularly good value, whether you’re a parent wanting to keep your kids off torrent sites, or living with housemates. While some rivals have family plans already, they tend to be more expensive: £9.99 for the first person then £4.99 for each additional family member. Google Play has become the first to match Apple’s family-plan price, though, and other rivals will surely follow.Related:How much do musicians really make from Spotify, iTunes and YouTube?Is Apple Music worth £9.99 a month more than its rivals are? My main reason not to move over from Spotify is less about features, and more about data – the data Spotify holds on my music habits, and how it uses that data for recommendations, whether in the Discover Weekly playlist or the “Now” feature that recommends music based on your habits at the current time of day.That, plus the prospect of rebuilding my own playlists (not to mention giving up Discover Weekly and the dozen-or-so trusted playlists that I follow from other people) is what will keep me with that service for the time being.The people most willing to pay for a music-streaming subscription may be the toughest for Apple to sign up, then. But we’re in the minority: 20 million Spotify subscribers plus six million on Deezer, three million on Rhapsody/Napster and an unknown number paying for Rdio, Tidal and other rivals. There are hundreds of millions more people streaming music for free on services like YouTube, SoundCloud and Spotify’s free tier.So if you’re looking for a paid streaming service, Apple Musicisworth paying for. But if you’re happy getting your music for free, you’ll probably want to save yourself £9.99 a month. Apple’s challenge is to change your mind, and while it’s made an encouraging start, there is more work to do.Oh, and one more thing … if you’re a trial member it’s worth noting, the New York Post claims thataround half of the 15 million trial members of Apple Music haven’t turned off its auto-pay option. So if you’re one of them, you might want to check you’re not making your choice by default.
Elon Musk’s all-electric-car company Tesla has launched its highly anticipated SUV, the Model X.The seven-seater car has falcon doors that open upwards instead of outwards, can drive 250 miles per charge and will hit 60mph from a standing start in 3.2 seconds with a top speed of 155mph.The Model X is Tesla’s most advanced car yet, with a range of sensors including cameras, radar and sonar systems enabling partial self-driving and automatic braking safety features that can even work at high speeds.Tesla claims its double-hinged falcon wing doors can open with only 30cm of space either side of the car and have sensors to detect objects and people and avoid hitting them when opening or closing.Elon Musk demonstrating the new Model X falcon doors.Photograph: Stephen Lam/ReutersIt also features a large 17in touchscreen for controlling in-car and driving systems, all-wheel drive and an air filtration system that Musk says can protect customers from a biological attack with a “bioweapon defence mode”.The Model X is the third Tesla car to be launched since the company’s inception in 2003. The first was theTesla Roadster, an electric sports car based on a Lotus Elise launched in 2007.Thepopular Model S saloon car, on which the Model X is based, was launched in 2012 and had sold 75,000 vehicles by June this year.The Model X was originally unveiled in 2012, but engineering delays forced the car’s initial 2014 launch plan back to this year.Cars ordered now will still take 8 to 12 months to deliver to customers in the US. A European launch is anticipated at a later date.Elon Musk claims that the Model X’s air filtration system is capable of keeping occupants safe from biological weapons with a new “bioweapon defence mode”.Photograph: Stephen Lam/ReutersThe Model X is an important step in the evolution of the electric car. The SUV and crossover market is expanding, with models such as the Nissan Qashqai placed fifth in the UK with around 40,000 new registrations in 2015 already, according to data from Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.The Model X costs $130,000 in the US – the Model S starts at just under £50,000 in the UK – but Musk says that Tesla hopes to launch its Model 3 “electric car for the people” costing $35,000 in 2017.Tesla Model S car review
Facebook is not planning to make its users pay £5.99 [or $5.99 for US users] to keep their status updates private. Is this news? It may be to the people who’ve been sharing a hoax claiming the opposite.“Now it’s official! It has been published in the media. Facebook has just released the entry price: £5.99 to keep the subscription of your status to be set to ‘private’. If you paste this message on your page, it will be offered free,” claims the widely-circulated chain message.“If not tomorrow, all your posts can become public. Even the messages that have been deleted or the photos not allowed. After all, it does not cost anything for a simple copy and paste.”It also does not cost anything for a simple search on Google or myth-busting websiteSnopesto prove that this is a hoax, thankfully.In fact,according to the latter site, this particular hoax has been circulating since 2009 in various forms. At least this time round, it is not accompanied by a link that attempts to install malware on your computer.Facebook’s privacy settings remain unaltered, with posts and accounts able to be kept private by using the drop-down menu while publishing them, or the general-settings menu.The social network remains a target for hoaxes of this kind, with its sharing options – copy and pasting included – capable of helping them to spread rapidly.Facebook is trying to combat this. In January 2015 the company announced that it wastweaking its news-feed algorithm to crack down on false and misleading stories.“Today’s update to News Feed reduces the distribution of posts that people have reported as hoaxes and adds an annotation to posts that have received many of these types of reports to warn others on Facebook,” explained software engineer Erich Owens and research scientist Udi Weinsberg at the time.The fact that the £5.99 privacy hoax is being copied and pasted rather than spreading through the “share” button may be helping it to avoid those measures.
Video and music tend to hog the headlines around the subject of casting technology, but with its new Chromecast, Google is making a play in another area: games.Gaming, once dominated by specialist companies, is increasingly becoming a battleground for the tech giants.Google’s rival Apple recently focused on games as a key selling point of its updated Apple TV. That device can download and run games, spurring talk of it competing with established games consoles such as Sony’s PlayStation 4, Microsoft’s Xbox One and Nintendo’s Wii U.Now Google’s making playing games on smartphones but viewing them on TV’s a feature of its Chromecast, using your phone both as a controller and for its processing power.Google’s vice president of Chromecast, Mario Queiroz, argues this gives it a key advantage over the likes of Apple TV.“There’s a fundamental difference between the other models out there and what we’re doing. Games require computing power, and the smartphone has superior computing power to any of the popular streaming boxes that are out there. It may be one or two generations more computing power,” he told the Guardian.Related:Five of the best media-streaming boxes to turn your dumb TV into a smart one“By running the game on the smartphone, you’re taking advantage of much more powerful computing power than you are by downloading a game on to a streaming box and running it on that device,” he said.“Our model gives us a huge advantage in being able to run games and render much higher quality graphics. And we are seeing a lot of takeup by game developers of our APIs, including those that allow them to build multiplayer games. Something we think will be very popular with the Cast model.”Google launched the first Chromecast in July 2013 as a thumb-sized device that plugged into a television. By May 2015,the company had sold 17m of them, and accumulated a library of thousands of Android and iOS apps supporting its “cast” technology.It is hoping to build on this with the second-generation Chromecast, as well as with the Chromecast Audio, which will connect to speakers and hi-fis to enable them to play music from partner services, from the company’s own Google Play Music to partners like Pandora and, a new addition, Spotify.It’s far from the first gadget to do this, from the connected hi-fis of Sonos and other manufacturers to cheaper devices like the Gramofon, which also has a close relationship with Spotify, and which looks like the most direct rival for Chromecast Audio.Queiroz hopes that the latter device’s price at $35 will help connected audio in the home break out of being a technology for music and/or tech geeks, without requiring people to replace their hi-fis. “Fewer than 5% of US households have speakers that can connect to Wi-Fi,” he said.Can Google reach a decent number of the remaining 95%, and take this technology mainstream? “I think we will. That’s our objective. The pieces of this that are new – that can bring it mainstream – are firstly the apps that people already use to listen to music on their smartphones,” he said.“Second, they already have speakers and wifi in their homes. And now for $35, you are bringing all of that together.”Chromecast Audio expands Google’s Cast technology to speakers.Gustav Soderstrom, vice president of product at Spotify, suggested that devices like the Chromecast family can also bring bigger tech-industry concepts to a more mainstream audience.“If you think about last year’s big focus on the internet of things, people kept talking about connected fire alarms and similar devices. But the obvious thing is to get your music playing with those connected features. That’s the most natural entry point to the internet of things,” he said.“This $35 device may be the thing that takes it from ‘I’m a fan of the internet of things’ – which unfortunately not a lot of people are – to ‘I want music in my home’ which is a real use case. Most people don’t care if their thermostat talks to their fire extinguisher, even if I care about that quite a bit, because I’m a geek!”Soderstrom added that Spotify is excited about the amount of experimentation going on around music in the home, and not just for hardware.“There is a lot of experimentation about what the perfect interface is: is it a piece of glass, is it your voice, is it dedicated hardware? Amazon is experimenting with voice-only with its Echo, for example,” he said. “You see different companies taking different approaches.”The software and services running on these products are interesting because, in many cases, they will be interfacing with multiple people rather than a single owner. Google’s Queiroz said his company is looking to app developers to think about collaborative use cases.Related:Spotify has six years of my music data, but does it understand my tastes?“For multiplayer games, your smartphone is your controller,” he said, before citing an API launched by Google this year that will enable developers to add “joint queues” for their cast-enabled apps.“It’s something we’ve had from the very first day we launched YouTube for Chromecast: you can create playlists that everybody can contribute to: they go into the YouTube app and add to a joint queue across multiple people,” he said.Spotify, too, is thinking about the communal experience, and how to best fit it into the company’s mobile app, which is becoming ever more personalised to the individual owner of the smartphone it’s installed on.It will provide a design challenge for Spotify, but Soderstrom said the company is keen for its mobile app to rise to the task of understanding when a user is playing music at home – whether through a PlayStation 4, a Sonos hi-fi or a speaker with a Chromecast Audio attached – and adapting accordingly.“When you come home, with Connect, your speakers pop up and become available, so it understands your context in that sense, and that applies whether you’re on the train, in the home, in the car,” said Soderstrom. “It should be able to adapt to the situation you’re in.”•Sonos keen to support Apple Music alongside Spotify
Uber has welcomed the introduction of regulations for ride-sharing services in the Australian Capital Territory, saying the new rules simply underpin its existing annual driver background checks and vehicle inspections.Related:NRMA urges governments to regulate Uber and other ride-sharing services“Our checks are actually of a higher standard than the taxi industry and they are backed up by a rating system that drivers must maintain if they are to be kept on the system,” said David Rohrsheim, general manager of Uber Australia.“We won’t put cabs out of business. A cab is still the best way to get from A to B if you’re on George Street in Sydney. We just make better use of the cars that are out there ... There is a top-down mood for change in Australia.”Canberra will become the first place in Australia to allow the legal, regulated use of Uberand other ride-sharing services from October.The ACT government said it would allow services such as Uber to enter Canberra from 30 October to offer “safe, flexible and affordable” journeys to people.Ride-sharing vehicles will undergo accreditation and registration, including criminal and driving history checks, similar to taxi drivers.The ACT minister for transport reform, Shane Rattenbury, said the move would put pressure on Canberra taxi drivers, many of whom staged a three-hour strike earlier this month to protest against Uber’s imminent arrival.The ACT government will slash taxi licence fees from $20,000 to $10,000 from 30 October, with a further $5000 cut next year.A new transport booking service will replace the existing taxi network, allowing accredited drivers to carry passengers via Uber if they meet certain standards, such as being alcohol and drug free.“Public transport is an integral part of any city,” Rattenbury said. “These reforms are a win for Canberrans and those travelling to the territory, improving access to diverse transport options and competitive pricing.”Uber is an app-based service that allows customers to connect with nearby drivers via GPS and pay them, via the app, for their trip. The budget UberX and more expensive UberBlack versions are available in Australia, with about 1 million people signed up to the service.Senator David Leyonhjelm said he hoped MPs would now be able to use Uber more easily. Politicians are given Cabcharge dockets that can be used only in traditional taxis.“I use Uber from time to time, though not much because I usually conduct my business on my motorbike,” Leyonhjelm told Guardian Australia.“I’m an enthusiastic supporter of Uber. It’s a great example of using modern technology: it lowers costs and it gives consumers options. Using it for parliamentary work is hard because claiming it back is tedious and it’s easier to use a Cabcharge for a taxi.”Uber, which launched in the US in 2009, is available in 60 countries and has established regulated arrangements in about 50 jurisdictions around the world.But it is banned in some countries, such as Spain, and cities, including Berlin and Rio de Janeiro.Related:Uber taxi service banned in Berlin on safety groundsThe Canberra Taxi Industry Association did not respond to a request for comment. However, on its website the association described Uber’s claim that its drivers are vetted through rigorous safety checks as being “proven globally to be fatally flawed with many criminals becoming approved Uber drivers”.It also stated that the recent strike was arranged by drivers “concerned about the arrival of a multinational company threatening their financial viability and livelihood”.Rohrsheim said the only reason some people thought the service was unsafe was “a massive fear campaign – billboards that say Uber is no safer than hitchhiking. Choice [the consumer advocacy group]put out a reportwhich completely debunked that,” he said.Other Australian states and territories have undertaken reviews of ride-sharing services. Victoria, which has completed its review, is expected to be the next jurisdiction to decide whether to allow the regulated use of Uber.

Tim Cook has told a conference of business executives that American corporations have a responsibility to help improve equality, the environment and public education because of a lack of government progress in the past few decades.Speaking at the BoxWorks conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Cook insisted his position was not partisan but that equality should not still be an issue in 2015.“To give people a basic level of dignity and human rights over 200 years after we said all men are created equal … this is something we’re going to continue to evangelise about because it’s shocking to me that in 2015 we are even having to discuss this subject. There’s no cost to equality. It’s free,” said Cook.“Business has an important responsibility to society and that has grown markedly in the last couple of decades as government has found it more difficult to move forward and get as much done. That is not making a partisan statement … but I’m a product of public education and too many kids in public schools that aren’t good enough. They’re in essence born with a built-in headwind and things aren’t equal.”Research published in June by the bipartisan advocacy group First Focus found that the US government has consistently decreased spending on education, falling from 1.27% of overall spending in 2011 to just over 1% in 2015. Despite limited increases in some areas, the organisation found that overall education spending had been reduced by 19.8% over those four years.Cook went on to say that climate change needs to be taken seriously. He said Apple’s data centres run on 100% renewable energy and that almost 90% of its supply chain now uses renewable energy too. “In some areas I don’t want anyone to copy us but in this one, I want everybody to copy us.”Cook was talking to Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box, which provides cloud storage for businesses. Cook heavily pushed Apple’s strategy of expanding their products to businesses, saying Apple, which currently has a market capitalisation of $631bn, needed partnerships with IBM, Cisco and Box to diversify into specialist business markets, such as financial services.He said there hadn’t been enough innovation in mobile services for business, with most limited to email and browsing, and took the opportunity to take a swipe at Google, Apple’s most ferocious competitor. “We don’t believe in having one operating system for desktop and mobile – we think it subtracts from both and you don’t get the best experience,” he said referencing Android, Google’s ubiquitous operating system.When talking about partnering with Microsoft, a traditional rival, to introduce its Office software into iOS devices, Cook changed tack. Microsoft made a surprise appearance at an Apple event earlier this month, demonstrating their Office apps for iOS devices. “I’m not a believer in holding grudges – life is short, and you’re going to die soon. You want to have as many friends as you can have and if you can serve someone else better by partnering then you should do it.”Levie, wearing bright blue socks with white clouds combined with blue and orange sneakers, asked where Apple could go from here. “Maybe an airplane? Are you building a plane?”Cook – in black socks and black brogues – said: “No. There’s no iPlane. Maybe one needs to exist. But that’s not something we’re even thinking about.”Speaking to a crowd of sympathetic tech industry executives, Cook simultaneously played down Apple’s success while demonstrating the company’s dominance, asking the audience how many of them used an iPhone (several hundred) and how many used a Blackberry (two).“Our goal was never to be the biggest – we’ve never worried about selling the most. We just always wanted to be the best. We have always believed deeply that if we made the best, some people would want to buy it, and they would use it, and we would have a reasonable business. That strategy has worked for Apple since Steve [Jobs, former CEO] came back in ’97, and we’re still doing that.”
Edward Snowden may soon havemore space to write: Twitter is considering allowing its posts to stretch beyond 140 characters, according to a report citing unnamed sourceson tech news website Re/code.Twitter has struggled with flattening growth and is still in the midst of a search for a new CEO, with co-founder Jack Dorsey running the company in the interim.Related:Facebook working on 'dislike button', Zuckerberg saysDorsey has been voluble about his perception of a need for change at Twitter and on the company’s most recent earnings call was frank about his disappointment with the status quo.Other reports have speculated that Twitter will allow features making it easier to “tweetstorm,” or send multiple numbered tweets as a timeline-filling mini-essay in the manner of popular Twitter users like tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen and New Republic editor Jeet Heer.A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment.Heersaid on Twitterthat he didn’t like the idea of longer tweets.Since people are asking, I will state for the record I oppose twitter&#39;s move to go beyond 140 characters. The limit is a good thing.&mdash; Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet)September 29, 2015“Product initiatives we’ve mentioned in previous earnings calls, like instant timelines and logged-out experiences, have not yet had meaningful impact on growing our audience or participation,” Dorsey told investors on the company’s most recent earnings call. “This is unacceptable and we’re not happy about it.”Twitter most recently reported having 316m monthly active users – about one-fifth of Facebook’s user count – and it is looking for ways to increase that number, though it has had a great deal of success with advertising and monetization of its existing user base.Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research said the company was overperforming by any reasonable metric except its own. “Show me another business growing at 70% year over year,” he said. “The problem is one of expectations. They’re one of the top sellers of digital advertising on the planet.”The company’s stock hasrocked back and forthoverthe last year, largely due to fluctuating guidance from Twitter’s own executives.But it would be wrong to paint Twitter as the only social media company planning major changes to its user experience: Facebook is rumored to be trying out a “dislike” button (actually, the safest locution for it is probably “buttons other than ‘like’,” given that Mark Zuckerbergwasn’t clearon what exactly his product team was testing when he broke the news earlier in September), and Instagram will soon have video ads that are 30 seconds long.Dorsey is indeed the impetus for the change (which may not happen), an unnamed Twitter employee told Re/code: “Having Jack come in and say it’s OK makes all the difference in the world.”
Uber, the taxi-hailing app that is taking on traditional cab drivers around the world, faces the prospect of a severe crackdown in London under proposals from the capital’s transport authority.Transport for London is launching a consultation that includes measures such as forcing operators to provide booking confirmation details to the passenger at least five minutes before a journey starts. However, Uber picks up passengers three minutes after they request a car on average.“We are launching a public consultation in order to inform and improve the regulations that govern the capital’s private hire trade,” said Garrett Emmerson, chief operating officer for surface transport at TfL.TfL, which is overseen by London mayor Boris Johnson, has in the past been seen by rivals as being too soft on California-based Uber.Boris Johnson’s ‘luddite’ insult provokes taxi drivers – video“In recent years the private hire industry has grown exponentially and technology has also developed rapidly,” Emmerson said.“The consultation sets out a number of ways that standards across the industry could be raised, ensuring Londoners can continue to benefit from the service provided by licensed private hire vehicles. No final decisions have been made and we’re keen to hear a range of views from the trade and from Londoners, too.”Having taken a relaxed view on the growth of Uber at the outset, in recent months TfL has become increasingly worried by the growth in traffic on the roads of London and has decided to consult on new proposals for private hire companies. Some of these proposals would ban or restrict a proportion of Uber’s key features.Draft proposals include making operators offer a facility to pre-book up to seven days in advance. Uber currently offers a pre-booking service only minutes before a journey.Related:We live in an age of disruption. I’d rather be creative | Tom HodgkinsonAnother proposal would force drivers to work for one operator at a time. Many of Uber’s drivers are part-time workers. There is also a draft proposal that would place restrictions on ride sharing, which allows several customers to share a car and could threaten Uber’s plans to introduce its UberPool service in London.Uber immediately hit out at the plans. “These bureaucratic new rules will not improve your ride,” said Jo Bertram, Uber’s UK head.“They’re designed to address the concerns of black cab drivers, who feel under pressure from increased competition. But the answer is to reduce the onerous regulations cabbies face today – not increase them for everyone else.”Mike Galvin, head of regulatory affairs forAddison Lee, the largest private hire company in the UK, said TfL’s move came after a period in which legislation had been dropped to accommodate Uber. “They’re using the consultation to reinstate legislation that we worked under for years.”
A recent billboard campaign by the Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) encouraging users of dating apps Tinder and Grindr to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases has led to backlash from the two companies.Related:Popularity of 'hookup apps' blamed for surge in sexually transmitted infectionsTinder sent aletterto the foundation demanding it remove all references to the hookup app from their billboards and that it cease making “false and disparaging statements against Tinder”; according to the AHF, Grindr halted the foundation’s paid advertising for its free STD testing services on their site.“They’re tone deaf,” Michael Weinstein, president of AHF, told the Guardian. “It would have been much wiser for them to say that they’re concerned about their customers and look forward to working with us to help people get the checkups that they need. This would not have been the global story that it has become if they had not responded that way.”In an emailed statement, a Grindr spokesperson said that they have “always been concerned with the issues of men’s health” and with keeping “users informed and aware of health issues”.They added: “We were surprised at the approach the AHF took, and paused the campaign in order to speak with them and assess our relationship. In the end, we’re all on the same page regarding this issue, as health and wellness concerns us all.”The ads, which suggest that users of the apps are at risk for diseases like chlamydia and gonorrhea, show the silhouettes of two couples leaning in. Tinder and Grindr are plastered across two of their faces in large pink letters, while the remaining two silhouettes have the names of STDs on their profiles. To the right of the couples, a website for free STD testing is listed.“There are consequences to hooking up,” Weinstein told the Guardian. “That’s not a moralistic judgement. It’s just a fact and minimizing that is important.”Currently, there are 12 billboards up in Los Angeles and 45 bus bench ads. According to the AHF, they plan to expand the campaign to New York and south Florida.One of the billboards is only a few blocks from Tinder’s Beverly Boulevard headquarters, according to CBS affiliateKCAL9TV. Tinder sent a cease and desist letter to the healthcare foundation on 18 September.“These unprovoked and wholly unsubstantiated accusations are made to irreparably damage Tinder’s reputation in an attempt to encourage others to take an HIV test offered by your organization,” the letter read. “While Tinder strongly supports such testing, the Billboard’s statements are not founded upon any scientific evidence, and are incapable of withstanding critical analysis.”The foundationrespondedjust under a week later to deny Tinder’s request, saying it had “not made any false or disparaging statements against Tinder”. The organization cited an article in Vanity Fair titledTinder and the Dawn of the “Dating Apocalypsethat explores the role dating apps play in “encouraging casual sex among young adults” and a report released bythe Rhode Island Department of Healthin May thatcredited the rise in syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIVbetween 2013 and 2014 to high-risk behaviors like “using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters”.They added: “Rather than trying to chill AHF’s public health message by threatening AHF with frivolous lawsuits, AHF urges Tinder to support its message of sexual health awareness by encouraging Tinder users to get tested for STIs and to get treated promptly if they have an infection.”Tinder did not respond to requests for comment.
Google is making its own Android tablet called the Pixel C, its second wholly Google-made machine after theChromebook Pixel.The 10in Pixel C will have a high resolution screen, a metal body, and will resemble the Chromebook Pixel with a multi-coloured bar light on the back.The tablet will also have a keyboard accessory that docks with the tablet and holds it like a laptop.The Pixel C closed like a notebook.Photograph: GoogleThe Pixel C has a USB-C port for charging – the same one used on theChromebook Pixeland Google’s latest Nexus smartphones – but is not designed to replace Chromebooks, according to Google.Nexus tablets dead?The new tablet, briefly shown off at Google’s Nexus and Chromecast launch event in San Francisco, marks a departure from the partner-based model used by Google before with its Nexus tablets.The first Nexus tablet, the Nexus 7, was launched in 2012 and made by Asus. It followed the model established by the first Nexus smartphone made by HTC in 2010, where Google partnered with a manufacturer to produce a device with a pure Android experience without the manufacturer’s standard customisations.Google partnered with HTC last year to producethe Nexus 9 tablet, but the device suffered from manufacturing defects and overheating issues. It appears Google is replacing the Nexus tablet line with devices made wholly in-house.An Android laptop by any other name.Photograph: GoogleThe search company uses both its Nexus and Pixel device lines to show what its platforms can do, attempting to entice developers to create apps for those platforms.In this case the Pixel C is the new flagship Android Marshmallow tablet experience, which Google obviously thinks should be based at least partially around productivity in the new hybrid laptop-tablet category, started by Microsoft’s original Surface tablet in 2012.Apple recentlyannounced the iPad Prowith a larger screen and similar keyboard accessory available in November. The new devices will pit both Google and Apple in direct competition with Microsoft.The Pixel C will be available with either 32GB of storage for $499 (£330) or 64GB for $599 (£396) and is expected to be available before Christmas. The keyboard will cost $149 (£98).•Google Chromebook Pixel review: beautiful, powerful – but still just Chrome
Google has announced two new Chromecast streaming gadgets, one for streaming video and photos to a TV, and one for streaming music to any standard speakers.An updateto the original Chromecast, which has sold over 20m devices, the new video version receives streams over Wi-Fi using Google’s Cast protocol from compatible apps running on an Android or iPhone or a computer.The new Chromecast for the TV is a circular puck shape and plugs into the HDMI slot on a television via an integrated short, flat HDMI cable.The new Chromecast will be available in three colours and has a magnet that attaches the HDMI cable to the puck for storage.Photograph: GoogleThe new larger circular shape contains three Wi-Fi ariels supporting the newer dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac version, which should provide a “more robust, high quality streaming experience for less buffering than you would have found previously with the Chromecast” according to Google’s head of Chromecast for Northern Europe, Dan Saunders.The new device will also speed up streaming by pre-loading both apps and content it thinks you’ll want to access. Netflix will load its player and predict what you’re going to watch next and start buffering the video in the background before you select it so that it starts instantly without needing to wait for the first bit to download.The device will also feature more games including Rovio’s Angry Birds and some racing games, competing with Amazon’s Fire TV and Apple’s incoming new TV box.Chromecast AudioGoogle hopes the Chromecast Audio will do for the hi-fi what streaming media boxes and the Chromecast has done for TV.Photograph: GoogleGoogle’s first Chromecast Audio operates in a similar manner to the video version of Chromecast, but connects to a pair of speakers or a hi-fi via a 3.5mm line out, optical out or standard phono (RCA) jacks.“We’re trying to do for hi-fi what we’ve done with the TV – turn your hi-fi into a smart hi-ii,” said Saunders. “If you’re used to using apps on your smartphone then using the Chromecast should be easy, as all the processing and control is done on the phone.”The Chromecast Audio will support any audio streaming over Google Cast including Google’s Play Music, Deezer and TuneIn radio. Spotify also announced Chromecast support, while BBC Radio player support will be added in the near future.Google is also working on multi-room audio streaming using the Chromecast Audio, but it will not support the popular feature out of the box.Google’s Chromecast app for iOS and Android is also getting a makeover, suggesting new Chromecast apps and showcasing content from apps a user already has installed. Tapping on a show such as Breaking Bad within the new Chromecast app will take the user directly to the show within the Netflix app to start streaming it.The Chromecast app will also act as a remote control for the Chromecast streaming dongle allowing users other than the person who initiated the stream to pause playback without having to have the Netflix app or a subscription, for instance.Both new Chromecasts are powered by a microUSB cable and will be available in the next week or so, costing £30.Google Chromecast review: simple, fast internet TV
Google has launched two new flagship smartphones, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, to demonstrate what its new version of Android “Marshmallow” can do.The two new handsets are made by Google’s long-term partner LG and smartphone newcomer Huawei, and push the new features of Marshmallow, including fingerprint scanners, the new Nexus camera and Google’s improved personal assistant Now on Tap.Andrei Popescu, an engineering director within Google’s Android team, said: “The Nexus devices are our idea of embodiment of the perfect Android device – a platform for application developers to show off the new features of Marshmallow and show what Android can do.”Google Nexus 5X comes in three colours.Photograph: GoogleThe LG Nexus 5X features a 5.2in 1080p screen with a density of 423 pixels per inch (ppi), which is protected by last year’s Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3. The smartphone features the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor as the LG G4, 2GB of RAM and the choice of either 16 or 32GB of storage within a relatively compact frame.The 16GB Nexus 5X will cost £339 – £379 for 32GB of storage – and replaces the now two-year-old Nexus 5. It will be available on 16 October in the UK.The Google Nexus 6P comes in three colours, aluminium (pictured), white and black.Photograph: GoogleThe Huawei Nexus 6P is the Chinese manufacturer’s first Google Nexus device, having made Android smartphones for several years under both the Huawei and Honor brands.The Nexus 6P features a 5.7in 2K AMOLED screen with a pixel density of 518ppi, rivalling that of Samsung’s Note 5, which is protected by the latest Gorilla Glass 4, as featured on Samsung’s Galaxy S6 range of smartphones. The Huawei smartphone features the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 octo-core processor, 3GB of RAM and a choice of 32, 64 or 128GB of storage in an aluminium unibody shell available in silver, black and white.The Nexus 6P will be available from 26 October costing £449 for 32GB of storage, £499 for 64GB, and £579 for 128GB in the UK.Both new smartphones share common Google features beyond the software. Both smartphones feature quick charging and the new USB type-C connector, also used in Google’s Chromebook Pixel, the OnePlus 2 and Apple’s new MacBook. They also both feature Nexus Imprint fingerprint scanners on the back showing off Marshmallow’s now built-in support for fingerprint sensors.Popescu said: “With baked in fingerprint support in Marshmallow it will allow application developers to use the fingerprint sensor and not have to try and support each individual manufacturer’s implementation.”Google has also been able to make sure that something as important as a fingerprint is stored on the trusted zone – a secure area of the system that cannot simply be accessed by any app, as was the case for some implementations such as HTC’s One Max.Google’s new Sensor Hub motion co-processor and new Nexus Camera are also available on both smartphones, with an 12.3-megapixel image sensor that promises to capture more light and take photos faster with laser autofocus.The new Nexus smartphones will mark the start of the rollout of Google’s next version of Android, which promises to extend battery life, provide more intelligent assistance features and support more advanced hardware features such as motion and voice-recognition co-processors.Marshmallow will also continue Google’s “Material Design” aesthetic – a significant upgrade in design and uniformity across the operating system and applications that better rivals Apple’s iOS running on the company’s iPhones.Popescu said: “Marshmallow is our most polished version of Android to date. We’ve really worked hard on making things like the animations super smooth.”Marshmallow will come to some of Google’s previous Nexus devices, and to other Android devices made by other manufacturers in the next year.•Google Android 5 Lollipop review - faster, prettier and better battery life
The latest version of Apple’s laptop and desktop operating system OS X 10.11 El Capitan will genuinely speed up your computer, particularly if you’ve got an older Mac.As with Apple’s other recent Apple software updates, El Capitan is very much a blink-and-you-miss-it update. Visually it’s almost identical to the current OS X Yosemite and you will be hard-pressed to see what’s changed other than the new San Francisco typefacefrom iOS 9.That’s because El Capitan is the “tock” in Apple’s “tick, tock” two-year update cycle. Big changes happen on the surface every two years with the tick updates with the following year consolidating and refining.El Capitan’s brief was pure speed and it is really noticeable, particularly on one-or-two year-old Macs. It’s difficult to actually pinpoint where the speed comes from, it’s just generally a lot more snappy.Apps load and respond visibly faster, as do documents and emails. Switching between apps is also faster, as is browsing large PDFs, documents and images.Apple Maps gains public transport directions, mirroring iOS 9.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianApple claims that speed has improved between 1.4 and four times the performance of OS X Yosemite, depending on the task, and in my testing I would say that the figure is about right. Part of that performance boost is the introduction ofApple’s Metal graphics system, which was first introduced with iOS 8.Metal replaces OpenGL and speeds things up. Apps that use Apple’s core graphics system will benefit without having to do anything. Those that can and will interact with Metal directly – programs such as Adobe Photoshop or Premier, or games – will see an even greater boost.It’s the first version of any of Apple’s software I have installed that has actually sped up the machine.SpecificationsOS X 10.11 El Capitan is a free update from the Mac App Store released on 30 September.It supports machines with at least 2GB of RAM and 8GB of free storage space and in the following models:MacBook Pros from mid 2007 and onwardsMacBook Airs from late 2008 and onwardsMacBooks from late 2008 and onwardsMac mini from early 2009 and onwardsiMac from mid-2007 and onwardsMac Pro from early 2008 and onwardsShake and you shall seeTyping out natural language feels a little strange, but mostly does what it is meant to and makes finding files or emails a little easier.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianBeyond speed, a few small elements have been improved. Shake the cursor and it enlarges so you can see it more easily if it’s lost on screen. Spotlight search can now be moved and enlarged and responds to natural language searches such as “files I worked on in March” or “email I sent to Alex about adblocking” – which sounds great, but in practice just skips out a bit of syntax such as “subject: adblocking”.El Capitan improves full-screen window management with Split View,taken straight from iOS, allowing two apps to fill one screen with a resizing line down the middle just like Windows 8. Drag a window to the top of the screen or hold down the green “maximise” button to organise the windows and drag them on to a new space or on top of a pre-existing one to get going.It’s nothing you can’t already do manually or with third-party programssuch as Moom, but it hides menus and other unnecessary program features to fill the screen with more of the text or work you’re trying to get done.Windows 8 or 10, or iPad Air 2 users with iOS 9, will be familiar with Split View.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianIt’s still easy to lose things in multiple spaces, and users with desktops or more than one screen are likely to ignore Split View. Laptop users might find a use for it if they’re already using full screen apps.Most of Apple’s built-in apps for OS X have also been tweaked here and there. Full-screen Mac Mail is now easier to use with compose windows that minimise to the bottom of the screen and stack in tabbed windows. The same swiping gestures to archive or mark email as read from iOS also work on a touchpad too, although I found moving through mail with keyboard shortcuts easier.Safari’s now got pinned tabs, which shrink into the left-hand side and persist, which makes web apps such as Twitter a bit more permanent. A new mute button also exists in the address bar to kill annoying background audio from videos or ads.Apple Maps now shows public transport directions. Photos supports extensions as it does on iOS, allowing such apps as Pixelmator to put part of their toolset right in the image-editing window of Apple Photos. Notes now supports everything that iOS 9 Notes can do, but only allows you to view sketches, not make them.The new compose window standing and minimising makes Mac Mail much more usable in full screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the GuardianVerdictThe visual and feature changes I found were all improvements, but really the update is all about speed.El Capitan is a free upgrade and available on Wednesday. It made older machines feel like new again and didn’t break anything in my testing. I can’t see why you wouldn’t upgrade, although maybe wait and see whether any bugs pop up before updating your main machine.Pros:faster, free, Split View, better full-screen Mail, easy mute in SafariCons:some features such as advanced notes need to sync with iCloud, looks essentially the same as Yosemite, Split View not novelOther reviews•iOS 9 review: an upgrade to jump for, or skip?•Apple Watch OS2 review: more app potential but killer feature still missing•Windows 10 review – final version of Windows might be Microsoft’s best ever
Last week,63 million people were cut offfrom internet and mobile phone access in Gujarat, India. This didn’t stop Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi proclaiming over the weekend that communications access and, in particular,internet access, is the next important step in development. Modi didn’t seem bothered by the fact that, following mass demonstrations, a population the size of the UK lost all phone and internet communications forthe second time in less than a month. The world barely noticed.India is not alone. In Syria, the internet is used as a weapon of war – the disconnection of communications plays acentral role in the conflict. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, similarly, connectionswere cut following mass demonstrations against the government.And before anyone suggests that only less developed countries resort to drastic disconnection, similar measures have been discussed in case of an “emergency” in theUS,UKandGermany. The British government discussed quite extensively whether to shut down various communication channels during the2011 riots.Pakistan spearheads crackdownPakistan bears the dubious honour of leading the world in government-ordered communications shutdowns, with at least 24 large-scale disconnections since 2012­. Marked like few other nations by the global war on terror, even the highest ranks of government in Pakistan complain about the overwhelming power of the military. National security measures frequently go overboard, and the human rights of the populations affected are only insufficiently considered.Some 80% of people in Pakistan have mobile phone access. One in four holds a smartphone. When communications are disconnected, theeconomyisseriously affected, and mobility and social relations are severed. Neither ambulances nor fire departmentscan be contacted quickly. Despite the impressive resilience of the Pakistani people, the social consequences cannot be overlooked.A new research study between London, Islamabad and Berlinfound that, when communications are disconnected, the same regions already affected by other forms of exclusion are the worst hit. Large political rallies, but also regions seen as leaning towards the Taliban, are the most frequently affected by shutdowns in Pakistan. Since society constitutes through communication, for these communities, prevention of communication also constitutes exclusion from society.Disconnecting the disadvantagedThis logic extends to the waves of refugees moving across Europe. The issue here is that people don’t just need the internet to “phone home” – they need access to become part of European society. The internet is used to access education, entertainment and culture. It grounds social participation, and is the mechanism for accessing many key services. In the current crisis, the physical separation of refugees is augmented bydigital separation.“All the internet. All the people. All the time.”Nigerian web activist Nnenna Nwakanma’s call to action is simple to state, but hard to accomplish. Every crisis offers a new excuse for restrictions, and every “development problem” invites post-colonial reflex. TakeInternet.org, the initiative proudly championed by Facebook and partners. Facebook’s offer – recently partly rebrandedFree Basics, in an effort to take the sting out ofcontroversy about walled gardens, privacy and security– hasmore to do withaccess to Facebook than to the internet, and is a clever advertising campaign for Facebook’s rollout in emerging markets. But we’ve yet to see any serious attempt, notwithstanding Zuckerberg’s weekendcelebrity appeal with Bono, to resolving deep challenges of universal access.Given this landscape, we shouldn’t be surprised that we have left governments and corporations with the power to completely turn off the internet. Without the protection that accompanies the creation of public services – such as electricity or water ­– access to the internet and telecommunications are in discretionary hands. This gives both Modi and Zuckerberg the ability to flip the switch. Rather than providing all the internet to all the people all the time, we’re allowing a few powerful men to make the internet a commodity of their choosing.
At the EGX video games festival in Birmingham, Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios,took to the stage and essentially confirmedthat there will not be a follow-up to the PlayStation Vita handheld console. “The climate is not healthy for now because of the huge dominance of mobile gaming,” he lamented.But is this true?When the smartphone started its inexorable rise as a gaming platform, thanks mostly to the launch of the iPhone in 2007, business pundits were leaping over each other to declare the imminent death of the specialist games console. Why would people pay hundreds of pounds for a dedicated games machine if they were effectively carrying one around in their pockets all day? And then the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One arrived, shifting tens of millions of units, selling faster than their predecessors and generally doing okay.As for the handheld gaming sector, the area of gaming surely most at risk from mobile phones ... well, the Nintendo 3DS has now sold over 50m units, putting it within a whisker of the top ten best-selling games platforms of all time. It hasn’t done as well as the Nintendo DS, of course (150m sales), but then, the DS has been on sale for over a decade and the 3DS has only been out for four years – and it arrived in a very different, much more fragmented and diverse, market place. Unlike Vita, however, it ignored most of its competition – from internet-connected consoles, to smartphones and tablets – and did its own thing.Doing its own thing is something Nintendo has always understood, and why it has utterly dominated the handheld gaming sector. There were certainly other companies vying for a portion of the market when portable electronic games first started appearing in the late seventies, but it was Nintendo – or more specifically legendary industrial designer Gunpei Yokoi – that realised form factor, price, battery life and cuteness were going to be the defining features of a successful product.A girl playing a Gameboy during an anti-Iraq War demonstration in LondonPhotograph: Martin Argles/Martin ArglesThe Game &amp; Watch games were super simple, based on very cheap LCD screens, but they looked lovely, they were sturdy and they were cheap. When the GameBoy arrived in 1989, its monochrome display looked out of step with the wondrous visuals of the 16bit console era, but again, the tech was inexpensive and sturdy, and the games (Tetris, Super Mario Land, et al) exploited the limitations in an entirely loveable way. The combination of portability and kawaii design sensibilities meant that people actively enjoyed taking these things around with them and showing them to others.Nintendo knew almost instinctively that we would think of miniature games as endearing. There is just something about the reduced form factor that allows us to enjoy child-like experiences without feeling self-conscious. The industrial design legend Donald Norman talks about how humans project a series of expectations onto objects, and how designers need to understand these in order to make successful products. In short: we kind of want small things to be cute – and Nintendo gets that.But Nintendo’s rivals have usually made the error of thinking that to compete with Nintendo they had to beat it in terms of technology. The Neo Geo Pocket and Bandai Wonderswan totally understood the appeal of cuteness, but they were largely restricted to the Japanese market. In terms of global competitors – from the Sega Game Gear, through the Atari Lynx to the PlayStation Portable and Vita – the philosophy has been “bringing the home console experience to your pocket”. Not only has that proved costly to the consumer in terms of retail price and battery life, it grates against what a lot of people want from a portable experience.Sometimes, as a race, we allow ourselves to be loveable. It doesn’t happen much and we often have to express it in quite obtuse ways – through novelty socks, or action figure collections, or really liking Pixar movies. Portable games fit into this mode of thinking. The most successful handheld franchises – Pokemon, Animal Crossing, Cooking Mama, Professor Layton – they’re all reasonably complex experiences, but they’re also really, really cute. They fit the form factor – both physically and psychologically.Animal Crossing – Nintendo has always understood that we equate cute form factors with cute gamesPhotograph: ObserverThe PlayStation Portable wasn’t cute. Vita isn’t cute. Both tried to compete, in industrial design terms, with home consoles and with smartphones, dropping into an awkward aesthetic space between the two. When gamers first saw Ridge Racer on the Sony PSP they gasped in wonder – a true console experience on the go – but it turned out that not many people wanted that; not just because PSP was more expensive, but because (to a lot of people) it just felt weird to sit on a bus with this ostentatious piece of cold, sleek gaming technology.The idea of the Vita as a mini PlayStation 3 or 4 has stifled the creativity of developers. Stunted compromised spin-offs of major console titles like Uncharted and Call of Duty have done very little except underline the differences between a home machine and a portable gadget. They didn’t work. It’s no coincidence that the most successful series on Sony’s handheld machines – Monster Hunter – is very much in the Nintendo mould of highly sociable titles with childlike collection systems.Monster Hunter has proved one of the most successful brands on PlayStation handhelds because it is social and sharable. This dedicated Gathering Hall was set up for fans in London in 2009Photograph: PRSony has tried to innovate in hardware terms with OLED screens, proprietary memory card formats, proprietary optical discs and strange touch pads underneath the display. But these have usually been ignored by developers and read by consumers as a way to gouge more money from them. The philosophy of the home console race cannot be applied to the portable market because the consumer mindset is totally different. Sony may have had more success if it had really,reallypushed the product as a homebase for offbeat experiments and indie projects – there have certainly been plenty of those along the way. But the marketing attention was often elsewhere.The GameBoy, the DS and the 3DS haven’t just dominated this sector because they got the basics right – battery life, cost and sturdiness – they dominated because Nintendo understands that small things are cute and that cuteness pervades the whole experience. This is exactly what’s going on in the smartphone sector with Candy Crush, Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds. Bringing a game like Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer into work or school is a very specific experience that has nothing to do with technology or gadgetry.The Vita hasn’t really struggled because of mobile games, it has struggled because people don’t want to hug it.
When media types talk about YouTube and football, there is often speculation that Google’s online video service will at some point throw its hat into the ring for live rights – whether the Premier League or World Cup.Yet the company’s latest football move is more about backing the underdog, British channelCopa90, with a high-profile advertising campaign involving online ads and billboards around London.Copa90 is one of two channels – the other is cookery channelSorted Food– to get such a campaign this year, following in the footsteps ofZoella, Vice News and the SlowMoGuys in 2014.For Copa90, the campaign is the reward for steady growth on YouTube since it launched in 2012. It is averaging nearly 3.6m views and 13.8m minutes watched every month, and recently reached the milestone of 1 million subscribers.Tom Thirlwall, chief executive of parent company Bigballs Films, said the campaign is “designed to reach every single 16- to 24-year-old football fan in the UK”, and sees it as a much more logical sports strategy for YouTube than entering the live-rights market.“YouTube always champions the alternative: the independent outsider. For them to just go chasing after sports rights would have never made sense to me,” said Thirlwall.“The fact that they’re championing us, though; who knows where we’ll be in terms of rights when it comes to Rio next year [for the Olympic Games], the Euros, the next World Cup? We might be bidding for rights ourselves, or being brought into rights packages because those rightsholders want a younger audience who they’re not getting on TV.”When Copa90 launched in September 2012, the company had decided against seeking live or highlights rights, preferring instead to create its own “digital-native” formats, aiming to tell the stories of football fans that the mainstream media only touched on at best.Copa90’s latest promotional video.“I think we’ve started a disruption, and an analysis by the major sports-media businesses as to how you actually engage with young fans. These companies are straight one-to-many broadcasters, employing ex-footballers in suits to talk about the games,” said Thirlwall.“It’s all highly agenda-ed and planned, and anyone under the age of 30 is basically saying to us that it just doesn’t resonate with them in any way. These are the people who are watching goals on Vine, viewing streamed games, and coming to us to find the stories that don’t get shed a light on elsewhere.”He claimed the 2014 World Cup showed this difference starkly, with traditional broadcasters housed in the same building in Rio, while Copa90 “had presenters on deckchairs on the beach, up in the jungle, in the fan parks, in the bars and in the taxis with the fans … all the fun was happening outside the hermetically-sealed boxes of the television companies”.Copa90’s public rhetoric matches many other YouTube channels and multi-channel networks by talking up its appeal to young viewers and its disruptive role in the TV industry, while at the same time holding itself out as a potential solution for those broadcasters’ desire to win those fans back.“We could be seen as the greatest threat to linear-TV broadcasting of sport, but also potentially the clue to how they reverse that trend, and how we could become the biggest complement to that. We have that young audience, and we know how to move that young audience around,” said Thirlwall.Copa90 is not alone in being a potential partner for the broadcasters. In October 2014,Sky invested $7m (£4.6m) in online network Whistle Sports, then in September 2015 the pairlaunched a YouTube channel based around Sky’s Soccer AM show– a clear rival for Copa90.“They’re following our approach there. There is no greater flattery or compliment to what we’re doing to see Sky attempting to follow in our footsteps,” said Thirlwall.Copa90 has focused on football fans for many of its films.Like other YouTube-born broadcasters, Copa90 sees its main source of revenues coming from brands and sponsorship deals, with Bigballs’ executive team having cut their teeth working on commercial films for companies such as Adidas, Nike and Vodafone before launching Copa90.“We were at an advantage. We knew how to make credible, authentic branded content, and we took all that knowledge into the world of football,” said Thirlwall, who cheerfully slide-tackled the suggestion from some quarters of the online-TV world that the economics of YouTube are challenging.“We’re not ones to come out with negative opinions. If you think you can’t earn money on YouTube, you’re not thinking or trying hard enough,” he said.“A year ago, this was about survival, but now more and more brands and advertising agencies are looking at digital video and its power. It’s shared media. And the conversations we are having now are vastly different to a year ago, as we look forward to the Euros next year.”Sky and Whistle Sports will surely not be the last example of the sports broadcasters moving onto Copa90’s turf, but Thirlwall remained bullish about his company’s ability to compete – backed by YouTube – with the big guns of the broadcasting world.“Can and will the sports broadcast community come into this space? Absolutely. But the problem is that big media businesses always handle young audiences very clumsily, and often in a very patronising way. Ultimately, it’s very difficult to move away from their legacy business models,” he said.“They can never commit to it with the lack of fear and risk-taking sense of abandon that we had. It’s hard to go from being a top-down business where everything’s programmed and formatted to within an inch of its life, to throwing off those shackles and doing it in a different way.”
Amazon has made its first serious foray into the so-called“gig economy”, advertising for part-time delivery drivers in Seattle as part of a programme called “Amazon Flex”.The drivers, who will be delivering packages ordered through its same-hour delivery product Amazon Prime Now, will be paid between $18-$25 an hour to work for the company, but they have to provide their own car and Android phone.Amazon advertises the role to potential workers “be your own boss: deliver when you want, as much as you want”.“You can choose any available 2, 4, and 8-hour blocks of time to work the same day, or set availability for up to 12 hours per day for the future. You can work as much or as little as you want,” the company explained in an FAQ.The job advert plunges Amazon into the middle of an ongoing debate about the nature of work in a connected economy. Frequently referred to as the “sharing economy”, a reference to the fact that service providers at firms such as Uber or AirBnB are “sharing” their assets, such as their car or house, the new model has led to lawsuits in a number of countries.Uber, in particular, has beenrepeatedly sued by former driversarguing that they were in fact employees of the firm, rather than simple third-party contractors. That distinction has led to an alternative name for the trend, the “1099 economy”, after the US tax form which reports the pay of an independent contractor. But both “sharing” and “1099” economy fail to capture the evolution of the model; the latter ignores the fact that it exists outside the US, while the former emphasises who owns the assets being used, rather than who is doing the labour. One term becoming more commonly used to to refer to firms such as TaskRabbit, AirBnB and Amazon Flex is the “gig economy”, as it highlights the short-term, tenuous nature of the employment.This move isn’t Amazon’s first foray into that world. The company was actually a trendsetter in the field, with its Mechanical Turk service allowing people to earn a small amount of money for completing simple tasks which are easy for people but hard for computers. According to one report,the average “hourly wage” for a Mechanical Turk workerwas between $1 and $5 in 2013.
A co-founder of the Pirate Bay has been released from prison after serving three years for copyright and hacking offences.Gottfrid Svartholm was initially convicted in 2011, when his involvement with the bittorrent site led to a one-year prison sentence handed down in Stockholm, Sweden. Svartholm, also known as Anakata online, had been found guilty in absentia alongside three of his Pirate Bay colleagues for copyright infringement. He had avoided the trial, and no-one, including his lawyer, knew his whereabouts.Svartholm was later arrested in Cambodia in 2012, and transferred to Sweden to serve out his sentence. But in 2013, he was again charged and found guilty of hacking and fraud offences, leading to a further two years on his prison sentence. He appealed, and was cleared of one specific charge of hacking a bank, but a second conviction for hacking IT company Logica was upheld. As a result, his second sentence was reduced from two years to one.As that sentence was coming to an end, Svartholm was extradited to Denmark where he again stood trial for hacking offences. He was convicted and sentenced to another three and a half years in prison.He was released early for good behaviour in August, but promptly re-arrested upon his release and extradited back to Sweden, where he still had one final month of his hacking conviction to serve out in that country.In June, as he faced release in Sweden,his mother told industry news site TorrentFreak that“what Gottfrid wants to do now, more than anything else, is to get back to his developmental work within IT”.She added: “And, of course, first of all: to sit by a keyboard again after nearly three years away from one.”With Svartholm’s release, all of the original co-founders of the Pirate Bay are now free. Peter Sunde had been arrested after Svartholm, but released from jail before himafter serving his sentence in Västervik prison, south of Stockholm, while the last of the group, Fredrik Neij - known as TiAMO online –was arrested in Thailand in 2014.
Microsoft has responded to Windows 10 users’ privacy fears by insisting that it does not scan emails, messages or files for advertising purposes.When Windows 10 launched some users complained that Microsoft hadcompromised their privacydue to its default settings.It was later revealed that even when all data collection settings were turned off Windows 10still sent identifiable data to Microsoft.Now Microsoft has moved to clarify the types of data it collects. Terry Myerson, Microsoft’s executive vice president of Windows and Devicessaid: “No matter what privacy options you choose, neither Windows 10 nor any other Microsoft software scans the content of your email or other communications, or your files, in order to deliver targeted advertising to you.”Myerson explained that Windows 10 collects two types of data. The first is designed to help Microsoft and third-parties identify bugs or problems in software – items such as crash logs, system information and other diagnostic data.“This doesn’t include any of your content or files,” says Myerson. “And we take several steps to avoid collecting any information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or account ID.”Behavioural data for Cortana and personalisationWindows 10 also collects information on user habits in the name of personalisation. Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana collects the most, but it and other settings that remember preferences such as favourite sports teams and commonly typed words can be disabled.This type of personalisation and behavioural data is commonly used by other platforms for digital assistants and other machine learning processes that adjust to the user, such as Google Now, Siri and autocorrect software for keyboards.However, when all personalisation features were turned off Windows 10 was found tosend personally identifiable dataassociated with Microsoft’s OneDrive and an unknown content delivery network.Microsoft has been under fire from privacy advocates with some describing Windows 10 as the most invasive Windows yet. It has also seenissues with compulsory automatic updates, and has been seen todownload itself onto user machineswithout permission, but is considered to be thebest Windows version yet.Its rate of adoption is also higher than Windows 7 or 8 within the first few months, according to data from web analytics firm StatCounter, which saw Windows 10 account for 4.9% of desktop internet users in August. Windows 7 held the controlling 48.1% share of desktop internet users in the month.How can I move my files and programs to a new PC?Microsoft Windows 10 free upgrade revisited: seven more of your questions answered
We all know that video games offer us the chance to do things we’d never dream of doing in real life – robbing banks, slaying dragons, sorting falling shapes into the right position to make them disappear. Crazy stuff.But in structural terms, games are nowhere near as rebellious and anarchic as they appear. Most are packed with rules and frameworks which are specifically designed to restrict the player – and there is usually a central narrative that youhaveto follow if you want to see the end. This is fine in a lot of genres, where rules are obviously necessary to create a tight play structure. But only a select few titles labelled as “open world” or “sandbox” adventures let you completely and utterly shatter the experience intended for you by the developers – or at least punish you in an imaginative way.Look at the role-playing video game (RPG) genre. Most modern RPGs now opt for a non-linear open-world approach to design, which ostensibly allows players the freedom to explore and experiment. Presented with this sense of freedom, the first thing I tend to do is see who I can attack – and in an RPG, that’s usually the initial quest-giver; the non-player character (NPC), tasked with laboriously welcoming you to the world. So while some over-earnest high elf is telling me all about the 1,000 year war that has plagued the land of Graxitor, I’m just trying to decapitate him.While an over-earnest high elf is talking about the war that has plagued Graxitor, I’m just trying to decapitate himMost games will pretend this isn’t happening by having your attacks simply rebound harmlessly off your target while they carry on with their exposition. This is because there’s normally an overarching narrative and a carefully constructed backstory that the writers are desperate for you to uncover. Much more interesting though are the games that go beyond passively ignoring you and actively punish you for being a jerk. Some slightly bolder titles, for example, will have the quest-giver immediately destroy you in retaliation – which is the game designer’s equivalent of a slap on the wrist for being naughty.A very, very small number will actually let you kill the character and then quietly work out what to do about that. These games don’t so much smack your wrist as breathe a heavy sigh and mutter, “OK,that’show it’s going to be, is it? Fine, let’s see how you like it now”. My favourite example of this is Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind where you can openly and brazenly slay anyone who is trying to help you. It’s not until after you’ve committed the deed, however, that the game tells you the world is now doomed (oops) and that saving the file will mean you’re unable to complete the adventure. The core narrative is only a comparatively small part of Morrowind though, so you can still enjoy what is now an openly doomed and nihilistic existence.Later Elder Scrolls instalments carried this on to a point. You can rough house critical story characters in Oblivion for example but they don’t die, they fight you until you knock them down – then they simply get back up and talk to you as though nothing has happened. When Sheogorath, the all-powerful Madgod of the Shivering Isles, is giving you a quest, you can go ahead and attack him if you like – but he’ll smirk, freeze you in place and then teleport you into the air where you fall to your death. This is a fantastic (and contextually relevant) way to tell a gamer off. Unfortunately, The Elder Scrolls Online dispenses with this entirely and, while you can attack unimportant NPCs in towns (often by accident), key characters are immune to damage and all attacks simply warp through them.Bioware’s role-playing classicBaldur’s Gateallows you to kill your foster father in the prologue. He is far, far stronger than the player character, but it is technically possible and results in bringing the game’s story to an abrupt halt. Unlike in Morrowind, there is no “you’ve just broken the game” warning dialogue box – your character is simply stuck in the prologue forever. That game’s recent spiritual successor, Pillars of Eternity, carries this mechanic to a degree but if you kill a key character, it basically states that, once again, the world is completely doomed – at which point the game ends.Older titles, particularly point-and-click adventures, carried this feature more prominently in a way that’d be simply untenable with modern-day audiences. Forgetting to pick up an item, or carrying out tasks in the wrong order, wouldn’t only result in a game being impossible to finish, the game also wouldn’ttellyou it was impossible to finish. You could make a mistake in the first act, not realise, spend hours getting through the rest of the adventure and then unceremoniously die when you reached a pivotal moment in the story. Kings Quest, a lauded, brilliant series, would spring this on a player quite often and with its inane puzzles and baffling challenges it was easy to miss a mundane item that would turn out to be game-breaking later.The X-Files full motion video (FMV) game, which came out in the 1990s when the genre was considered The Future, is another interesting example. For all its faults the adventure did a lot to pull you into its world: you had a realistic PDA to check, you could use various items on people to get different reactions out of them – and you could pull a gun on any of the bureau staff, including Assistant Director Skinner, who would say “don’t do that”, like a parent telling you to stop sticking your butter knife in the toaster. You didn’t have to listen to him; indeed, you could pretty much shoot anyone and the game would (realistically, to be honest) end right there with a scene of your arrest. And there you were as a gamer, back on the naughty step until you played properly.Perhaps in the future, developers will allow more of the game experience to be governed by procedurally generated narratives and AI-assisted characters that can react in real-time to whatever you do. The random quests generated in titles like Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim hint in this direction, as do thereal-time personal rivalriesin Shadow of Mordor. One day, then, we may well get the freedom to be the players we want to be – even if we want to be assholes.

Analysts put sales in China at between 3m and 4m units, leaving sales elsewhere essentially flat year-over-year.My initial estimates were China could add 3-4 million units to iPhone launch sales and I think that was about right.&mdash; Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin)September 28, 2015The company allowed 16 days for its presale period (last year it gave itself 10) and the phone officially went on sale 25 September. It will continue to roll out around the world through October.“Sales for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any previous first weekend sales results in Apple’s history,” wrote Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a press release.The devices’ success is a testament to the reliability of Apple’s user base, said Ramon Llamas, a mobile market analyst for International Data Corporation (IDC).“The fact that this is an S version and not a whole new body type version speaks to how much clout Apple has with end-users out there,” Llamas said. “People usually wait for the new version, but there’s a sizable number that says: ‘No, we’d rather have the incremental version and move forward.’”The popularity of the devices is also likely to make for greater Apple Watch adoption, Llamas said – or at least to remove a barrier to Apple Watch adoption, since the watch only works with iOS devices.The phone’s major upgradesinclude what Apple is calling 3D touch, in which the touchscreen responds not solely to touch but to pressure, as well, and the standard camera megapixel and processor improvements. Llamas said he expects to see the “home” button disappear before long.
Every new smartphone is meant to be better than the last, but hardiness is often not included in that upgrade. Now the iPhone 6S has been dropped, bent, scratched and now submerged in water, how tough is it?Last year users complained about the iPhoneending up bentafter trips through user pockets. Testersthen took their thumbsto various other large and thin smartphones, including Samsung’s Galaxy Note series.This year saw Samsung claim a1.7 times strength increasewithin itsGalaxy S6 smartphonesto try and stop bending. Apple also switched to a stronger aluminium for its iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which it claims is harder, but is it and will it bend? Vlogger Christian from FoneFox put it to the test.Bending the iPhone 6S.The iPhone 6S Plus seems to be more resilient. Requiring two people to actually bend it indicates users are unlikely to do it by accident. Chalk this one up to positive consumer action from last year’sbendgate.Dropping and scratchingBending isn’t quite in the same consumer-issue league as dropping smartphones. The harder aluminium used in the new iPhone helps it survive drops on to its edges and back better than last year’s iPhone 6S, with fewer marks and deformations in the frame. Dropping it on to the screen still has a predictable effect, according to vlogger David Rahimi:Dropping on to hard floor.Apple claims its X-ion glass screen is the hardest in the business, and while it will stand up to keys, knives, grit and sandpaper are not the iPhone 6S’s friend, according to vlogger JerryRigEverything:Scratching and bending.Samsung’s Galaxy S6 with its Corning Gorilla Glass 4 can apparentlysurvive a Stanley knife blade, for comparison, but neither screen is a match for sandpaper or grit in the pocket.Taking a bathApple doesn’t claim that the iPhone 6S is waterproof, but it seems that the phone is a lot more capable of surviving a dip into water than last year’s iPhone 6 and most other non-waterproof or water-resistant smartphones.Are the new iPhones waterproof?The phones survived an hour of submersion in water, and continued working without issue. Even the exposed Lightning and headphones ports worked fine after the dip, andcontinued to do so 48 hours later, according to vlogger Zach Straley.Another vlogger wasnot so lucky with his testing, showing neither smartphone surviving unscathed after a 30-minute submersion, however.Both the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are heavier and thicker than last year’s iPhone and it seems Apple’s claims that they are more durable with harder aluminium frames stands up to testing. But whether they are waterproof seems to be up for debate.How pink is the new ‘rose gold’ iPhone 6S?Apple iPhone 6S and 6S Plus review roundup: stronger, faster, heavier
Want more from your television without having to buy a new one? You need a streaming box. Here are five of the best on the market.Now TVSky’s new Now TV Box is a cutdown version of the Roku 2, with fewer features and streaming channels but at at a much lower cost.Photograph: SkyCost:£15One of the cheapest and best media streamers around. It is a rebranded Roku 2, which costs £70, with Wi-Fi and ethernet connectivity.The black box, which is 18cm sq, sits on top of almost anything, but needs its own power adapter. It is fast and outputs video in 1080p and audio in Dolby Digital Plus.It requires a Now TV account and is limited to Sky’s excellent Now TV movies, entertainment and sport services, Sky’s pay-per-view store and a select number of catchup services, including BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, All 4 and Demand 5.There is no support for Netflix or Amazon’s Prime Video streaming services.Verdict:excellent value for money, but limited support for streaming services.Amazon Fire TV StickAmazon’s Fire TV stick with voice-control remote.Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/ReutersCost:£35 or £45The Amazon Fire TV stick looks like a USB flash drive and plugs directly into the HDMI port at the back of the TV. It is powered by a micro-USB cable, but needs to be plugged into its own power adapter.The remote can be pointed anywhere and the setup is incredibly easy: if bought from Amazon it comes with your details pre-loaded. There’s a simple how-to video when it is first installed too.The interface is slick, it needs an Amazon account and works best with Amazon’s £79 Prime service, which includes a video-on-demand service with a solid selection of movies and TV and a music subscription service with access to 1 million tracks.Other apps are available, including Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Spotify and more from the Amazon app store. The streaming quality is good, there’s a smartphone app for voice searches and if you own an Amazon Fire tablet you can mirror its screen on the TV.It also plays games such as Minecraft, Sonic, Tetris and Crossy Road and supports an optional Bluetooth games controller.Two versions are available, one with a voice-controlled remote and one without, with a £10 difference.Verdict:best for Amazon subscribers, but good value and support for most other services.ChromecastGoogle’s Chromecast can be powered by the USB port on your TV.Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesCost:£30This takes a very different approach to turning your TV smart. It acts as a receiver for your smartphone, tablet or laptop, using Google’s Cast service across your home network.It beams whatever is on your phone screen on to the TV, then uses the phone as a remote. There is no real interface for the Chromecast without a phone or laptop, beyond displaying background pictures, and so requires compatible apps such YouTube, Netflix and BBC iPlayer to work.Hundreds of Chromecast-compatible apps are available for Android and iPhone.It’s another small stick, which plugs straight into the HDMI slot on the TV, and can be powered by the USB port on your TV, unlike the Amazon Fire TV Stick.Verdict:simple to install and use, but requires a smartphone, tablet or computer.Apple TVThe Apple TV is probably the best looking streamer in the group, a simple black box with crisp lines.Photograph: Jamie Mann / Alamy/AlamyCost:£59One of the oldest streaming boxes available, the third generation Apple TV is currently available for £60, but anew version will be available in Novemberfor around £140 with a motion-control remote, voice search and apps.The current incarnation of the small black box can be controlled using a slim metal remote or via the Remote app on the iPhone or iPad, which makes entering text easier.Built around iTunes, the Apple TV is the only device here that can play movies and music from Apple’s digital store, but also supports Netflix, Sky’s Now TV service, YouTube and a small selection of other services.The Apple TV supports AirPlay, Apple’s version of Google Cast, which streams video using your home network from an iPhone, iPad or Mac and a compatible app, such as BBC iPlayer.Verdict:best for Apple users who want iTunes content on their TV and can’t wait till November.Roku 2The Roku 2 is a small black box, which isn’t quite as slick as Apple’s TV but is fast and has many more features and streaming services.Photograph: RokuCost:£70The same as the Now TV box, but with all the limitations removed. It is the Swiss Army knife of streaming boxes, with hundreds of apps and services called channels available in the Roku storeNetflix, YouTube, Google Play movies and TV, Spotify and many more are available, including all the catchup services such as BBC iPlayer, Sky’s Now TV and Sky Store and even the Firefox browser.Apps and games are available, including Pac-Man and Fieldrunners, while local media playback via the microSD card slot on the back is also good. The Roku can play content streamed from a home-media server too.The Roku’s universal search helps you find what you want to play and its movie recommendation service monitors what you watch and suggests other things you might like.The remote feels a little cheap and its reach isn’t very far for infrared, but the interface can be customised and is easy to navigate, even if it isn’t slick.The one thing missing is Amazon Prime video, which is available in the US Roku store but not in the UK. That might change soon.Verdict:the do-it-all streamer.Other reviewsTop 5 phablets for early 2015: Which is the best for big-screen smartphone lovers?Five of the best smartwatches for early 2015

Soon, ridiculing the idea of watching other people play video games will seem ridiculous in itself. People do, and in increasingly large numbers online.YouTube has“hundreds of millions” of people watching “billions of hours” of gaming videosevery month, with its top 100 games channelsgenerating 7.3bn video views in July 2015 alone.Meanwhile Twitch – the service bought by Amazon in 2014 – hasmore than 100 million monthly viewerswatching its live and archived gaming video-streamsfor an average of 1.5 hours a day.Related:Google launches YouTube Gaming to challenge Amazon-owned TwitchTogether, YouTube and Twitch have made games – from walkthrough “Let’s Play” videos to live eSports tournaments – one of the fastest-growing television genres, almost entirely outside the traditional television industry.For most of this category’s history, YouTube and Twitch have not been in direct competition: YouTube’s gaming focus was on videos shot, edited and uploaded to its service, while Twitch’s was on live streams of gameplay and chat.In the space of the last month, though, that has changed. First, YouTube launched itsYouTube Gamingapp, with its emphasis on live streams as well as recorded videos accompanied by new features for channels streaming gameplay live on the service.Now Twitch is moving into YouTube’s heartland of recorded videos. The company has announced plans to enable its broadcasters to upload videos to their channels, as they would to YouTube.Twitch users will also be able to create playlists from their archives, essentially meaning their channels broadcast 24 hours a day, rather than only when they are online and streaming live.Both YouTube and Twitch are making a similar pitch to their video creators: use one service for everything, rather than dividing their attention between two. Until now, many games broadcasters have used both services: uploading videos to YouTube and streaming live on Twitch.Minecraft gamer Jordan “CaptainSparklez” Maron is one of the most prominent examples:his YouTube channel has 8.8 million subscribers, whilehis Twitch channel has 1.2 million followers.“So many people who I know, although they still do YouTube,Twitchhas become more and more of a major thing – myself included,” hetold the Guardian in August.“It’s a cool, different way to interact with people: they can give you direct feedback in the chat in Twitch, which is something you can’t get on YouTube. It works very well for games, and it’s a little bit more casual than YouTube: you can take a break, answer questions from the chat, and mess around a little bit more.”As YouTube gets more like Twitch, and Twitch gets more like YouTube, Maron and the emerging crop of gaming personalities will be choosing whether to throw their lot in with one of the platforms, or continue to divide their energies (and audiences) between the two.YouTube Gaming is unlikely to be a “Twitch-killer”, and vice versa: as more brands shift portions of their advertising budgets in the direction of these audiences, there is scope for both to prosper.Related:Twitch's co-founder on the curious appeal of watching gamers gameMeanwhile, the battle between two platforms backed bybig-techparents will be healthy, as YouTube and Twitch compete to provide new features for their creators and gaming viewers alike.For live streams especially, that’s important. This is a television format combining gameplay footage, video feeds of players and live chat between those players and their viewers – and between the viewers themselves. The language of this format is still developing, not to mention the business models around it.That’s why the competition between YouTube and Twitch is about more than each service adding new features to move on to turf occupied by the other.Too much of the outside world – the media industry included – still struggles to understand why anyone would find entertainment in watching other people playing games. But it’s those burgeoning audiences on YouTube and Twitch that are defining how their respective cultures and communities evolve, which will in turn be the key influence on this new entertainment genre.
It’s Monday again somehow.
Fruit Ninja has just turned five. The slice-and-dice game has been downloaded more than a billion times. That’s no small number, so its Brisbane-based creator, Halfbrick Studios, celebrated with cake.“One of the guys here who was from the team that made Fruit Ninja, his wife makes cakes,” says Halfbrick’s chief executive, 40-year-old Shainiel Deo.Shainiel Deo of Halfbrick Studios.Photograph: Halfbrick StudiosA reference to2007 puzzle game Portalsuddenly feels appropriate: was the cake alie? “You had to do it,” he laughs uproariously, before becoming intensely serious. “No. It was an awesome cake.”Making video games in Australia is also serious business and not for the faint of heart. Fellow BrisbanitesTHQ Australiaclosed in 2011, as did the Melbourne crewBlue Tongue. The last local AAA studio (industry code for a major production company),2K Australiashuttered its Canberra digs in April.It might have happened to Halfbrick too. Founded in 2001, for the company’s first seven years earnings primarily came from working on international projects. Then the global financial crisis hit, and all of a sudden Australia was no longer an affordable place to create entertainment products. With Halfbrick at risk of becoming Quarterbrick, and 70-odd employees at its Brisbane headquarters alone, that didn’t feel like a nice way to double down.So in 2010 Deo set himself an ultimatum: “Get rich or die tryin’”. He says the company began pitching sessions for game ideas, called Halfbrick Fridays. “Guys would get up and pitch an idea and, if someone else liked it, they’d join them and form a prototype. They’d go away and work on those prototypes every Friday for about six or seven Fridays.“I guess the goal for this particular Halfbrick Friday was an iPhone game your mum can play – and Fruit Ninja was the fruit of that.” He says when the idea was pitched, only one other person saw any potential in it, meeting the minimum criterion for a project to be kicked off. “Thankfully there was that one, otherwise that idea would have died on the vine, so to speak.”Related:Halfbrick launches maths-teaching sequel to Fruit Ninja mobile gameFruit Ninja grew to epic proportions in a relatively short amount of time. Launched in April 2010, by July it had hit 1m downloads. Soon after that itappeared on Mythbustersand the members of One Directiondeclared they were fansof “real-life Fruit Ninja” (slicing actual fruit in the air) – something Deo seems comically embarrassed by.In terms of marketing, the campaign was kept lo-fi, he says. “Everything was on a shoestring. If you look at our original Fruit Ninja trailer, I think it’s got at least two members of our development team. Our chief marketing officer at the time was holding the camera!”Deo attributes Fruit Ninja’s wildfire success to its slicey little mechanics and some fortuitous timing. In what seems familiar now, five years ago Fruit Ninja was one of the earliest games to showcase the simple and intuitive pleasures of touch devices. The game generated enough downloads to get traction on the Australian download charts. “Apple saw that and picked it up and showcased that to other countries, and then it just all exploded from there.”Deo says the game “put Australia on the map” in the gaming world yet few Australians outside the industry are aware Fruit Ninja is “locally grown”.Related:Pokémon Go: new mobile game will let you catch Pokémon in the real worldWith the gaming landscape anything but static, Deo says the company doesn’t take its position as a global leader in app-making for granted. “Apps aren’t the gold rush they were and the business models are changing all the time, too. When we first got involved it was all about paid apps, then it transitioned to ‘freemium’ and free-to-play based on internet purchases. Now we’ve been seeing the use of ad-supported apps.”Will Australia ever refocus its development lens on consoles and computers? “I don’t think we will, really, because the level of investment and manpower required is just so huge now, I think the risk is too great.”Mobile game apps still provide a lot of room for innovation and, as they are better integrated with people’s lifestyles, the market for them is “massive”, he says.“Not everyone can have the time to sit in front of their TV for two hours and play a AAA console experience. But everyone can pull out their mobile device and play for two minutes here and there and get a lot out of it.”
The Indian prime minister Narendra Modi seemed at home at Facebook headquarters on Sunday, in a town hall event seen by many as an attempt by Facebook to gain much-needed support for its expansive ambitions in India.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was certainly in a welcoming mood, changing his profile picture to include an Indian flag and writing: “I changed my profile picture to support Digital India, the Indian government’s effort to connect rural communities to the internet and give people access to more services online.”At the 50-minute event, both men became emotional. Modi told the audience women were vital to thefuture of his country, and came close to crying when he discussed his mother’s role in his life. She had struggled when he was younger, he said, in order to “make ends meet”.“A mother will never want you to become something; she will think about how you will achieve that,” he said. “I am from a very ordinary family, a very poor family. I sold tea in railway stations.”For his part, Zuckerberg told Modi about a little-known incident several years ago when, he said, Facebook “wasn’t doing so well”. The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, he said, urged him to take a spiritual trip to India and visit a temple there.The journey, Zuckerberg said, cleared his head and helped reaffirm Facebook’s mission to connect billions of people around the world.Related:Narendra Modi arrives for Silicon Valley tour as India's influence growsModi and Zuckerberg’s conversation turned, inevitably, toward economics andthe role of the internet and technology in India. That was why many of the Facebook workers present showed up.“We have been hearing from a lot of people here at work that India is a top priority, like China, and to have the prime minister here speaking it shows that there is a lot of excitement for us,” Paresh, a 37-year-old Facebook employee who declined to give his surname, told the Guardian.“I think we all, and especially us Indians, are looking forward to the opportunity to get moving in India.”Speaking to an audience of around 1,000, Modi said: “India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world today. My dream is to become a $20tn economy.“India at this point needs both physical and digital infrastructure,” he added, highlighting his government’s efforts to offer cheaper, localized internet services, an effort which has largely been made with the help of Facebook’sInternet.orginitiative.Given criticism in India of Facebook regarding its alleged promotion of its own applications and services over Indian equivalents, Zuckerberg and the Internet.org team hoped Modi’s visit would attract support.Gary Hopkins, 30, a web developer who has worked with Facebook on and off for a number of years, told the Guardian he was “interested to see what not only Modi had to say, but how Facebook would work the political game into trying to get more backing for their India efforts”.“It’s a huge market and we all know the importance of that,” he said.Gaurav Patel, a coder at Facebook, said the tech world and Facebook were uniquely capable of addressing challenges unique to India, due to the large number of Indians working in Silicon Valley.“I think we are heading in the right direction and have a ton of potential in India and we shouldn’t really talk about something that we don’t really know that facts,” he said.Related:Narendra Modi aims to bolster India's tech credentials on US visit“This is why Modi is here, so he can show his support for us Indians who have come to America to work, and now that there are chances for coming home and helping there, it is very hopeful.”Modi said social media had first been a personal interest and he had not expected to become prime minister when he started using Twitter and Facebook, platforms on which he now has tens of millions of followers.“It was about my curiosity towards technology,” he said.That curiosity has helped Facebook push into India. Modi said on Sunday that the internet helped him to govern. In the crowd, a few spectators mumbled about recent attempts by Modi’s government to censor and curtail internet viewership.The lead-up to the event was marked by a PR effort from Facebook. Chris Daniels, vice-president of Internet.org, discussed the role the company could have in India.“In April, I went to India and we heard the feedback from the community there that they felt that the platform was not as open as it could be to developers,”he told the Economic Times. “Both Facebook as a whole and Internet.org have a big role to play in the entrepreneurial ecosystem of India.”While Sunday’s event did not reveal any specifics about increased connectivity between India and Facebook, Zuckerberg was all smiles throughout.“I am personally impressed by the way PM Modi has used social media to connect with [the] people of India, be it women’s issues or to spread messages of peace,” he said.Outside the event, a small group of protesters demanded that Modi take responsibility fora 2002 massacre in Gujarat, the state of which he was then chief minister.Modi was due to complete his short California visit with an event at San Jose’s SAP Center, where 20,000 people from the Indian diaspora were due to attend. On Saturday, the prime minister toured electric carmaker Tesla and met top tech CEOs, including Google’s Sundar Pichai and Apple’s Tim Cook.On Monday, Modi was scheduled to return to the United Nations in New York, where he was expected to meet President Obama.

Much more than a gimmick, this revolutionises gameplay adding air, land and sea driving challenges to the campaign, as well as a standalone kart-racing mode.Each vehicle can be extensively modified by Supercharger Skylanders for enhanced performance, while online multiplayer gaming bolsters value in both racing and adventure modes, as does robust support for every Skylander character, old and new. Pleasingly, the high price can also be reduced with a budget download version that reuses existing portal peripherals.Activision have made a real forward move, with stunning visuals that createin a fantasy world bristling with secrets and inviting exploration. They’ve also included series regular Lock and Skystone puzzles, which have been revamped in keeping with the high attention paid to every aspect of the game. Having started the toy-game hybrid category four years ago, theSkylandersfranchise continues to offer a compelling experience for young players.ARTearaway Unfolded(PS4, Sony, cert: 7)★★★★★Paper view … Tearaway Unfolded offers a world of puzzle and adventure.Many players may have missed out on the originalTearaway, released on the tragically overlookedPS Vita. With the PS4 currently dominating players’ attention though, the time is right for developer Media Molecule to deliver its charming papercraft-inspired adventure to the audience it deserves.Yet this is no mere port. Where the handheld version made intricate use of the hardware’s unique features, the home version adapts the DualShock 4 controller into an indispensable link between worlds. Players assume a godlike role, affecting environment and narrative by shining light into the darkness, all the while guiding “messenger” atoi – or her male counterpart iota, both deliberately lower-case – to heal an ominous hole in the sky.Returning Vita players will find much that is similar in the game, though it is greatly expanded. Puzzles are remixed, new areas added, and a link to a mobile app provides intriguing new features.

On one side, Konami’sPES, and on the other, EA’sFifa.PES 2016arrives slightly earlier this time around, and there’s no doubt it is a very solid football game. It delivers exciting matches, and though the series has long been the footballer’s football game, it is today a title that knows just those moments when simulation should give way to the spirit of a captivating match.This newest iteration brings with it a bounty of modes, bolstered light management options, rather dazzling AI, and modestly understated presentation. The on-pitch action can feel a little lacking in physicality, but is rarely in intimacy or accuracy of controls.PES 2016also excels in making you play and think as a team, while still leaving ample space for individual flair. It should thrill both devotees and casual fans alike.WF

They made their displeasure clear with a night of strategic bombing. God only knows what they’d been gorging on, but they created a proper splatterfest. One of those you end up scraping at with a thumbnail. And I sort of agreed with them – not that I’d have expressed it in the same way.Some cars are so much more photogenic than others. In pictures the DS 5’s high bonnet and swirling chrome detailing give the impression of a nicely balanced vehicle, surging athletically up the road. But in the flesh it looks awkward: its bonnet and vast sweptback windscreen too big for its body, like one of those egg-headed dogs Princess Anne is so fond of.Rear view: the back of the DS 5, featuring the new logo and twin exhausts.I haven’t mentioned the C-word yet because, despite what you might think, this is no longer a Citroën. DS split from its parent company last year and its double chevron has now been replaced with a sinuous D kissing a flirty S.Launched 60 years on from the original DS, which still captivates with its curves and ingenuity, this DS probably won’t be celebrated in quite the same breathless way in 2075. However, DS is keen to establish itself as a constructor of premium cars which stand out from the crowd, and it has made every effort to combine ambitious styling with good comfort, dynamic technology and a decent engine.Step in and you’ll find an interior which is quirky and different, but not always in a good way. The seats are strikingly padded with leather blocks which look both retro and modern – especially in the Toffo-tan colour mine was. The dashboard is clutter-free thanks to half the buttons having migrated to a central strut overhead between the twin sunroofs (there’s also a third glass panel above the back seats). But rather than feeling light and airy, the interior feels oddly claustrophobic and unsettling.Inside story: the interior is light and airy thanks to the huge windscreen.The 1.6-litre BlueHDi diesel which I tested is economical and superbly quiet. You might be underwhelmed if you wanted to hare round corners, but on a long cruise it’s admirably unflustered and the fuel economy is excellent. The steering wheel feels big in your hands, which goes against the trend for smaller, sportier styles.Speed bumps are a tiresome issue round me – though not for my wife, who happily slams over them, bouncing the rear axle sickeningly into the air. I once persuaded the kids in the back to wear their cycle helmets to make a point, but that only encouraged her. However the DS 5, with its upgraded suspension, coped brilliantly, easing gracefully over every sleeper. However I’m not sure this new car will enjoy as smooth a ride further down the road.Email Martin atmartin.love@observer.co.ukor follow him on Twitter at@MartinLove166
The idea seems to be one from some dystopian novel: a world where every celebrity has their own internet channel, exhaustively promoting their brand to eager fans, who pay to tune in and watch their favourite stars selling themselves online.In truth, that future is already upon us. This month, four of the five Kardashian/Jenner sisters – Kim, Khloé, Kendall and Kylie – launched their ownsubscription-based digital hubsthrough media company Whalerock Industries. Fifth sister Kourtney’s hub is in the pipeline.The Kardashian channels, which are stuffed full of beauty advice (Kim), clothes and accessories to try (Kylie), fitness tips (Khloé) and travel and lifestyle inspiration (Kendall), are available online and as mobile apps, charging subscribers just under $3 a month. More than a million fans have signed up in the two weeks since their launch, withKylie’s app, which features the 18-year-old goofing around and recommending her favourite snacks (Oreos, Lucky Charms, Diet Coke and Strawberry Twizzlers, if you’re interested) proving particularly popular: it topped the Apple app store within hours of launching.That Kylie is the most adept at this new format should come as no surprise. As the youngest Kardashian-Jenner, she is a digital native who has grown up online and regularly talks to fans on Instagram and Twitter, on which she has 36.4 million and 11.5 million fans respectively. Asshe told technology site Wiredwhen her site launched: “[The app] is by far my favourite thing… I’m way more comfortable on [it] and I can just share what I want to share.”That last point is a particularly salient one in terms of what Whalerock Industries appears to be offering celebrities – the chance to cut out the middle man of old media and curate their own content. When the Kardashian/Jenners rose to fame, it was on the back of reality television, a genre now in freefall with ratings declining and a dearth of new hits coming through.Yet whileKeeping Up With the Kardashianspresented the illusion of life – with the family, tantrums, troubled love lives and all – it was, as is every scripted reality-TV show, driven by ratings and stage-managed by executives. The new digital hubs offer something different – after all, if your fans are paying to see your carefully chosen content, do you need a big splash in a celebrity magazine such asPeopleor even the higher-end brands such asVogue,ElleorVanity Fair?Khloe, left, and Kim Kardashian, second right, with their parents. The family were stars of their own reality TV show, Keeping up with the Kardashians.Photograph: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images“Celebrities are definitely extending their own brands online as a result of having the freedom to play with so many more platforms and to express themselves,” says digital journalist Emma Gannon, who founded popular bloggirllostinthecity.com. “Most famous people still do ‘mainstream’ work via big companies, but there is a lot to gain from having their own platform: whether that’s a blog, a newsletter or a YouTube channel, stars can have direct access to their audience like never before.”And for those who are prepared to offer the right mix of relatable “normality” and glamorous aspiration, the rewards could be huge. This is uncharted territory – a world in which the celebrity controls the content and the fans pay for the illusion of access and an insight in to their “real” world.Put another way, it’s the YouTube-isation of celebrity culture. When YouTubers such asZoe Sugg,PewDiePieandAlfie Deyesfirst rose to prominence, there was a lot of talk among branding and marketing companies about how to utilise their growing power, but the reality is that these new stars reach their fans without the need for huge campaigns and promotion. Earlier this month,Username: Evie, by Joe Sugg (Zoe’s brother and fellow YouTube star), which is described as being “created with help from writer Matt Whyman and illustrator Amrit Birdi”, became the fastest-selling graphic novel in the UK, entering the charts at number four.Anna Valentine, publishing director at Orion, believes that the current phenomenon is only scratching the surface. She is currently on tour with controversial YouTuber Olajide Olatunji, better known as KSI, promoting his bookI Am A Bellend, and says the tour has benefited from a strong interactive element, which included developing an app with exclusive content. “I do think an increasing number of celebrities will make the transition to YouTube,” she says. “YouTubers are generating more revenue through advertising and securing more lucrative brand partnerships than their counterparts in TV space.”Certainly, for a generation of teenagers, the likes ofJennie Jenkins,Patricia BrightandHazel Hayesare more famous than any A-List star. They relate to their “availability”, the way in which they are just like them, albeit with better hair and makeup skills and their own channels online. Last August, US magazineVarietycommissioned a survey on the popularity of various stars, only to discover the five most influential figures among Americans aged 13 to 18 were all YouTube stars, with the teenagers singling out the YouTubers’ “candid sense of humour, lack of filter and risk-taking spirit” as the reason for their appeal.Small wonder, then, that other celebrities are dipping cautious toes in these sparkling new waters. A report in theNew York Timessuggested that Whalerockhopes to “create app-based channels for 12-to-20 performers and brands by 2018”. It has already launched an app with rapper Tyler, the Creator, and is working on one with veteran shock jock Howard Stern. As the Wired piece about the Kardashians noted: “Social media has made it easier for [stars] to promote their causes on Twitter, but what if they no longer neededVanity Fairfor photoshoots? Or a production company for their films? So far, the internet remains complementary – one part of the Hollywood PR machine, not the main distributor – but that could change.”Cara Delevingne self-promotes to fans via a variety of social media.Photograph: Allstar/20th Century FoxLeading that change are the younger stars, who truly feel at home with the medium. While the likes of Cara Delevingne have long used social media to share intimate details of their lives with fans, increasingly a more vocal presence is called for. Thus model Karlie Kloss has a YouTube channel,Klossy, which aims to take fans backstage in her life “to the things you didn’t get to see before”, something which, in reality, translates to goofy videos made backstage during various fashion weeks and quick trawls through Kloss’s world travels. Meanwhile, this monthGame of Thrones’ starMaisie Williams launched her own channel, the winningly titled Random Moments of Madness With Maisie Williams, saying in her opening post: “I have a lot of friends who are in YouTube and I just find it really, really interesting what they do and thought I’d give it a shot myself.” Williams’s channel, in contrast to the slick Kardashian sites, is promoted as an irregular slot on which she’ll post “videos and sketches, stuff that pops into my mind”. Yet it’s as much about the brand as Kylie Jenner’s more polished hub.“Personal branding can be dismissed as a negative thing, due to all the corporate jargon surrounding it,” says Gannon. “But having your own personal brand is the way the world is going. Internet profiles have meant we’re all building online personas; you are selling yourself as a brand every day, even if you’re not aware of it through your cover photo, your opinions, your photos, your friends, your Instagram feed.”The erosion of traditional media is beginning to open the doors for talented artists who might have struggled to be heard. More than 200,000 people subscribe to actor and writerIssa Rae’s YouTube channeland her videos, including her hugely acclaimed web seriesAwkward Black Girl,have been viewed more than 2 million times. Rae landed a TV deal with HBO on the back of that success.Insecure, about a woman on the verge of turning 30, was approved for development last December, although Rae has talked of her frustration at the time it has taken to turn this project around compared with making shows in her bedroom.It’s this sense that you’re almost in the bedroom with the person you’re watching that companies are so keen to pin down, not least because it’s a potentially lucrative source of advertising and money. The Kardashian hubs are filled with their recommendations for all kinds of products, and the hope is, presumably, that fans will jump on those suggestions and buy them.“I often think the Kardashians are the queens of native advertising,” says Gannon. “They are seamless at selling themselves, and selling while they do it. They sell without you noticing and no one minds because they are so interesting to follow, apparently. It’s just an extension of their brand and their personality.”However, celebrities eager to sign up to this revolution should be wary. “A note of caution,” says Valentine. “The reason YouTubers are building such huge audiences is that they’re wholly authentic. They’re producing content they love, content they know subscribers will engage with. It’s a genuine transaction. Viewers can see through videos that are thinly veiled adverts … only those who produce brilliant content will rise to the top.”
When news broke that the publishers of fantasy card gameMagic: The Gatheringwere working on a board game set in the series’ fictional universe, fans reacted with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. In the 22 years since it was first released, the game has hooked an estimated 20m players with its blend of compelling storylines and strategic gameplay. A poorly-executed adaptation would leave a lot of people disappointed.Fortunately, Arena of the Planeswalkers may be the best tabletop game released this year.A fast-paced skirmish battle game, it sees you and your friends take command of armies of creatures led by “planeswalkers”, the powerful, dimension-hopping mages who serve as the central characters in Magic’s ongoing plot. Over the course of about an hour, you’ll summon units to the modular hex-grid battlefield, engage in vicious combat and cast deadly spells in an effort to slay your rivals and emerge as the last man, woman or woodland elf standing.It’s all very dramatic, but Arena of the Planeswalkers actually starts out as quite a low-key affair. Each player begins the game in command of just a single character – their planeswalker – represented on the battlefield by a miniature plastic figure. As the game progresses, you’ll summon more creatures to join the fight, until the board becomes a glorious, swirling, chaotic melee.Each unit you bring to the fray is accompanied by a card outlining its abilities – the number of spaces it can move, the amount of damage it can endure and its skill in attacking and defending in combat. But as well as these basic stats, each unit boasts special powers allowing it to do things that others can’t. The red player’s “firecats” can move and attack as soon as they’re summoned on to the board, making them an immediate threat. The blue player’s phantoms can move through enemy figures as if they weren’t there. The black player’s zombies smell so bad that any enemies who come near them suffer a penalty to their defence rolls.Game-changing spellsUsing these abilities to their best effect is a huge part of the game, but you’ll also have a collection of magical spells at your disposal, represented by a personal deck of cards. You’ll draw one of these at the start of every turn, and they can affect the battle in a number of potentially game-changing ways. Some simply deal damage to opposing creatures, others beef up your own troops’ abilities, or disrupt your opponent’s plans by countering their spells or forcing them to discard cards from their hand.Individually, none of these spells are necessarily all that powerful, but play them at just the right moment, or in just the right combination, and they can completely change the course of the game. In this respect, Arena of the Planeswalkers is much like its card-based older sibling. You can conceive and execute a winning strategy, only for your opponent to play a masterful turn leaving your forces in tatters as you desperately try to improvise a plan B.Arena of the Planeswalkers’ plastic miniatures are a disappointing aesthetic failure in an otherwise excellent game.Photograph: Owen Duffy for the GuardianAll of this happens at a pretty blistering pace. The board quickly fills up with opposing units, and there is minimal preliminary manoeuvring, leaving you to get straight down to some thoroughly satisfying combat. The turn structure itself also keeps the game moving along quickly, with each player activating, moving and fighting with just a single one of their units on any given round, meaning that a complete turn rarely takes more than about a minute.This means you’re never waiting long for your next turn to come around, even with four or five players at the table. But it also throws up some interesting tactical dilemmas. Often you’ll find yourself with two or three situations on the board which all require your attention at the same time. Knowing which crisis you have to deal with right now and which can wait one more turn can mean the difference between victory and defeat.Like someone failed at using a 3D printerThis is an astonishingly good game. It’s easy to learn, but packs genuine depth. The dice-based combat system is simple and intuitive, and multiplayer games in particular are an anarchic, violent joy with players forging alliances and stabbing one another in the back with each passing turn.It’s also impressive just how faithfully the game adheres to the theme and flavour of the Magic universe. Each army feels very different to command. Where the white faction specialises in disciplined, coordinated attacks, red prefers to rush in with lightning-fast early assaults, lobbing fireballs at anything that survives. Where green units thrive on their affinity with nature and the survival of the fittest, the black army corrupts and weakens opponents before wiping them out with a tide of reanimated undead horrors.But while Arena of the Planeswalkers does so many things well, it does have one glaring weakness.The plastic figures included in the box are among the worst components I’ve ever seen in a board game. They’re god-awful, like someone’s failed first attempt at using a 3D printer. This would be offputting in any game, but in one based on a franchise that’s given us some of the most beautiful fantasy artwork in all of gaming, it’s a near-unforgivable oversight.It’s the kind of production mis-step that could conceivably cause people to overlook the game, and that would be a pity, because it’s a joy to play. It’s also a game that’s going to grow. The core boxed set, which sells for £29.99, comes with five small squads that have clearly been carefully balanced against one another. But an ongoing series of expansions will offer new commanders, units, settings and scenarios, allowing players to construct their own personalised armies and spell decks and develop new strategies in the months and years to come.This is a game to get your teeth into, and one that could easily become an obsession. Whether you’re a player of its trading-card predecessor or not, this is a must-play for any strategy fan.
The Kia Sorento is the kind of car that will cause acquaintances to ask, “What are you driving now?” when you arrive. If you like that kind of thing – and God knows, I love it – you’ll burst with pride. It has a slightly militaristic exterior, more imposing in black, I should think; in white more redolent of plain money. It’s long, wide and low, spacious inside, bullish on the road. There are potentially three rows of seats, though I never needed them and left the boot as was. As low as it is, the boot is an extremely high jump for an elderly dog, not that I would ever put a dog in his twilight years in a review car, oh no.City driving, as with anything not designed for a city but that city people love to drive, is not ideal: it’s sluggish in the lower gears. If you’re in first and second a lot, you may feel vexed by the effort. But cruising is a pleasure: give it an A road or a motorway and it will take care of itself. The acceleration is confident, the steering is true, the traction is reassuring, the handling invites trust, the leather seats make you feel as though everything’s going to be OK.The driving position is well thought-out, everywhere from the posture to the armrest. The room in the cabin really tells if you’re one of those people who lurches into a car with two litres of water and a load of handheld devices you forgot to charge. The satnav, from its classy 8in screen to the intuitiveness of its controls, is a pleasure: it is one of the injustices of the world of cars that you feel moved to comment on satnav only if it sucks. Then, once in a while, it’s great, and you remember to mention it.It is the first time, by popular lore, Kia has ever come up with anything you’d want to spend 30 grand on, so they’re naturally pretty proud. 0-62mph in nine seconds is quite fun, though you never feel as though you’re taking off. It has the safety features du jour, which revolve mainly around an insane number of airbags and a lot of alarms – blind spot, lane discipline and rear cross traffic alert (this translates in the real world into a noise you don’t understand, until the hazard passes you or recedes) – and the fuel consumption is decent.The question is, would you fall in love with it? If you think of SUVs as a bid for status, then a moderately priced one would seem pointless. But if you genuinely need a giant car that a dog can’t get into or out of, then it’s a good, solid, novel entry into the class.Kia Sorento: in numbersPrice£35,845Top speed124mphAcceleration0-60mph in 9 secondsCombined fuel consumption46.3mpgCO2emissions161g/kmCool rating7/10Eco rating6/10
For the second time in less than three years, Google is under investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over antitrust concerns, Bloomberg reported Friday morning.The inquiry will look into whether the company’s Android operating system has violated antitrust laws by privileging its own products and services over its competitors’ to an untenable degree, according tothe Bloomberg report, which cited competing tech company executives who had complained about Google to the commission.Both the FTC and Google declined to comment, the former saying that it does not comment “on an investigation or the existence of an investigation”.Google has been the target of several recent complaints, many to do with its advertising networks – a business worth an estimated $5bn according to industry analyst Brian Weiser. A European company called Disconnect complained to the European Commission (EC) earlier this year that its app, which isolated search functions like Google’s from Google’s trackers, had been repeatedly thrown out of Google’s app store.Others have voiced concerns to the FTC over the company’s YouTube Kids app, which they sayunfairly exposes children to targeted advertisingfor unhealthy food, among others.Google is currently under investigationby the European Commission, as well. European antitrust laws are less lenient that American rules, said NYU law professor Eleanor Fox, whose focus is trade regulation.In an investigation into anticompetitive behavior, the FTC “would have to prove that [Google’s] conduct creates or increases market power”, said Fox. “In the EU, it’s a level playing field argument, and a competition on the merits argument. The US says that’s not enough. You have to go further and prove that prices will go up and that less will be produced.” With relationship to advertising, Fox said, those arguments are abstract and hard to make.The FTC investigated Microsoft in 1993 over misuse of its market share through product bundling; that investigation closed but the Department of Justice then sued the company in 1998 over the same concerns, specifically its promotion of its own Internet Explorer over Netscape Navigator.More recently, the FTC voted 5-0 inearly 2013to cease investigating the company (citing lack of evidence), but not until Googlehad agreedto change business practices including restricting access to advertising platforms that compete with the company’s own.
