A welcome addition to the 3DS canon,IronFall: Invasionbrings a much-needed third-person shooter game to the console. Set in 2015, and following an alien attack, it places the player in the heart of the action as part of a guerrilla resistance group. This is, by shooter standards, all fairly standard stuff, as is the gameplay – through buildings and crumbling war zones – using the usual cover, run, jump and shoot combinations.Beating a stage unlocks secondary challenges that extend the experience, but it’s the multiplayer that will last longest, combining standard free play online modes alongside more strategic two- and three-player team matches. There is a range of controls, but 3DS models without a second analogue stick fare less well in this respect, and even with updated hardware, precision can be elusive.PerhapsIronFall’s great achievement is that it is visually impressive on the diminutive hardware, proving that graphically intense shooting games can work on the 3DS; but it fails to innovate further.
Price £181,865MPG 20.8Top speed 155mph“Lipstick, nail varnish, shoes, handbags, plastic storage bin, Red Setter…” James, Rolls-Royce’s jovial UK communications director, is listing some of the items customers have used as inspiration for their personalised Rollers. “Our cars are bespoke,” he says, “and our customers commission cars to tell the stories of the big events in their lives – new babies, big birthdays, marriages. We work with each of them to give them exactly what they want.”But what if they want some hellish vulgarity? Don’t you have a duty of care? Shouldn’t you protect them from themselves? Over James’s shoulder I can see a shockingly pink half-built Ghost easing its way along the production line. “Well,” James smiles, “we might say something along the lines of: ‘Sir, that’s a lovely idea, but perhaps this spectrum of colours will work even better.’” Advice Mr Pink clearly ignored.James is showing me around the dazzling, architect-designed Rolls-Royce factory at Goodwood. It’s a factory but not as you know it. There’s no noise, no rush, no clutter, no oil, no pin-ups. With its grass roof and lakeside setting, it feels more like a spa and I keep expecting someone to hand me a fluffy white robe.Rolls-Royce has been here for 11 years. Before that it was up in Crewe and the move south (not to mention being bought by BMW) has done wonders for the grand marque. Last year it sold 4,063 cars: its fifth successive record year. That’s a 20-a-day habit – a low volume that guarantees the prized rarity of each Rolls. Each one is created solely for its prospective owner and the 1,500 craftsmen and women who work at Goodwood are used to seeing a procession of major aristos and minor plutocrats touring the place as they make their minds up.Pure luxury: the car’s plush interior.Many of the new cars head for China and the Middle East – the former are almost always black on the outside (for status) and red leather on the inside (for luck), the latter are far more garish and whimsical in their tastes. A sizeable number of Rollers now also head for America and the dotcom entrepreneurs of the West Coast. If you are labouring under the idea that the RR is all about old buffers puffing on cigars in wood-panelled clubs, you are way off the mark. They are now hip. This is because, in the cash-drenched world of the under-30 billionaire, it is tellingly cool to avoid the brashness of the playboy supercar.It’s also partly because of the arrival of this car – the Ghost. It has been nicknamed the “baby Roller” and compared to its gargantuan sister, the Phantom, it’s cheap and drivable. Apparently today’s arrivistes like to be driven during the week and drive themselves at the weekends, you know, for fun.And this new Ghost, the Series II, is so beautifully balanced, so graceful, so effortless, that within seconds of taking the wheel I’d be sacking the chauffeur, if it was down to me. Its delirious V12 engine is almost totally silent, yet it casually blasts you and this two-tonne baby to 62mph in less than five seconds. It’s astonishing.I spent a few joyous hours off the leash with the Ghost in the quiet lanes around West Sussex before returning to the factory. Pulling up, I realised I’d now taken the tour and the test drive and had arrived at the exact point where five months earlier, some bloke had looked at James and said: “Yes! And I’d like it in pink.”Email Martin atmartin.love@observer.co.ukor follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166Follow the Observer Magazine on Twitter@ObsMagazine
A small and scholarly laboratory in north London is home to a very unusual chair. Its scarlet plastic bucket seat is suspended in the air on black hydraulic elbows, and coloured wires and pipes straggle around it like blood vessels. It is a mean-looking thing, but this uninviting piece of furniture is the product of three years’ work by scientists and designers from two universities, and could represent the beginning of a new breed of theme-park rides.The project’s doting parent is Brendan Walker, an artist-engineer who, in his capacity as an academic at the universities of Middlesex and Nottingham, has assembled a large, multidisciplinary team of scientists and designers to create and connect the ride’s numerous constituent parts. The result is a “multi-reality experience”, combining virtual reality, neurological data and a pneumatic “motion-platform”. More simply, it is a thrill ride designed to react to its occupant’s thoughts.“One feature of rides over the past 200 years at fairgrounds and theme parks is that they’re one-size-fits-all,” says Walker. “The question is, will rides of the future adapt to their riders individually?” If the team is successful in its endeavour, the finished ride will do just that: provide a unique experience for each person who tries it, and even train them to use their mind in a particular way. “That’s a satisfaction you don’t often get in modern rides,” says Walker, “I think the idea that you might be able to learn to control and influence the ride, and actually be rewarded for that, I think that will be a unique thing.”The rider must wear two separate sets of headgear: a headset over their eyes which provides the ride’s virtual visual world, and an encephalograph on their scalp which detects electrical activity from 14 areas of the brain. When wired up the rider will find themselves tumbling through a colourful tunnel. The seat will jolt around in response to their head movements, and they must try to control their thoughts if they hope to control the ride. Walker has mischievously named his creation “Neurosis”. “It’s a play on the cheesy names that rides have at fairgrounds”, he says. “It suggests that, somehow, people are going to be unsettled or permanently scarred, when in fact all they are doing is sitting on a wiggly chair at the top of a scaffolding tower.”At next month’sFutureFest, 100 volunteers will put Neurosis through its paces. “Like any unstable system, we may overshoot, we may bounce around horribly,” warns Walker breezily. “We may find someone who’s timid, that we scare terribly.” The idea, though, is that each volunteer’s electroencephalogram (EEG) data and personal testimony will be fed back into the software to improve the experience over the course of the two-day festival. As Walker puts it, “the ride will be taught to be more effective by the Sunday night than it was on the Saturday morning”.Before they even reach the chair, however, each volunteer will be ceremonially marched up a staircase in front of a crowd of onlookers. “People aren’t used to performing in front of others,” says Walker, ”and that tension creates a level of apprehension, anxiety. That’s a power I can continue to use through the performance.” In his red overalls and disarming sideburns, Walker cuts a theatrical figure, and identifies himself as equal parts scientist and vaudevillian ringmaster. “The fairground showman is very much the character I take on in the productions I create,” he says, and this interest in theatrics is an important part of how Neurosis will operate: as an extravagant performance, with Walker as its questionably benign director. “If I can match a rider’s trajectory to what I’d envisaged, I’ve got complete control over them,” he says, “so, like Hitchcock, I can take people through an emotional journey.”This is a sinister claim, and even in the comparatively unthreatening environment of the lab, approaching the chair is a matter of some apprehension. Perched on the seat with the headset on, the view is stunning, even peaceful, until I tilt my head and the chair reacts accordingly, juddering to the right with an angry hiss. Before long, the colourful panorama inside the headset is starting to spin and I have forgotten where the floor is, as the seat cranks in all directions. “Once you start being able to concentrate,” promises Walker, “you’ll actually start to stabilise,” and by the end of my three minutes I had begun to do this, though I am not surprised to hear the the ride will be attended by a box of sick-bags. I am unsteady when I emerge, but I am also flushed with excitement, and have even begun to “appreciate the beauty”, as Walker promised I would.Brendan Walker: ‘Fairground rides are a great collision of entertainment and technology. People experience it as entertainment, but then they can go around the back and see the Wizard of Oz.’Photograph: Sophia EvansAfter training as an aeronautical engineer and working on military aircraft, Walker studied at the Royal College of Art and went on to make interactive sculpture and installation work. Theme-park rides have provided him with the ideal outlet for this particular combination of interests, and he now works as a consultant on new rides at Alton Towers and Thorpe Park. “Fairground rides are a great collision of entertainment and technology,” he says. “People experience it as entertainment, but then they can go around the back and see the Wizard of Oz.”This last comparison is, perhaps, uncomfortably revealing. Oz’s wizard is an innovative showman, but he is also a phoney, and relies on dicey technology to manipulate his gullible subjects. EEG sensors of the kind used in Neurosis have beenthe subject of considerable scrutinyin the past two years, particularly since the maker, Emotiv, raised $1.6m on Kickstarter for its first commercial headset. If we are to believe that the technology behind Neurosis is legitimate, we must accept that the 14 sensors on the Epoc headset can accurately detect and transmit minute electrical signals escaping from the brain through the membranes and bone that surround it. We must then accept that certain combinations of these 14 signals can be reliably interpreted as one of four states of mind: engagement, excitement, frustration and meditation.This interpretation relies, according to Walker, on a “fairly well established algorithm, based on well published academic research,” but he admits that the science is far from “clean” and accepts that consumer EEG naturally attracts scepticism. Indeed, he almost seems to welcome scepticism as a necessary contribution to Neurosis’s performance, since all great fairground experiences depend, for their effect, on a measure of the improbable or incredible. Walker believes in the technology, and in the ability of the riders to learn to increase their “meditation” bar and be rewarded with a smoother ride on the chair. Nevertheless, he is unapologetic about the manipulative aspects at play: “If you allow yourself to be fooled, if you let the director take you on a journey… you allow yourself to believe that perhaps you are in mortal danger.” He returns again to Alfred Hitchcock’s capacity to manipulate his audience’s fears; perhaps predictably, his favourite Hitchcock isVertigo.To ramp up the tension of the Neurosis experience, Walker has engaged the services of a musician called The Mighty Jungulator, who has created a digital soundtrack that apparently responds to the rider’s thought patterns. Similarly, the virtual-reality tunnel through which the rider will careen is made up of stained-glass panels, also influenced by the EEG patterns. “The Oculus Rift [headset] effectively blindfolds [the rider],” explains Walker, “so when you’re immersed in that virtual world you lose a sense of spatial orientation. And because you’re going to be on a tower there’s the very real concern that you might be tumbling off the platform, so it’s a blurring of the tangible and virtual worlds.”This is the thrill that Walker hopes to provide, and even if the technology at work is, perhaps, imperfect, he takes pride in the ability to expose the public to such cutting-edge research. “Lots of people’s first experience of lightbulbs and waterwheels was at fairgrounds; it’s the perfect place for people to come and experiment with new technology. One of the strengths of Neurosis is that people get direct access to seeing just what the hell you can do with the brain these days, and to imagine what the implications are.”It is also, of course, simply a thrill: that shady injection of euphoria which, Walker believes, human beings crave especially in the secure modern world. If the premise of Neurosis is that everyone has their own individual appetite for adrenaline, I wonder what it is that gets Walker’s pulse racing. “I’ve always classed myself as a voyeur,” he blithely replies. “Observing people’s reactions, that gives me excitement.” He laughs and sits back in his chair. “Do I enjoy watching people being uncomfortable? Maybe. Maybe.”FutureFestpreviewTaking over the Vinopolis complex on London’s South Bank on 14-15 March, FutureFest aims to give visitors a taste of what the world might feel like in decades to come. Curated by Scottish musician Pat Kane, the programme features six themes: thrills, music, money, machines, democracy and the rapidly developing cities of Africa.

Pulling up, I realised I’d now taken the tour and the test drive and had arrived at the exact point where five months earlier, some bloke had looked at James and said: “Yes! And I’d like it in pink.”Email Martin atmartin.love@observer.co.ukor follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166Follow the Observer Magazine on Twitter@ObsMagazine
A small and scholarly laboratory in north London is home to a very unusual chair. Its scarlet plastic bucket seat is suspended in the air on black hydraulic elbows, and coloured wires and pipes straggle around it like blood vessels. It is a mean-looking thing, but this uninviting piece of furniture is the product of three years’ work by scientists and designers from two universities, and could represent the beginning of a new breed of theme-park rides.The project’s doting parent is Brendan Walker, an artist-engineer who, in his capacity as an academic at the universities of Middlesex and Nottingham, has assembled a large, multidisciplinary team of scientists and designers to create and connect the ride’s numerous constituent parts. The result is a “multi-reality experience”, combining virtual reality, neurological data and a pneumatic “motion-platform”. More simply, it is a thrill ride designed to react to its occupant’s thoughts.“One feature of rides over the past 200 years at fairgrounds and theme parks is that they’re one-size-fits-all,” says Walker. “The question is, will rides of the future adapt to their riders individually?” If the team is successful in its endeavour, the finished ride will do just that: provide a unique experience for each person who tries it, and even train them to use their mind in a particular way. “That’s a satisfaction you don’t often get in modern rides,” says Walker, “I think the idea that you might be able to learn to control and influence the ride, and actually be rewarded for that, I think that will be a unique thing.”The rider must wear two separate sets of headgear: a headset over their eyes which provides the ride’s virtual visual world, and an encephalograph on their scalp which detects electrical activity from 14 areas of the brain. When wired up the rider will find themselves tumbling through a colourful tunnel. The seat will jolt around in response to their head movements, and they must try to control their thoughts if they hope to control the ride. Walker has mischievously named his creation “Neurosis”. “It’s a play on the cheesy names that rides have at fairgrounds”, he says. “It suggests that, somehow, people are going to be unsettled or permanently scarred, when in fact all they are doing is sitting on a wiggly chair at the top of a scaffolding tower.”At next month’sFutureFest, 100 volunteers will put Neurosis through its paces. “Like any unstable system, we may overshoot, we may bounce around horribly,” warns Walker breezily. “We may find someone who’s timid, that we scare terribly.” The idea, though, is that each volunteer’s electroencephalogram (EEG) data and personal testimony will be fed back into the software to improve the experience over the course of the two-day festival. As Walker puts it, “the ride will be taught to be more effective by the Sunday night than it was on the Saturday morning”.Before they even reach the chair, however, each volunteer will be ceremonially marched up a staircase in front of a crowd of onlookers. “People aren’t used to performing in front of others,” says Walker, ”and that tension creates a level of apprehension, anxiety. That’s a power I can continue to use through the performance.” In his red overalls and disarming sideburns, Walker cuts a theatrical figure, and identifies himself as equal parts scientist and vaudevillian ringmaster. “The fairground showman is very much the character I take on in the productions I create,” he says, and this interest in theatrics is an important part of how Neurosis will operate: as an extravagant performance, with Walker as its questionably benign director. “If I can match a rider’s trajectory to what I’d envisaged, I’ve got complete control over them,” he says, “so, like Hitchcock, I can take people through an emotional journey.”This is a sinister claim, and even in the comparatively unthreatening environment of the lab, approaching the chair is a matter of some apprehension. Perched on the seat with the headset on, the view is stunning, even peaceful, until I tilt my head and the chair reacts accordingly, juddering to the right with an angry hiss. Before long, the colourful panorama inside the headset is starting to spin and I have forgotten where the floor is, as the seat cranks in all directions. “Once you start being able to concentrate,” promises Walker, “you’ll actually start to stabilise,” and by the end of my three minutes I had begun to do this, though I am not surprised to hear the the ride will be attended by a box of sick-bags. I am unsteady when I emerge, but I am also flushed with excitement, and have even begun to “appreciate the beauty”, as Walker promised I would.Brendan Walker: ‘Fairground rides are a great collision of entertainment and technology. People experience it as entertainment, but then they can go around the back and see the Wizard of Oz.’Photograph: Sophia EvansAfter training as an aeronautical engineer and working on military aircraft, Walker studied at the Royal College of Art and went on to make interactive sculpture and installation work. Theme-park rides have provided him with the ideal outlet for this particular combination of interests, and he now works as a consultant on new rides at Alton Towers and Thorpe Park. “Fairground rides are a great collision of entertainment and technology,” he says. “People experience it as entertainment, but then they can go around the back and see the Wizard of Oz.”This last comparison is, perhaps, uncomfortably revealing. Oz’s wizard is an innovative showman, but he is also a phoney, and relies on dicey technology to manipulate his gullible subjects. EEG sensors of the kind used in Neurosis have beenthe subject of considerable scrutinyin the past two years, particularly since the maker, Emotiv, raised $1.6m on Kickstarter for its first commercial headset. If we are to believe that the technology behind Neurosis is legitimate, we must accept that the 14 sensors on the Epoc headset can accurately detect and transmit minute electrical signals escaping from the brain through the membranes and bone that surround it. We must then accept that certain combinations of these 14 signals can be reliably interpreted as one of four states of mind: engagement, excitement, frustration and meditation.This interpretation relies, according to Walker, on a “fairly well established algorithm, based on well published academic research,” but he admits that the science is far from “clean” and accepts that consumer EEG naturally attracts scepticism. Indeed, he almost seems to welcome scepticism as a necessary contribution to Neurosis’s performance, since all great fairground experiences depend, for their effect, on a measure of the improbable or incredible. Walker believes in the technology, and in the ability of the riders to learn to increase their “meditation” bar and be rewarded with a smoother ride on the chair. Nevertheless, he is unapologetic about the manipulative aspects at play: “If you allow yourself to be fooled, if you let the director take you on a journey… you allow yourself to believe that perhaps you are in mortal danger.” He returns again to Alfred Hitchcock’s capacity to manipulate his audience’s fears; perhaps predictably, his favourite Hitchcock isVertigo.To ramp up the tension of the Neurosis experience, Walker has engaged the services of a musician called The Mighty Jungulator, who has created a digital soundtrack that apparently responds to the rider’s thought patterns. Similarly, the virtual-reality tunnel through which the rider will careen is made up of stained-glass panels, also influenced by the EEG patterns. “The Oculus Rift [headset] effectively blindfolds [the rider],” explains Walker, “so when you’re immersed in that virtual world you lose a sense of spatial orientation. And because you’re going to be on a tower there’s the very real concern that you might be tumbling off the platform, so it’s a blurring of the tangible and virtual worlds.”This is the thrill that Walker hopes to provide, and even if the technology at work is, perhaps, imperfect, he takes pride in the ability to expose the public to such cutting-edge research. “Lots of people’s first experience of lightbulbs and waterwheels was at fairgrounds; it’s the perfect place for people to come and experiment with new technology. One of the strengths of Neurosis is that people get direct access to seeing just what the hell you can do with the brain these days, and to imagine what the implications are.”It is also, of course, simply a thrill: that shady injection of euphoria which, Walker believes, human beings crave especially in the secure modern world. If the premise of Neurosis is that everyone has their own individual appetite for adrenaline, I wonder what it is that gets Walker’s pulse racing. “I’ve always classed myself as a voyeur,” he blithely replies. “Observing people’s reactions, that gives me excitement.” He laughs and sits back in his chair. “Do I enjoy watching people being uncomfortable? Maybe. Maybe.”FutureFestpreviewTaking over the Vinopolis complex on London’s South Bank on 14-15 March, FutureFest aims to give visitors a taste of what the world might feel like in decades to come. Curated by Scottish musician Pat Kane, the programme features six themes: thrills, music, money, machines, democracy and the rapidly developing cities of Africa. The event is run by the charity Nesta, the UK’s innovation foundation, and will be used to complement Nesta’s work as a research body and project funder.

Uber, the fast-growing and controversial taxi app, has its eyes on your pizza. As the company looks to expand beyond cabs – and shore up its$40bn valuation– Uber is getting into the delivery business.The San Francisco-based company has just launched UberEats which it promises “gets you the best meals from the best local restaurants in under 10 minutes”. The service is launching in Barcelona, just months afterthe Spanish authorities banned Uber from offering taxi services in the country. Uber’s Barcelona drivers will be available for food deliveries “seven days a week for both lunch and dinner”.“In the same time it takes you to walk up Las Ramblas you can open up your Uber app, choose your meal and get it delivered to an address of your choice,”Uber said in a blogpost.It comes two months after Uber launched a similar service, Uber Fresh, in Los Angeles. The company said it is “working hard to expand to other neighbourhoods soon”. Uber declined to comment on which cities it is planning to roll the service out to next.“Uber is a technology company, and innovation is what we do,” a spokesman said. “It’s in our DNA. We are always exploring different on-demand services and UberEats is one example of the innovative potential of our technology. UberEats shows how technology is creating convenience and choice but more importantly encouraging economic growth through innovation.”Analysts said they expected food delivery to be the first of several new services Uber will launch in coming months in attempt to justifythe sky-high valuation placed on the company at its latest venture capital funding drivein December.Douglas McCabe from Enders Analysis said: “Relatively small deliveries make a lot of sense. It’s the same model as delivering a person. Not least, there is probably spare vehicle capacity during the day. But Uber’s ambitions might be beyond that: you can envisage the strategy paper that shows how they ultimately aim to replace the private car in cities and arguably public transport.“One can list many barriers to the seamless delivery of that strategy, and there are many questions about what is more achievable in the US compared to Europe, but Uber may be able to gain considerable traction in verticals such as food deliveries.”Sam Hamadeh, founder of analyst PrivCo, said, Uber has pitched itself to venture capitalist as a future logistics company to rival UPS or FedEx and it is now attempting to prove to investors that is more than just a taxi app.“In documents shown to VCs it doesn’t emphasis Uber as a taxi, it pitches Uber as a logistics company – as being the solution to e-commerce solving the last mile delivery problem.“Rather than compare themselves to local taxi companies, they think think of their competitors as the US Postal Service, FedEx or DHL. They have to justify the amount of the money the raised at a $40bn valuation.”At $40bn Uber is worth more than big listed companies including Delta Airlines and Kraft. Hamadeh is skeptical that the company can live up to that promise but he said the company wouldn’t give up without a fight.“When VCs invest at $40bn they expect the company to go public at twice that. Uber is creating a cage for itself, it’s hard to imagine what the exit route is. It is too expensive to remain a taxi application. It has to expand into everything,” said Hamadeh. “Uber say they do not only want to defeat their competitors they want to crush them and leave them dead in an alleyway.”
Monster Hunter 4 UltimateNintendo 3DSMonster Hunter 4 Ultimate.Photograph: OtherThe monsters you’ll be hunting here are a menagerie of beasts, ranging from small herbivores to enormous fire-breathing behemoths that you have to team up with several other players to stand a chance at taking on. Monster Hunter is massive in Japan, where handheld games are already big business. But in order to appeal to territories where portable consoles are less popular, this version lets you team up online as well as over a local network, broadening your options for teammates and opening the multiplayer game. Other than that, and the addition of Palicos - giant talking cats that follow you around - this outing is similar to previous ones, in that you accept missions before heading out into hinterlands separated into discrete areas populated with different animals to slay. Staying alive means beefing up your weapons and armour, as well as frequent barbecues, roasting freshly slaughtered monster steaks on your portable grill before moving on to the next fight. Enduring entertainment for lovers of incremental upgrades.NICK GILLETTNintendo, £29.97-£39.99EvolvePS4, Xbox One &amp; PCEvolve.Photograph: OtherEvolve casts you as either a monster, or part of the team of four hunters who are trying to track down and kill it. Playing as the beast, your job is to run away, killing and eating snack-sized animals to power yourself up through three stages of evolution, at the end of which the hunters start to look small and puny. You can then begin smashing up whatever building the human team is fighting to protect. Playing as a hunter, you have more specialist roles to perform: assault soldiers inflict damage on the monster; trappers use their pets to sniff it out before fencing it in with a force field; medics heal fellow hunters and can tranquillise the monster; and support troops give temporary shields to teammates and call in air strikes. It’s an interesting departure for a first-person shooter, and the thrill of the chase delivers a hit of adrenaline whether you’re hunter or prey. Yet Evolve’s few game modes, and unlockable extras that take a serious investment of time or real money to access, mean that it’s not long before the tension gives way to tedium. ng2K Games, £26.25-£33Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy+Nintendo 3DSInset own ‘KABLAMMO’ here.Photograph: OtherWatching Top Gun might make being a fighter pilot look pretty wild, but capturing that thrill in a game has proved elusive. Video game fighter sims all too often degenerate into endless circling around enemies, with an occasional break to launch or evade a Sidewinder missile. Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy+ tries to get round this with quick-time events: arrows flash onscreen that you match by pushing the joystick in the same direction to ensure your plane avoids incoming missiles. There’s also an energy bar that when full lets you press a button to tuck in automatically behind an enemy. It’s a system that substitutes a frequent source of stalemates for a nuance-free mini-game, speeding things up, while not demanding much in the way of skill - but then Ace Combat has never been about flight simulation so much as making fighter planes feel fast and glamorous. It’s a fluffy, insubstantial joyride, simplified further to make it work on the handheld 3DS. ngNamco Bandai, £27.77-£29.99
It’s white, black and red, and everything that isn’t striped is festooned with a fancy piping; the Twingo looks like an 80s stereo or duvet cover. Its name autocorrects to “twinge”. I drove back from Winchester with a friend who thought the shiny red dashboard looked like a cream egg. It felt as though the wind might blow us into a new lane and I was glad of my friend’s weight, though it is by no means impressive. The Twingo is so light and nimble, it feels as though you could increase the heft of the car just by having a substantial meal. Having the engine in the back gives it an eerie noiselessness that makes the weather seem louder. It’s all in the mind, this stuff – in general, it is size not weight that tells for safety, and the manufacturers say this is their safest Twingo. Have a word with your prejudices (I’m talking to myself).Besides, motorways aren’t really the point of this car – the driving posture keeps you straight-backed and alert, raring for the roundabout, not the one-hand-on-the-wheel executive cruise. The dash tells you nothing but your speed. By contrast, there is a lot going on in the central bank, a pinch-screen satnav, and the ability to Bluetooth to a phone so seamlessly that you can discover your friend was listening to Sade before he’s even sat down.It fits five people with surprisingly little hassle, for such a pointedly small car (it’s the first time they’ve had a five-door model), though I wouldn’t want to overstate anybody’s comfort but my own (I was all right, Jack). The turning circle makes you drive like Michael Caine (I am a little bit cheeky, but hot damn, I’m good at it).Mainly because it is wee, partly because of the reversing camera, getting into a space was so neat and easy that I looked back in anguish at all the time I’ve spent trying to wedge a Passat into a resident’s bay. The fuel economy is about as good as it gets for a petrol engine, even such a small one – 65mpg in the Eco mode. I had Eco on most of the time, it didn’t have a noticeable impact on the acceleration, though don’t walk away with the idea that the acceleration felt effortless.I’m not sure that this car would feature in anybody’s wish fulfilment fantasy; but I think if you had already bought it, then been dropped into your fantasy life (as a ninja or a model or whatever), you would find it had more brio, welly and pizzazz than you expected.Renault All-New Twingo Dynamique S ENERGY TCe 90 Stop &amp; Start in numbersPriceFrom £12,545 (as tested £13,165)Top speed103mphCombined fuel consumption65.7mpgAcceleration0-62mph in 10.8 secondsCO2 emissions99g/kmEco rating7/10Cool rating6/10
The latest revelations from the NSA files have shown that US and UK surveillance agencies could have the ability to listen in on billions of mobile phone calls from around the world. But how can they do that, and what does it mean for the general public? And should you be worried?Related:Sim card database hack gave US and UK spies access to billions of cellphonesWhat’s happened?The biggest manufacturer of Sim cards in the worldhas reportedly been hacked into by the US NSA and UK GCHQ.The security agencies stole the encryption keys that are built into every one of the Sim cards made by the Dutch firm Gemalto.What is a Sim card?The Subscriber Identity Module (Sim) card is the small chip placed into almost every mobile phone in the world that allows the phone to connect securely to the mobile phone service provider. It is essentially the key that logs the user into the mobile phone network allowing calls, text and data access.The secure handshake between the network and the sim encrypts all communications going between the mobile phone and the network.What does this mean?With the encryption keys for Gemalto Sim cards, the US and UK security services can potentially listen in on any conversation across any network that uses the compromised Sim cards.How could they listen in?The keys allow the security services to decrypt voice communications sent between a mobile phone and a mobile mast, which carries the call to the recipient. To pick up the call they can use an aerial placed in the vicinity of the caller. They will have to be relatively close to the mobile phone user, but an aerial could be placed anywhere and would not have to be visible.Is this legal?There is no doubt that the security firms would have breached Dutch law. If the keys are used to listen into conversations, it is likely to be a violation of data protection laws in most countries.Where has this information come from?The revelations of the hack come from the NSA files supplied by Edward Snowden and reported on by Glen Greenwald’s The Intercept. The files reveal the extent of the breach and that Gemalto was targeted by the Mobile Handset Exploitation Team (MHET), a unit formed by the NSA and GCHQ in April 2010 to target vulnerabilities in mobile phones.Who is affected?Gemalto supplies 2bn Sim cards annually to 450 mobile phone providers globally across 85 countries. In the UK they are used by Vodafone, EE, O2 and Three, in the US by AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon.Most mobile phone providers will have used Gemalto sim cards at some point, meaning anyone with a Sim in their mobile phone could be affected.What can be done?There is very little that can be done to stop the US and UK security services using the encryption keys to listen in on mobile phone communications. That means someone could be listening in on any conversation had via the mobile phone network.Users can separately encrypt their voice and text communications using messaging services such as Apple’s iMessage, Facebook’s WhatsApp or secure chat services such as Chatsecure orUsers of Silent Circle’s Blackphone or similar secure services, which encrypt voice communications by default, will also protect phone calls.Related:Security services capable of bypassing encryption, draft code revealsDo I need to do something about it in the UK?While the revelations show that GCHQ or the NSA have the keys to your phone calls, in practice UK law enforcement already has access to that level of data through the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa). Law enforcement agencies can request historical data on a user’s phone use between explicit dates, or request live access to a user’s phone use.The UK mobile phone companies are compelled to comply with proper requests by law. Live access is generally used in immediate danger scenarios such as a kidnapping, where rapid access to communications data can aid an investigation in real time.Related:NSA surveillance: how to stay secure | Bruce SchneierWhat about the rest of the world?The encryption keys give the US and UK security agencies powers to circumvent resistance by other countries. If they wanted to spy on German president Angela Merkel, for instance, they could using the keys without the knowledge of German security forces, something that would not be possible through other legal means.What are the networks doing?In the UK, all of the major networks were only given the information on the breach at the same timethe Interceptpublished the details.They are currently investigating the security implications, although there is little that can be done without replacing the affected sim cards, as the encryption keys are hardwired into the sim cards and cannot be changed.EE, O2, Three and Vodafone said that they were speaking to suppliers of Sim cards about the implications of the revelations.
When Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates and Elon Musk all agree on something, it’s worth paying attention.All three have warned of the potential dangers that artificial intelligence or AI can bring. The world’s foremost physicist, Hawking said that the full development of artificial intelligence (AI) could“spell the end of the human race”. Musk, the tech entrepreneur who brought us PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX described artificial intelligence as our“biggest existential threat”and said that playing around with AI was like “summoning the demon”. Gates, who knows a thing or two about tech, puts himself in the“concerned”camp when it comes to machines becoming too intelligent for us humans to control.What are these wise souls afraid of? AI is broadly described as the ability of computer systems to ape or mimic human intelligent behavior. This could be anything from recognizing speech, to visual perception, making decisions and translating languages. Examples run from Deep Blue whobeat chess champion Garry Kasparovto supercomputer Watson whooutguessed the world’s best Jeopardy player. Fictionally, we haveHer, Spike Jonze’s movie that depicts the protagonist, played by Joaquin Phoenix, falling in love with his operating system, seductively voiced by Scarlet Johansson. And coming soon, Chappie stars a stolen police robot who is reprogrammed to make conscious choices and to feel emotions.An important component of AI, and a key element in the fears it engenders, is the ability of machines to take action on their own without human intervention. This could take the form of a computer reprogramming itself in the face of an obstacle or restriction. In other words, to think for itself and to take action accordingly.Needless to say, there are those in the tech world who have a more sanguine view of AI and what it could bring.Kevin Kelly, the founding editor of Wired magazine, does not see the future inhabited by HAL’s – the homicidal computer on board the spaceship in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kelly sees a more prosaic world that looks more like Amazon Web Services: a cheap, smart, utility which is also exceedingly boring simply because it will run in the background of our lives. He says AI will enliven inert objects in the way that electricity did over 100 years ago. “Everything that we formerly electrified, we will now cognitize.” And he sees the business plans of the next 10,000 startups as easy to predict: “Take X and add AI.”While he acknowledges the concerns about artificial intelligence, Kelly writes: “As AI develops, we might have to engineer ways to prevent consciousness in them – our most premium AI services will be advertised asconsciousness-free.” (my emphasis).Running parallel to the extraordinary advances in the field of AI is the even bigger development of what is loosely called,the internet of things(IoT). This can be broadly described as the emergence of countless objects, animals and even people with uniquely identifiable, embedded devices that are wirelessly connected to the internet. These ‘nodes’ can send or receive information without the need for human intervention. There are estimates that there will be 50 billion connected devices by 2020. Current examples of these smart devices include Nest thermostats, wifi-enabled washing machines and the increasingly connected cars with their built-in sensors that can avoid accidents and even park for you.The US Federal Trade Commission is sufficiently concerned about the security and privacy implications of the Internet of Things, and has conducted a public workshop and released a report urging companies to adopt best practices and “bake in” procedures to minimise data collection and to ensure consumer trust in the new networked environment.Tim O’Reilly, coiner of the phrase “Web 2.0” sees the internet of things as the most important online development yet. He thinks the name is misleading – that IoT is “really about human augmentation”. O’Reilly believes that we should “expect our devices to anticipate us in all sorts of ways”. He uses the “intelligent personal assistant”, Google Now, to make his point.So what happens when these millions of embedded devices connect to artificially intelligent machines? What does AI + IoT = ? Will it mean the end of civilisation as we know it? Will our self-programming computers send out hostile orders to the chips we’ve added to our everyday objects? Or is this just another disruptive moment, similar to the harnessing of steam or the splitting of the atom? An important step in our own evolution as a species, but nothing to be too concerned about?The answer may lie in some new thinking about consciousness. As a concept, as well as an experience, consciousness has proved remarkably hard to pin down. We all know that we have it (or at least we think we do), but scientists are unable to prove that we have it or, indeed, exactly what it is and how it arises.Dictionaries describe consciousness as the state of being awake and aware of our own existence. It is an “internal knowledge” characterized by sensation, emotions and thought.Just over 20 years ago, an obscure Australian philosopher named David Chalmers created controversy in philosophical circles by raising what became known as the Hard Problem of Consciousness. He asked how the grey matter inside our heads gave rise to the mysterious experience of being. What makes us different to, say, a very efficient robot, one with, perhaps, artificial intelligence? And are we humans the only ones with consciousness?Some scientists propose that consciousness is an illusion, a trick of the brain. Still others believe we will never solve the consciousness riddle. But a few neuroscientists think we may finally figure it out, provided we accept the remarkable idea that soon computers or the internet might one day become conscious.In anextensive Guardian article, the author Oliver Burkeman wrote how Chalmers and others put forth a notion that all things in the universe might be (or potentially be) conscious, “providing the information it contains is sufficiently interconnected and organized.” So could an iPhone or a thermostat be conscious? And, if so, could we in the midst of a ‘Conscious Web’?Back in the mid-1990s, the author Jennifer Cobb Kreisberg wrote an influential piece for Wired,A Globe, Clothing Itself with a Brain. In it she described the work of a little known Jesuit priest and paleontologist, Teilhard de Chardin, who 50 years earlier described a global sphere of thought, the “living unity of a single tissue” containing our collective thoughts, experiences and consciousness.Teilhard called it the “nooshphere” (noo is Greek for mind). He saw it as the evolutionary step beyond our geosphere (physical world) and biosphere (biological world). The informational wiring of a being, whether it is made up of neurons or electronics, gives birth to consciousness. As the diversification of nervous connections increase, de Chardin argued, evolution is led towards greater consciousness. Or as John Perry Barlow, Grateful Dead lyricist, cyber advocate and Teilhard de Chardin fan said: “With cyberspace, we are, in effect, hard-wiring the collective consciousness.”So, perhaps we shouldn’t be so alarmed. Maybe we are on the cusp of a breakthrough not just in the field of artificial intelligence and the emerging internet of things, but also in our understanding of consciousness itself. If we can resolve the privacy, security and trust issues that both AI and the IoT present, we might make an evolutionary leap of historic proportions. And it’s just possible Teilhard’s remarkable vision of an interconnected “thinking layer” is what the web has been all along.•Stephen Balkam is CEO of theFamily Online Safety Institutein the US
“User feedback was not positive,” Lenovo acknowledged on its website this week – while also trying to explain how customers could protect themselves against a serious security risk.“Visual Discovery/Superfish was previously included on some consumer notebook products shipped in a short window between October and December to help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping,” explains itsweb pagewhere it also explains how to remove Superfish, which has been tagged by multiple security researchers as a serious risk to user credentials.Lenovo says it “responded quickly and decisively” to news of the vulnerability. Superfish turned off server-side connections to Lenovo products, and claims it stopped preloading the software in January 2015. “We will not preload this software in the future,” Lenovo says firmly.So why did it install it in the past? A simple reason: the consumer PC market is so cut-throat that any extra revenue source becomes a godsend. Lenovo is far from the first to install extra software, for money, on the PCs it sells to consumers; but the surprise is that it did it at all.Lenovo is the world’s biggest PC maker, whose PC division managed operating margins of 5.4% in the three months to the end of December according to itsfinancial report; that means for every $100 of revenue from PCs, it kept $5.40 (£3.50) as profit (once taxes and other exceptionals are dealt with). Lenovo’s average PC sold for $570 (£371) in the fourth quarter, so its per-PC profit was $30.78.That’s well ahead of Asus ($394 average PC price, per-PC profit $18); only third-quarter figures are available for Acer (average PC price $339, profit $4.37) and HP (average price $580, profit $23.90). Dell hasn’t published public figures since going private, though its consumer PC division often struggled to break even. (I looked at what I call the“value trap” for Windows PCmakers in January 2014; since then, revenues and per-PC profits have mostly worsened, except for Lenovo and Apple.)It’s actually Dell, which used to break out its enterprise and consumer profitability, which gives us the clue to the problem. Unlike the enterprise market, where manufacturers can often sell direct in huge volumes, the consumer Windows PC market forces manufacturers to sell mostly via retailers.Retailers take a slice of profit; and retail customers love low prices over anything. That, though, erodes profits for the manufacturers. So how do they get them back? Simple – with adware, which is what these Superfish installations were. Superfish intercepted the secure streams going to Google or other search engines and replaced the adverts in them with its own.The reality is that a consumer PC nowadays is a collection of auctionable software elements. The default browser? There’s a price on its head. Antivirus? Those limited trials are worth money to antivirus companies. All those extras help to improve the margins on PCs. It’s not clear how much Superfish helped Lenovo, but it’s remarkable how its PC operating margins improved by two percentage points in a year (it hasn’t released operating margins for any quarter except the end of 2014 and 2013) – helping a per-PC operating profit increase of nearly $11.What drove that? Even with Lenovo’s improving efficiencies, it’s hard not to think that Superfish, and any other preinstalled products, helped, even just a little, by providing a dollar per-install on millions of machines.Adware is big business. Ben Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, has been on the trail of adware companies since 2002, but wasstill finding examples of unwanted installations in January 2014.Superfish is a new name in the field, which until a few days ago might have been best known for its efforts to introduce a “visual search engine” that couldname flowers from a picture, but WindowShopper – the software preinstalled on the Lenovo “consumer laptops” - was first released in 2011. The company said it had 80 million users in mid-2014.Related:Lenovo accused of compromising user security by installing adware on new PCsMight Lenovo not have realised the risks involved in Superfish? Could it have just been someone too eager to close a profitable deal? Not according toa commenter on Hacker News, the watering hole for programmers, who said:Having been privy to OS bundling for products, I can assure you there is lengthy contracts, and negotiations, about exactly what is happening. You do not simply walk up to Lenovo and have your “software” installed into the OS without a very detailed contract and pay structure. There also looks to be Javascript injected into pages, which is serving up the ads, and a comment [in the Javascript] about Lenovo. Think about what that means. There was a project at this company, where they had meetings, project plans, testing to make sure it worked, and a very detailed idea of what was going on. Never mind all the ramping up capacity due to new Lenovo’s boxes coming online. There is zero chance this was some low level junior programmer fly by night operation.So Lenovo knew what it was doing. Whether anyone saw further, to the risks to users of man-in-the-middle attacks (where phishers could for example host a fake Bank of America site yet be told it was authentic), is not.It’s easy for technically competent people to say “Oh, you should wipe the drive and reinstall Windows to avoid all the crapware”, but for the overwhelming majority of people the idea of doing that is too worrying. Which means that they are vulnerable to this sort of backroom deal, accepted with a click of the hundred-page legalese of the end-user licence agreement when the machine first powers up.Related:Lenovo apologises for security-busting adware, offers 'incomplete' removal instructionsThe damage to Lenovo is hard to estimate – but it’s real. The clamour over this mistake (for that’s what Lenovo is effectively admitting it was) will continue for some time. So what advice should you give someone worried that their favourite PC maker has been selling them short? There are three possibilities: buy a“signature edition”via Microsoft, which is guaranteed to be just Windows and nothing else; get a Chromebook; or buy a Macintosh from Apple.Of the three options, the signature edition will at least give the familiar experience of Windows – but Lenovo hasn’t done Microsoft a favour in the past 24 hours or so.
Until recently, if you bought Ubisoft’s historical action adventure Assassin’s Creed: Unity, and came across a blue chest while exploring the game’s luscious depiction of revolutionary France, you wouldn’t have been able to open it. At least you wouldn’t unless you downloaded the special companion app on your Android or Apple phone and synced it to your PC or console.The Assassin’s Creed: Unity app also provides a range of puzzles and a heat map showing how players have competed levels in the main game. But unlike other companion apps recently released for games like Call of Duty, Titanfall and Battlefield, it’s not free. Well, not strictly. Players who download it either have to pay to unlock certain features, or pay for the completely unlocked premium edition. On Wednesday, however, Ubisoftannouncedthat it was unlocking the chests for all gamers. A look at theapp’s Google Play pagetells you part of the reason why: dozens of players complaining that they couldn’t get the app to sync with their console, or who had updated the app only to lose data.This time, the experiment failed for Ubisoft, but we won’t have seen the end of it. Increasingly, major publishers are seeking to extend the revenue possibilities of benchmark releases, way beyond the £45 that players pay for the game itself.Downloadable content (usually shortened to DLC) is the obvious example. Very few major titles these days come without extra features and content that can be downloaded after launch – at a price. First-person shooters such as Battlefield and Call of Duty offer extra multiplayer maps, action adventure titles like Far Cry 4 provide new weapons, role-playing games open up new areas of the open world environment. Players are often given the chance of subscribing to regular DLC drops, or pay a one-off discounted price for a year’s worth of updates.The reasoning is obvious. In 2013, the head of Sony Worldwide Studios, Shuhei Yoshida wasasked by Kotakuwhether the average costs of development on PlayStation 4 would be the same as the last generation’s $20-60m. “Slightly larger,” he responded. Add in the massive costs of TV advertising and other marketing, and companies are now having to sell several million copies of a game just to break even. It’s no wonder they’re looking to maximise revenue from customers who have already bought in to the product.Games as servicesBut of course, “product” is no longer the right word for games. Most publishers now see them as services or platforms, designed to generate revenue across their useful lives. The epic Activision sci-fi shooter Destiny’s expansion packs cost £20 each, adding new quests and raids, and it’s likely future content will be closely designed around how gamers are already interacting with the game. Developer Bungie will be closely monitoring activities, working out what dedicated gamers crave, then offering more of it in subsequent content. It’s all about iteration, refinement and engagement.“Companion apps are part of this service-style supporting of games,” says Steve Bailey, an analyst at IHS Digital. “There are numerous avenues for deepening engagement with a certain segment of the userbase. The format of companion apps varies wildly, too. Where massively multiplayer gamers are concerned, the value they can add is significant and obvious, often representing a great Filofax for content browsing, stat calculators and social arrangements that help keeping the player tethered.”“Tethered” is the perfect word here. As publishers move into a new service economy, retention becomes a key focus – it’s not just about great opening weekend sales, it’s about keeping those customers for 12 months or longer. This may mean “free” companion apps that quietly make the game experience habitual and pervasive, or it may be free DLC that regularly rewards loyalty. Even better, paid DLC can aid retentionandrevenue – it’s a double win.Gamers are so used to this, it’s become part of the fabric of playing, but sometimes publishers stretch the concept to breaking point. When the much-anticipated multiplayer alien hunting game Evolve was launched in early February it offered a $25 DLC season pass complete with an exclusive alien monster and new hunter types, but there was alsoover $60 worth of extra downloadable content, mostly “skins” used to modify the look of characters. Some gamers were furious that only three huntable aliens were included in the main game, with one available only as a monetised extra – effectively 25% of the possible options.“It’s important not to reject non-participants,” says Bailey. “Service-style support of games can ameliorate this, but it’s a balancing act – and an extremely fragile one. When you’ve already asked someone to pay premium ticket for a copy of the game, it’s understandable that they then be cynical about being hassled to make follow-up purchases. A keen sense of loss aversion has been triggered, and understandably so.”The problem with pre-ordersThe cast of the Alien film appears in two bonus missions of the Alien: Isolation game – but originally they were exclusive to pre-order customersPhotograph: SegaWhat gamers are currently most annoyed about, however, is how this process is being moved further forward in the pipeline between pre-release hype and after-sales monetisation. Many titles are now being advertised with exclusive content that can only be unlocked if the game is pre-ordered. The most high-profile example has been Sega’s critically acclaimed Alien: Isolation which initially offered two special missions featuring the cast of the original Alien movie – but only as an extra for pre-order customers. Sega later made both missions available to all in a post-release DLC package, but Alien fans were annoyed that before release they were effectively being coerced into laying down money.Again, the economics make perfect sense. For retailers it’s about working out how much stock they should order in, but for publishers it’s about convincing retailers to order in as much as possible. And in the increasingly complex games retail market, where high street stores have to battle with supermarkets and online retailers, exclusive pre-order bonuses are a way to tempt customers back into shops. For the UK release of Nintendo’s fantasy battle Hyrule Warriors for example, Amazon got an exclusive Skyward Sword costume set while Game offered a Twilight Princess alternative. In this way, publishers ensure a variety of stockists are buying in more enthusiastically, while also encouraging fans to commit their money sooner.However, increasingly, committed game buyers are becoming tired of being used as pawns in the stocking manouveres of huge companies. So many modern titles have collectibles built into the design mechanic; worlds are now filled with trinkets to pick up. Discovering and completing these collections has become a heady compulsion loop – like football sticker albums, it feeds into that completist instinct. But when those loops seem to be exploited by hiding loot within pre-order bonuses, DLC or companion apps it feels ... wrong. The biggest challenge publishers face over the next five years is creating games that work as services without alienating the very enthusiasts they desperately need to secure and monetise.“Pre-order bonuses, companion apps, DLC – all these things can and have worked, but the value proposition needs to be handled deftly, or else all they’ll do is generate more pain points,” says Bailey. “We’ve spent much of the past generation of console gaming exploring this. The industry is still iterating and refining, and gamers are voicing their concerns, and we need both of these things for a healthy push-pull to help the ideas take shape – even if publishers sometimes seem cynical in their actions, or gamers sometimes seem overbearing in their response, when regarded in isolation.“The games landscape has become incredibly complex, and if dedicated consoles are to persist, they have to explore the opportunities presented by connectivity, the service ideal and new business models, and so on. But the difference between actual and perceived value wrung from video games has always been in turmoil.”
When the UK police arrested an 18-year-old man over the online attack in December that knocked both the XBox Live and PlayStation Network offline, plenty of people raised knowing eyebrows. On Twitter, the chatter was that the person arrested was someone known as “Jordie”, whose profile picture – and occasional tweets - suggests a black teenager from Rio de Janiero’s favelas, rather than the resident of Southport that the arrest (and his other tweets) reveals him to be.Among those who follow hacker culture, the arrest had only been a matter of time. Those observers see it as inevitable that Lizard Squad will follow what is now a standard narrative arc: burst to prominence, hack something, hack something bigger, until someone makes a mistake that leads to one or more members being arrested. Court cases will follow, the gang will break up, and the members will quietly fade from view with only their search history linking them to what happened.Examples going back through three decades of hacking show this arc repeated again and again. Kevin Mitnick became famous in the 1990s for stealing the source code for various computer systems; he went on the run, and then was caught, and served time in jail. Now he’s a successful security consultant.In 1994, a group of people, mostly in their twenties, wereindictedfor stealing credit card numbers. Now they’re living apparently regular, suburban lives.In 1995 I met a hacker calling himself “Coldfire”, who explained to me howsome business phone exchanges could be used to make cheap calls internationally. From time to time Coldfire (I never knew his real name, though we met in person) got in touch. Then he told me he’d been arrested and bailed. Then, nothing.Fast forward about 20 years, and LulzSec coalesced out of Anonymous, hacked some games sites, hacked some bigger sites – including the Serious Organised Crime Agency – and then were arrested. After what seemed an age for the legal process, some served sentences; now they’re getting on with life outside hacking. Two British ex-LulzSec members, Jake “Topiary” Davis and Mustafa “Tflow” al-Bassam, are quietly engaged with legitimate work – or in al-Bassam’s case, university studies. (Both declined to be interviewed.)Ex-Lulzsec member Jake Davis was sentenced to three years in jail.Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PA“LizardSquad reminds me of LulzSec,” says Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, who has watched malware wash back and forth across the internet for years, and hacker groups rise and fall. “High-profile antics, surprisingly effective attacks, and shortlived – which LizardSquad will be, no doubt.”Related:Lizard Squad is back: group 'attacks Xbox Live and Daybreak Games'There’s nothing to suggest Lizard Squad is any different from scores of hacker groups that have preceded it. So if its demise is certain (even if the timing isn’t), what is different about hacker culture now – and how is it changing?InceptionEvery hacking crew starts through people meeting; in the 1970s through to the rise of the internet in the 1990s, it used to be through physical acquaintance. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak used to be “phone phreaks”, who would use “blue boxes” to make long-distance (often prank) calls for free. By the 1990s, groups such as 2600 (its name refers to a blue box frequency) held meetings in cities; Coldfire told me he first learnt about phone hacking through a 2600 city meet. But the rise of the internet over the past 20 years means that would-be hackers don’t have to physically meet up; they can get in touch over the net.What’s more, the sources of inspiration to become a hacker has changed, explains Gabriella Coleman, a media studies professor (and trained anthropologist) at McGill University in Montreal. Coleman has spent years documenting the hacker culture, and written a book “Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: the many faces of Anonymous” which delves into the underground world of the hacking collective.What most people call “hacking”, she more carefully defines as “transgressive hacking”, emphasising the idea that it violates our norms of ownership and control. She has studied hacking culture – which in her definition includes the creation of open-source tools and messing around with code for political ends – for around 15 years. “I’ve spoken to hackers who first sawWar Games[from 1983] as a kid and asked for a modem for a Christmas present. The difference now is that these are actual hacker groups on Twitter and so on, rather than a representation. But just like with films and articles, this is a way more hackers are produced. While more elite hackers may frown upon [Lizard Squad] as ”skiddies” [”script kiddies”, who use others’ instructions to carry out hacks], even so young people are interested in it,” she told me.“What has been interesting to track is the diversification of communities that have sprung up around the moniker ‘hacker’: open source, crypto, gray hat, hacktivism, security hackers, subversive hacking, black hat criminal hacking,” she says. Some old-school hackers are almost appalled at the idea of using Twitter; in the past, it was an underground activity, and treated like Fight Club: the first rule was you didn’t talk about it.“The rise of activist groups and then hacker crews like A-Team, Panthers, Lulzsec, Antisec, and Lizard Squad have undoubtedly brought the idea/ethos/style of hacking to larger swathes of the population, and it does make it attractive,” Coleman says.Some criminal hacking is never visible to the ordinary public, such as theft of source code for games and apps from corporate systems in order to sell them on black markets. Credit card fraud, known as “carding”, is commonplace too. Only when those involved come to court do we hear about them. By contrast the activities of younger hackers tend to be far more visible. And that’s often how they want it.Related:Hackers steal $1bn  in series of online bank thefts says report“Now what is different is that anyone can interact with hackers via Twitter, and this is a big change from the past, where you had to have a bit more skill to find them,” says Coleman, who says she hadn’t grasped the significance of social media previously.‘It has never been easier to start hacking’How does a hacking crew form? Brian Krebs, a former Washington Post reporter who now works as a security researcher and journalist, and has infiltrated a number of underground carding forums as well as broken stories about serious hacks of US retailers, suggests that hacking is not just more visible.“It’s never been easier for people who know next to nothing about hacking and attacking others online to get started and to appear far more skilled than they are; the widespread availability of point-and-click hacking tools dramatically lowers the barriers of entry to many types of cybercrime, from hacking websites and databases to creating botnets and launching massively disruptive denial-of-service attacks,” he says.“Worse yet, for those novices who can’t be bothered to learn how to use these beginner-friendly point-and-click tools, there is a robust community on underground forums that will help you set all of it up, albeit for a fee.”But there’s one way in which what Coleman calls “transgressive hackers” – and hacking crews – differ from other hacking areas, and the rest of life: the absence of women. “When giving talks about Anonymous, I often remind my audience that while there are women participants, some of them geeky and technical, when it came to the hacker crews they were composed exclusively of men. The audience gasps. Then I remind them that this is not unique to Anonymous but mirrors the transgressive hacker tradition since its inception in phreaking,” she says.The hacker collectiveAnonymous claimedto have taken control of almost 100 Twitter accounts associated with Isis in an operation begun in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attacks.Photograph: Action Press / Rex Features/Action Press / Rex Features“In 15 years I have never met a black hat female with the exception of two who are transgender.”Related:'Revenge porn king' Hunter Moore pleads guilty to hacking chargesDowntime and neecessary enemiesGetting everything in place for a hacking attack takes time; even once a target has been identified and chosen, it is like an assault on a castle, where a frontal assault is unlikely to yield any benefit.In the case of theattack on the Malaysia Airlines websitein January, Lizard Squad appears not to have broken into the site itself – but instead used a DNS redirect, hacking the system that would route a request to go tomalaysiaairlines.comto a different site they had set up. Anyone who entered login details to the fake site had effectively given them to the hackers, who could then log in to the real site and gather users’ details from there. If any of those who logged in had elevated privileges on the site, the effect could be disastrous.Such DNS hacking resembles phishing; but it’s a matter of debate among hackers whether using it demonstrates skill or not. Some DNS hacks involve “social engineering” – fooling an administrator with a fake email to change a setting – while others might require sophisticated hacking that usurps a machine. It’s not known which method Lizard Squad employed.But whereas before Twitter it was possible to just go quiet and then come back, these days everything is public, says Coleman. “A lot of these activities online have been like a tournament of sorts,” she says. “Hackers have always tried to outdo each other, but now the game has been ratcheted up. Now it’s about media attention. ” However, as she points out, “the more public you are, the more likely to get caught”.Now, though, every group has to outdo what has gone before; and each exploit by a group has to outdo what it did before. For Lizard Squad, hacking Malaysia Airlines wasn’t quite enough, so it claimed to be affiliated with Islamic State, just to add an extra element of outrage. So what can the group do next?The downtime involved in such preparations, while the group isn’t – to the public eye – doing anything carries its own risks: principally, that the group will fade from notice, perhaps to be replaced by some other upstart.What to do? Usually they pick on someone to hate, because it annoys that person, and provides a visible diversion, while not requiring any actual hacking. “These kids are so desperate for attention and validation that many of them will stop at nothing to get it,” comments Krebs. “Everyone loves drama, and these kids are good at churning it up.”Krebs himself has been the repeated target of such attention, from Lizard Squad and others: in one case, a “carder” called Krebs’s local police station and pretended to be calling from his house, claiming there had been a kidnapping at gunpoint. The intention was to get armed police sent to the house. In Krebs’s case it didn’t work: there’s a warning with his local police about calls appearing to come from his house. Lizard Squad has vaguely threatened Krebs, and lampooned him with pictures. He laughs it off, and suggests the clock is ticking for them.In the case of LulzSec, their nemesis was a rival hacker called The Jester, who claims to have a military background (and certainly has sympathies with the US military) and who had previously been notable forapparently knocking WikiLeaks offline with a DDOS attack in November 2010, when it was releasing the US diplomatic cables in conjunction with a number of papers, including the Guardian. The Jester, too, liked to suggest that time was running out for LulzSec, because it is a threat that is hardly ever wrong.Hector Xavier Monsegur, AKA Sabu, a skilled technician who turned from having been a leading figure of the Anonymous and LulzSec collectives into what was in effect an undercover FBI agent.Photograph: Public domainHaving an enemy seems to provide a focus for a group that also stops people worrying. Because the signs are that when hackers are considering another exploit, they are also nervous. That emerges from theLulzSec chat transcripts, and indeed any transcript of hacking crews: there’s lots of paranoia, and discussion of whether people have been “v&amp;’d” – vanned (put into a police van) – or might themselves be hacked, or impostors, or subverted. Even before Hector Monsegur, aka LulzSec’s“Sabu”, was revealedto have worked for the FBI,about one in four hackers was reckoned to be an FBI informant. So nobody can entirely trust anyone, creating an atmosphere where the members of a crew are constantly second-guessing each others’ motives, wondering if the next suggested hack is actually the path to betrayal.The mistakeEveryone makes mistakes; it’s part of life. And mistakes are what lead hackers to be caught. Mitnickused programs he had stolen, which led their creator to him. Monsegur was tracked by the FBI after he logged on to a chat server directly from his laptop, instead of via the multiple proxy servers he had been using.Sometimes the errors lie in the past: Monsegur had already been identified, though not for certain, by rival hackers who had combed the internet to find his previous postings (unearthing his past hacktivism for Puerto Rico, and his New York location, and even photos). Someone in Lizard Squad might already have made the mistake that leads back to them. “It’s more fun to do hacking as a crew; you form bonds of fellowship. It’s much tougher to work with people for a month and then vanish,” says Coleman. “That goes against our natural inclination to form social ties. And that puts you in danger; the slipups in LulzSec were social as well as technical.”Yet a disastrous mistake is not absolutely inevitable, she says. “For those in the US or UK, from the little I have learned on the topic, if you work alone and are really good about opsec [operational security] and go about your business quietly, you can dabble in criminal rings without much risk.”She points to the hacking last year of Gamma International, which sells the FinnFisher surveillance software to governments and companies: “that hacker did it for political purposes. They linked to the source code on Reddit, and released a document about how to cover your tracks online. And then just vanished.”She thinks we will see more of such one-off hacks, where people “smarten up” about the risks of continuing a campaign under a single banner.The sentencingSentencing for hacking offences varies widely by country and by age of participant. Usually, those who are under 18 (“minors”, in the judicial sense) at the time of the offence will not get a custodial sentence. For those over that age, jail terms can run into decades, even where it looks unreasonable to onlookers.It’s quite possible that a number of Lizard Squad’s members are under 18, and that creates its own problems, suggests Krebs. “I think they cynically (and sadly, correctly) understand that if law enforcement comes for them, it will take months, and they can have one hell of a long joyride in the process. It seems that many of them really do believe that the e-fame they get for their antics could help them get a job one day, so it’s a win-win for them.“I think most of the kids doing this activity are probably technically (if not clinically) sociopaths who derive pleasure out of the hurting or misfortune of others. Somehow, we need to dramatically shorten the window of time from when this activity starts to when the intervention (either by parents, school, law enforcement or all of the above) happens.”The aftermathWhat happens once a crew has been broken up, or fizzled out, or just vanishes? Some give up because the police are on their case; others simply go deeper and wind up in the criminal underground, hacking for money. “Given enough time and left to their own devices, the skiddies will get better, and more involved in serious cybercrime, including extortion and sextortion, credit card theft, money laundering and DDoS attacks,” says Krebs.Hypponen thinks that the aftermath for some is not to be caught, but instead to “go dark” and move into potentially lucrative criminal hacking. “I’m quite certain that one of the reasons teenage hackers with high-profile media personalities ‘disappear’ is that they realise they can actually make money with their skills and go dark,” he told me.Since I spoke to Hypponen, Lizard Squad has indeed “gone dark” – apparently because both its Twitter account and website were hacked: after claiming to hack Taylor Swift’s Twitter and Instagram accounts, the group’s own @lizardmafia account was hacked, as was its lizardsquad.com domain, apparently by a group calling itselfAnonymous Protectionwhich describes itself as “a subsidiary of Anonymous dedicated to protect the people of the internet” and based in the UK. At which point one could enter into bluff and double-bluff: what if Lizard Squad somehow handed over their details so they could disappear? Or if they’re actually the ones behind it? This is the problem one faces in investigating and writing about hacking: hardly anything is certain, until it ends up in court.But there are multiple paths. “There is also a countervailing tendency that I have seen whereby hackers who start hacking into websites for fun are lured into activism thanks to the prominence of groups like WikiLeaks and Anonymous,” says Coleman. Al-Bassam told me last year that he was interested in helping enable access to the internet in countries where it’s restricted.Yet there are other paths – neither through the courts or into the criminal side. When LulzSec was in the ascendant, one of its biggest antagonists was “Team Pois0n”. A British teenager who was one of its membersheaded to Syria while on police bail, having already served six months in prison for hacking and ID theft, and isnow reckoned to be behind Islamic State’s (Isis) hacking attacks on the west, such as its takeover of US Central Command’s Twitter and YouTube accounts. “There’s someone behind that stuff who clearly knows what they’re doing,” one observer of the hacking world told me.Quite how long his hacking lifespan – or actual lifespan – might be expected to be with Isis is unknown. But the idea that someone could effectively be employed by a radical Islamic group with medieval leanings to organise its social media presence and hack for it would have belonged in science fiction even five years ago.Given the arc so many stories follow, do hackers have a shorter lifespan now? Coleman doesn’t think so. “Older hackers in their thirties and forties, they are very smart and can cover their tracks.”One of the most iconic hackers,John Draper, aka “Captain Crunch”, is now in his seventies, having hacked into phone systems, served prison terms and written widely used software.Maybe the Lizard Squad members will join him in that longevity. But first they have to play out the rest of their story.
Payment processor Stripe has launched support for bitcoin, a year after announcing its plans to incorporate the cryptocurrency into its service.A Silicon Valley darling, Stripe allows businesses to incorporate payment services into apps and websites with just a few lines of code. Its co-founder describes it as “a programming language for payments”, and it is popular for the ease with which it can be integrated into software.The bitcoin functionality allows companies which already use Stripe to take card payments to also begin accepting the cryptocurrency. It lets businesses receive the money in conventional currencies, minus a transaction fee, and keeps the prices constant across exchange rate fluctuations.The companypoints outto businesses that there are upsides and downsides to taking bitcoin. “With credit cards, you collect a card number from your user. You can use this card number multiple times, but each time, the user’s bank may choose to decline the charge. Simply collecting the card number does not guarantee access to any particular amount of funds.However, it explains, “with Bitcoin, there’s no saved number that you can attempt to charge multiple times or at a later date. Instead, you invert the process by telling your customer how much they need to pay you, and providing a way for them to be able to pay you that amount—a place where they can ‘push’ funds.”Bitcoin futureBut since Stripe announced an intention to take the cryptocurrency, the market has changed drastically. The price of bitcoin has plummeted from $667 a coin to just under $250, even as the number of potential use cases has expanded: on Thursday, Dell announced it would be taking the cryptocurrency in the UK following a successful trial in the US.Dell’s launch was enabled by Coinbase, the market leader for bitcoin financial services, which said that the computer manufacturer “is now the largest merchant to accept bitcoin internationally, paving the way for retailers around the world to follow suit.“It’s another big step towards expanding bitcoin acceptance worldwide and something we’re excited to be a part of,” said Fred Ehrsam, co-Founder at Coinbase.
Lenovo, the world’s largest PC manufacturer, has apologised for installing malware on consumer laptops, and attempted to issue instructions on how to fix a flaw that fatally compromised user security.The company was forced to issue a second set of instructions after security experts said that following its first set would do nothing to patch up the security holes the adware a created. But even the second set is “incomplete”, according to researchers, and leaves users of the popular Firefox browser vulnerable.Lenovo said that between September and December last year itsconsumer laptops were shipped with an adware programme called Superfish. But rather than apologise, the company initially said that the software was included in the laptops “to enhance the experience for users”.Hours later, the company altered its statement to remove that claim, and to “apologize for causing any concern to any users for any reason”. The software bombarded affected users with pop-up adverts and injected more ads into Google searches. Security experts say it also left a gaping security hole on every computer, in the form of a self-signed root certificate.That certificate was used by the software to inject adverts even into encrypted websites, but its presence has the side-effect of making affected Lenovo computers trivially easy to hack with a “man in the middle” (MITM) attack, in which a hacker uses the certificate to pretend to be a trusted website, such as a bank or e-commerce site. The “man in the middle” can then steal information passed over the internet, even while the user believes they are safely browsing with encryption turned on.Initially,Lenovo offered users removal instructions for the Superfish software, telling them to remove it using Windows’ own uninstall feature.But the company followed the advice with an odd admission: “Superfish will be removed from Program Files and Program Data directories, files in user directory will stay intact for the privacy reason. Registry entry and root certificate will remain as well.”Lenovo’s initial statement did not detail what “the privacy reason” was, and the company did not reply to requests for clarification.Instead, it updated its statement to link tomore complete removal instructions. But the instructions still fail to remove the bad certificate from the Firefox browser, if a user has that installed. Coder Filippo Valsorda, who createdthe Badfish toolfor determining if a computer is affected by the software,has offered instructions for how to remove it from that browser as well.‘Thoroughly investigated’Despite admitting that the Superfish software installs a root certificate on affected computers, and that a simple uninstall will not remove the root certificate, Lenovo’s statement initially said that “we have thoroughly investigated this technology and do not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns”. The company did not respond to a request for clarification, but again updated the statement hours later to link toa security advisorywarning users of a highly severe vulnerability.Superfish, the company which makes the software, continues to insist that “at no time were consumers vulnerable”,according to the Wall Street Journal.The company has not responded to the Guardian’s request for comment.While Lenovo initally said it did not believe there is evidence to “substantiate” security concerns, independent researchers disagreed.The Electronic Frontier Foundation said: “Lenovo has not just injected ads in a wildly inappropriate manner, but engineered a massive security catastrophe for its users. The use of a single certificate for all of the MITM attacks means thatallHTTPS security for at least Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Safari for Windows, onallof these Lenovo laptops, is now broken.” It points out that the information required to perform such an attackhas already been extracted from an infected machine.Wim Remes of security firm Rapid7 says: “That a big vendor like Lenovo lends itself to this kind of practice is a big disappointment.

Apple is reported to be working on an electric car or vehicle-related project that could be released by 2020.The Cupertino, California-based company has been on a hiring spree attracting key members of rival car manufacturers’ electric and new vehicle system teams.A report by technology site9to5Mac detailsmore than 18 people hired with specialisms in car safety, renewable energy, battery and hybrid technology and car software systems.A new team hasreportedly been set upat Apple under the control of the former Ford executive Steve Zadesky and former chief executive of Mercedes-Benz’s research and development Johann Jungwirth.The majority of the new Apple employees come from Ford, Tesla and battery technology company A123 Systems,which this month sued Apple for poaching its top engineers. A123 System’s lawsuit alleges Apple began an “aggressive campaign” to poach engineers not just from A123, but also from other battery manufacturers including LG Chem, Samsung, Panasonic, Toshiba and Johnson Controls.Areport from Bloombergindicates that Apple is targeting an electric car for release as early as 2020. Vehicles typically take seven years to develop.Most manufacturers base new models on common structures and components shared with other vehicles in their ranges to reduce cost and development time, meaning vehicles that look very different on the outside could be very similar on the inside. Apple will not have that immediate luxury unless the company partners with another manufacturer.Apple declined to comment.Related:Tesla Model-S launch: an electric car to answer even Clarkson's objectionsElon Musk’s Tesla has shown that electric vehicles are viable for a business with its Roadster andthen Model S, which recently gained a fasterdual-motor versionwith an “insane mode” which reaches 60 miles per hour in under 3.2 seconds.The electric car company is planning to release a new Model 3, which will cost under $35,000 in the US with a range of at least 200 miles per charge. Tesla’s larger Model S has a range of over 300 miles.Musk has stated that Apple has been attempting to hire Tesla employees offering them $250,000 signing bonuses and 60% salary increases.AWall Street Journal reportindicated that Apple was working on a minivan-like vehicle codenamed “Titan”. A minivan leased to Apple modified with cameras and sensors required for mapping technologies similar to Google’s Street View, as well as self-driving cars, was spotteddriving around New York and the San Francisco Bay area.Apple is under increasing scrutiny for further breakthrough products following is success with the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Apple’s smartwatch is expected to be the next big thing for the company when it launches in April, but within five years the pressure could be back on for another hit.The electric car industry is currently in a similar state to the smartphone industry before Apple’s introduction of the first iPhone in 2007. Apple has a history of success launching products that although aren’t the first on the market, concentrate on a clearly defined and heavily controlled user experience.Related:10 reasons to hope Apple isn't really making a carWhether the company is capable of doing the same thing for the electric car, solving key pain points around current implementations including range and charging times, is less clear.Tesla and Musk are working on precisely that type of market disruption, and have been since 2003. The company has had success with the current Model S, which has seen improvements rolled out with software updates since its launch, adding miles to its range and new user-requested features – a first for the car industry.Should Apple proceed with delivery of an electric car, it will require large scale investment, not only in engineering talent and development, but in manufacturing technology, distribution and support infrastructure on a grander scale than its current network of Apple stores deliver.
Lee is a lifelong gamer; he also has spinal muscular atrophy, a disease that causes progressive muscle weakness. When his condition meant that he was no longer physically able to play games, he became depressed – he felt like part of who he was had slipped away. Now, with a combination of a mouth-controlled joystick and a series of micro-switches he is playing again. He has just completed Grand Theft Auto V. “There are no more limitations,” he says.The staff atSpecialEffecthave dozens of stories like this. Set up in 2007 by Dr Mick Donegan, a specialist in assistive technology, the charity uses a range of specialist interfaces to help people with disabilities who want to play video games but can’t use standard controllers. They have palm and chin joysticks, they have button pads that can be pressed with feet, and voice control systems. Some setups implement technologies developed by other organisations, some are custom built by resident engineer Barrie Ellis and his small in-house team, who’ll often happily rip apart standard peripherals before reconfiguring them into more accessible gadgets.“Sometimes part of the interface is PC-based in order to run software to change how the joysticks or buttons behave,” explains SpecialEffect communications officer, Mark Saville. “For instance, we’ll remap buttons or change the joystick sensitivity. For other controllers, we use software to incorporate inputs such as voice control. If something doesn’t exist or is prohibitively expensive, we make modifications to hardware ourselves.“Our job is to join the dots by connecting a person’s abilities with the tech, often in combinations – voice commands, muscle twitch switches and eye control, for example.”One of the specialist controllers used by SpecialEffect to help people with disabilities to get back into games.Photograph: SpecialEffectFrom vending machines to monstersOne recent collaboration is particularly interesting. Working with confectionary company Mondelez International, SpecialEffect combined the PC life simulation game Spore, with an eye-tracking system and a 3D printer. Players with severe physical disabilities are able to design monsters in the game using their eye movements to control the cursor, then have their creations printed out as models. Mondelez usually uses its 3D printing tech to prototype vending machines. Now it helps people build monsters.From modest beginnings, the charity has garnered huge support within the industry, recently announcing Tim Schafer the co-creator of the legendary Monkey Island games as a vice-president, along with Labour MP Tom Watson and BBC technology reporter Kate Russell. With greater visibility comes greater demand. “It’s been a crazy year for us,” says Saville. “The number of people contacting us for help and support has shot up as word has spread. With gamers increasingly moving to the next-gen consoles over the last year this has also added to the demand for our work and created some interesting tech problems. Finding solutions has been challenging, but it has had a huge impact on those we work with.”What’s being recognised at the heart of this is the fundamental importance of play – and the joy of video games. In a video interview SpecialEffect posted on YouTube, Lee talks about the loss of identity he suffered when he could no longer play games; it’s not just about losing out on fun, it’s about relationships. Lee can now play Fifa 15 with his brother, even though they won’t be able to have a real-life kickabout together. Games can help rebuild sections of relationships that some of us take for granted. In another video we see a girl named Ceyda, who has cerebral palsy, playing the action adventure game Disney Infinity.Her delight is palpable. “It’s something she can play with her friends and not be excluded,” explains her mum. “Her first words were: ‘I’m now a gamer’”.Matching players with game systems is a complex undertaking. Donegan often talks about how every person the charity sees is effectively a separate project: everybody has different needs and abilities that the modified hardware has to fit in with. “We have a games room at our Oxfordshire HQ,” says Saville. “People can visit to try out controllers with friends and family in a relaxed setting with our staff, who are specialists in getting the most out of the technology. But most people we see are unable to travel, so we visit them at their homes, sometimes multiple times.”With degenerative conditions, the controllers often need to be modified or rethought as the condition progresses. The charity also has occupational therapists who work with gamers, testing their abilities and ensuring comfort. “They’re also brilliant at coming up with great low-tech [controller] solutions,” says Saville. “I took a look in one of their kit bags the other day and saw an assortment of weird stuff including garden twine, table tennis balls, Blu-Tack and, rather disconcertingly, a tube of tile grout. I’m assured it’s all useful.”Gamers are able to borrow expensive specialist hardware like an IntegraMouse or Eye Gaze eye-tracking camera, have it set up and ensure it works for them before they purchase their own hardware. “It’s a genuine privilege to be able to witness the moment that it all clicks into place,” says Saville. “The smiles, the laughs – it makes it all worthwhile.”The Gameblast weekendThis weekend, the charity is running its biggest fundraising event yet:GameBlast, a sponsored 48-hour gaming marathon with people all over the country streaming footage of themselves playing games for the entire weekend. SpecialEffect is also hosting its owntelethon on the online channel Twitch, where viewers will be able to see game developers playing and chatting about their latest projects.GameBlastLive is being shown via Twitch, from 10am on Saturday.Often when games are written about in relation to life or culture, there will be a smattering of comments about how they’re a waste of time, how there are so many better things to do. But SpecialEffect’s work illustrates rather profoundly how games can facilitate social contact and creativity; they provide a ‘magic circle’ in which physical limitations can be cast away in the pursuit of fun.After the hectic GameBlast weekend, work will return to normal for SpecialEffect, matching gamers with the equipment they need, exploring new control options. Technology continually evolves to allow fresh possibilities. “We’ve even been looking into brain control as a future option,” says Saville. “We’re following developments closely.”GameBlastis taking place this weekend. TheGameBlastLive broadcastbegins on Saturday at 10am.
I’ve been recommending the use of open file formats for decades, and in 2003 my Guardian column included the original formulation ofSchofield’s First Law of Computing, which says: Never put data into a program unless you can see exactly how to get it out. So while I don’t disagree with Henry Law (The right format for preserving our data,Letters, February 18), the reality is more complex. There are some proprietary formats I don’t mind using, including RTF (Rich Text Format), developed by Microsoft, and the WAV audio format, developed by Microsoft and IBM for Windows 3, and Adobe’s PDF (now open) and PSD. As for Microsoft Office, Law should note that it supports ODF formats, and that its default format since 2007 has been Office Open XML. This was standardised as ECMA-376 in 2006 and, in later versions, as ISO/IEC 29500 in 2008. In fact, Microsoft started supporting XML formats in Office in 2002-03, whereas the first official meeting about the XML-based ODF wasn’t held until 16 December 2002. Either way, billions of Microsoft Office documents make this overwhelmingly the de facto standard, and de facto standards could turn out to be more future-proof than de jure standards that have relatively little support.Jack SchofieldLondon
Google has acknowledged it needs to “try and see things from a more European perspective” as it acknowledges criticism over its handling of the “right to be forgotten” case.Now known as ”the right to delist”, the case saw Google lose to a Spanish lawyer who objected to out-of-date and potentially harmful information about him appearing high up on Google’s search results for his name. The European Court of Justice found in favour of the lawyer, Mario Costeja Gonzalez, in May 2014.Google now acknowledges that the reaction to the ruling – Google has received 220,000 requests to remove information – showed significant, pent-up demand from citizens requesting the removal of outdated, inaccurate or irrelevant search results on their name.“Google has been working hard to strike the right balance,” said Peter Barron, Google’s European communications director, speaking at a debate in London on 17 February where he said Google would not speak against the right to be delisted. “We certainly accept that there is an issue to be addressed. For us, the whole process has been an exercise in learning and listening and, as Larry Page has said, to try to see things from a more European perspective.”“Many of the requests we’ve had so far are straightforward – a clear cut accept or reject – while others raise complex legal and ethical questions,” he added. In the more complex cases, Google is now expected to exercise “judgment calls” that it “never expected or wanted to make,” he said, describing “complicated decisions that would in the past have been extensively examined in the courts, now being made by scores of lawyers and paralegal assistants”.Related:How Google determined our right to be forgottenUsing examples of straightforward decisions in Google’s Transparency Report, Barron said the search engine had removed a link to an old newspaper article about a rape which was prominent in results for the victim’s name, but refused a request to remove a link to a story about a financial crime for a professional. Some are harder to judge, such as spent convictions, comments the author later wanted to retract, or “an interview freely given about sexual proclivities, that the interviewee now wishes he hadn’t taken part in. (The interview, that is, not the proclivities.)”“Many predicted at the outset that Google would simply agree to most requests for removal to save time and money,” said Barron. “That hasn’t happened – 60% of removal requests have been rejected. Every single request is considered by our teams and there is no automation. If their judgment is challenged by the publisher we will reconsider and, if a mistake has been made, we will reinstate.”Barron said that Google internal procedures were close to the guidance issued by European regulators in November. Google is considering the recent report compiled by members of its independent advisory council who, Barron said, “were free to reach a consensus or to dissent from the consensus view – and they did.”Geoffrey Robertson QC, speaking alongside Barron, highlighted concerns about the “dramatic new challenges to privacy posed by the megamoguls of the worldwide web”.“The internet is our main vehicle for self-expression and friendship formation. Unless it is regulated by the accepted data protection principles, its users will suffer outrageous invasion of their privacy or will have to censor themselves – and both these outcomes are undesirable in a society committed to human flourishing.”Legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg, also debating, described the ECJ ruling as striking a fair balance. “The right to be forgotten is not a super-right that trumps freedom of expression. The case doesn’t mean that news organisations can’t write about people. It doesn’t mean they have to delete stories they have written already,” he said.“That’s the spirit of the revised EU data protection regulation: empowering individuals to manage their personal data while explicitly protecting freedom of expression and the media.”During the debate former GCHQ director Sir David Omand disagreed with Robertson arguing that the right to delist was “law by slogan” and a nonsense. In the Internet of Everything, he said, data from the mobile devices we carry, the apps we use, and the sensors we wear, is all accessible. “Our very presence in the world has changed this digital totality and we cannot have the right to rewrite history to erase those traces.”
Watching the career of Sonic the Hedgehog is like following a once beloved actor on a nightmarish hellbound career trajectory, from Oscar success, through supporting roles in increasingly dire movies, to a life spent attending fan conventions in small cold towns, grimly signing photos for a dwindling crowd of nostalgic weirdos. I’m speaking as a Sonic fan here.Yes, I’m one of those weirdos. I’m cool with that – or at least Iwasuntil I played last year’s Sonic Boom, the gaming equivalent of your favourite actor suddenly turning up in a British movie farce that also stars Kelly Brook and Christopher Biggins. Sonic Boom is so bad, I almost cried with frustration and horror during the E3 demo. The Sega staff member exhibiting the game looked actively concerned as, directly in front of him, a middle-aged journalist slumped forward head-in-hands, dry-sobbing like a child.So I stayed away when, in early February, Sega teased details of the hedgehog’s next game. Named Sonic Runners, it’s a smartphone platformer in the traditional 2D visual style, with early screenshots resembling the Casino Street stage from Sonic 4. According to an article in Japanese magazine Famitsu,translated by Polygon, it’s an “endless runner”, like Canabalt and Temple Run, which means that Sonic moves automatically, you just touch the screen to jump. It’s being developed by Sonic Team in Japan, who, of course, created the earliest and best Sonic titles – though none of the original creative masterminds (Yuji Naka, Naoto Ohshima and Hirokazu Yasuhara) remain.Now there is footage. You’ve probably already watched it. If not, watch the video now.It looks ... okay? I don’t know. It’s clearly harking back to the original three games (you can unlock Tails and Knuckles apparently); there are loops and golden rings and jump pads. The parallax scrolling is super nice.And, um, endless runners are fun, right? Sega has already discovered this with its presentable into-the-screen take on the genre, Sonic Dash. Rayman Jungle Run was also really good. And look, Sonic himself is back to a more familiar design after that wholedisastrous Boom makeover; most vitally, he’s got rid of all that athletic tape he wound around his feet in a strange and unexpected tribute to the ancient Chinese practice of foot-binding.Sonic is free againOh yes, it’s free-to-play. This was always going to happen, so let’s try not to whine about it. It’s free-to-play and it looks like there will be microtransactions. Theteaser sitementions 20 collectible “companions” who provide Sonic with assistance: a radio-controlled balloon ensures he always makes jump pads successfully while a golden pig collects any rings dropped when enemies are touched. There are also collectible items that give special abilities. Doubtless, some of these will be monetised, like the power-ups in Candy Crush Saga.Free-to-play isn’t intrinsically evil (shock, horror), but it does alter the design sensibilities of the project; ithasto because the developer needs to ensure players are incentivised to make purchases. Are all these collectibles going to enhance the gameplay experience or are they going to get in its way, like all the many extra moves added to Sonic’s repertoire since the spin dash? Are they just there to pad out the paid-for customisation potential?However you feel about it, this is probably the future for old Sonic. Sega has just gone througha painful restructuring, looking to shed 300 staff through voluntary and enforced redundancies, and refocusing on PC and smartphone titles. Consequently, the company has been investing heavily in small smartphone-focused studios,most recently buying Demiurge, the team behind hit iPhone game Marvel Puzzle Quest. Sega has also done well with mobile versions of classic titles such as Crazy Taxi and Super Monkey Ball, capitalising on both the ubiquity of smartphones and the nostalgia of older fans who probably wouldn’t buy a remastered version of an old Dreamcast game on PlayStation 4, but may be tempted on iPhone or Android. If it’s free.That’s the market Sonic is in these days. He’s a quick hit of old-school fun. That’s what we have to come to terms with. I once posited that the future could be saved by handing over the character to the indie community and letting, say, the Super Meat Boy creators have a bash at him. Right now, a duo of fans is looking to complete its own update of Sonic 3 for smartphones, and there’s evena petition to Segato help them complete it. But the coder hasblogged abouthow all his Sega contacts have left, taking him back to square one.Meanwhile, over in Nintendo land, Sonic’s once rival Mario is still at the top of his Hollywood “A” game, in terms of quality if not sales (the Wii U is still underperforming, despite hosting the brilliant Super Mario 3D World and Mario Kart 8). Unlike Sega, Nintendo has remained suspicious of the smartphone market, though it is now tentatively exploring free-to-play, most recently via Pokemon Shuffle. However, I can’t imagine Mario ever going through the motions on a phone screen, trying to seduce players into paying a little extra for a mushroom or a double jump, or a golden tanooki suit.Related:Peter Molyneux interview: 'It's over, I will not speak to the press again'But Sonic’s trajectory is so different to Mario’s. He’s got to graft now, he’s got to muscle in amongst the app store hoi polloi. Sonic Boom ensured that most people aren’t going to pay for Sonic games anymore. He has to monetise our memories now, he’s broken too many promises. Sonic isthe Peter Molyneuxof game characters ... Too soon?Sonic Runners is due out in spring 2015.
A Native American activist plans to lead a class action lawsuit against Facebook over its “real name” policy, which has drawn the ire of drag queens, domestic abuse survivors and political activists across the globe.The policy that once required users to use only their “real name” for their profiles came underrenewed scrutiny last yearafter drag queens in San Francisco reported being locked out of their accounts. Facebook restored the accounts, amended its policyand apologized– but groups who want their identities protected online say the changes are not enough.Dana Lone Hill isone of many Native Americansto report being suspended from their Facebook accounts, a process that blocks users from accessing any profile information until they provide proof of identity by handing over documents. Lone Hill was suspended after changing the account from her mother’s last name, Lone Hill, to her father’s last name, Lone Elk. Once her case was covered by national news outlets, service was restored.“I want to bring this lawsuit for Native America because these are our real names, these are the names that we were given, these were the names we were born with,” Lone Hill said.She and other members of the community suspect that part of the problem is that Native American names mix adjectives and nouns – leading them to look more suspicious under Facebook’s enforcement system.“I’m not saying it’s racism, I’m just saying they need to fix the system,” said Lone Hill.That system is closely guarded – even from activists who have been working with Facebook to reform its policies. What is known is that Facebook does not proactively search for names; instead, users flag names and a worldwide team looks at such reports to determine their legitimacy.“They have made it very clear that they don’t want to share how enforcement works because they think people will game the system,” said Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) activist Nadia Kayyali, who has discussed the policy with Facebook in private meetings.Kayyali said this was ironic because people are using the existing system to target groups.“If you continue to have ‘this account is using a fake name’ as a reporting option, that seems like you are encouraging people to just be harassing people by filing these reports as opposed to dealing with the behavior itself,” said Kayyali. “So they should really just get rid of the policy.”Kayyali said groups including LGBT youth, abuse survivors and political activistswere particularly harmed by the policy.In 2014,activists in VietnamandSyria reported beingbooted off the site in suspected targeted attacks by opposition forces, including the government. “In other places, [Facebook] is actually the form people use to speak out, so they are very much in danger of being targeted by aggressive governments,” said Kayyali.Facebook has long said that its policy on not allowing anonymous users is meant to limit abuse, though some, like Kayyali, think it encourages it.“Having people use their authentic names makes them more accountable, and also helps us root out accounts created for malicious purposes, like harassment, fraud, impersonation and hate speech,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.The companyhas expanded identification optionsto include allowing documentation that shows a user’s “authentic name”. This means providing two forms of identification that include a legal name and one piece of government-issued identification with a photo or birthday that matches the user’s profile.Facebook said it has made “significant improvements” in the last several months, including the expansion to let people use their “authentic name” instead of only their “real name”.“We have more work to do, and our teams will continue to prioritize these improvements so everyone can be their authentic self on Facebook,” the company said.Part of the process has made EFF and members of the San Francisco drag communityde facto customer service agentsfor Facebook. Lil Miss Hot Mess is a San Francisco drag queen who has been working with Facebook to communicate the needs of people who do not want to use their legal name on their accounts. On an average day, she sends 10 to 20 messages to Facebook containing information regarding people whose accounts have been erroneously suspended.Lil Miss Hot Mess said Facebook had promised changes that would help stop people from targeting communities and erroneously reporting its members, and to help people appeal cases in which they have been unfairly or erroneously reported.“Though we haven’t seen those changes yet,” she said.“We’re happy that Facebook is sort of taking small steps to make it more difficult for people to falsely accuse people of using fake names, but I still think there is this bigger issue of: do we have a right to choose our name on social media?” said Lil Miss Hot Mess. “And unfortunately even the move to the sort of authentic identity language hasn’t really addressed that.”The class action lawsuit is focused on Native Americans who say that they have been harmed by this policy. The drag queen coalition is also in communication with Lone Hill, though they are not involved in the lawsuit. “We see this as a broader issue that affects drag queens to Native Americans to survivors of domestic violence and transgender youth,” Lil Miss Hot Mess said.
Internet firm IFTTT has launched three smartphone apps under a new brand, Do, while renaming its original application as IF.The new apps – Do Button, Do Camera and Do Note – have been released for iOS and Android devices, with the aim of providing faster shortcuts to people’s regular digital tasks.The apps build on IFTTT’s original service, which connects to various other apps and sites and helps people create “recipes” to make them work better together: “if I upload a photo to Facebook, then back it up to Dropbox” and so on.“IFTTT has been about helping people automate things, and making connections that work for you in the background. It’s been very background and automation oriented, but the next set of products is moving to the foreground,” IFTT’s chief executive Linden Tibbets told the Guardian.“It’s about helping people take action, and do just what they want to do with the services and devices that they’ve already surrounded themselves with.”Related:IFTTT launches iPhone app: 'Mobile has always been in our plans'Each of the three new apps works in a similar way: once installed on someone’s homescreen, it can be set up with three recipes chosen from an in-app catalogue of possible actions.In Do Button’s case, those actions can be anything from sharing a current location, emailing a specific contact to say they’re on the way home or blocking off the next hour as “Do not disturb” in a calendar through to setting a Nest thermostat to a certain temperature.Do Camera focuses on photography, with recipes including creating a photo note in Evernote, uploading a shot to a specific Facebook album and posting a whiteboard note to Slack.Do Note, meanwhile, is a notepad app where notes can be quickly emailed, tweeted, created as calendar events, printed and various other uses. IFTTT’s theory is that the more internet services someone uses, the more recipes will be relevant within its new apps.“They effectively allow you to make your own app, effectively hacking something together that you wanted to do, but which takes a number of steps in whatever app you’d be using to do it,” said Tibbets.“We are currently limiting it to just three recipes, which allows us to keep the user interface really clean, so we can focus on helping people go from zero to three recipes. Although expanding that is something we think could be part of a forthcoming premium account.”That’s how the free Do apps tie in to IFTTT’s wider business, which to this point has been free to use, and funded by several rounds of venture capital funding – most recently $30m in August 2014.The company hopes that if power users chafe at the three-recipes limit in the Do apps, they might be prepared to pay for a premium account that might also add more features to the parent IF service.“The audience for this is going to be a wider audience than the folks who are currently using IFTTT,” said Tibbets. That said, IFTTT’s challenge will be explaining what Do is and how it works effectively enough to persuade those mainstream users to download it in the first place.Examples of recipes within Do Button and Do Camera.Those that do will find that IFTTT is onto something with its “programmable button” concept, though. Some of its uses are novelties, but many are genuine time-savers.For example, I email myself notes and links between 15 and 20 times a day – each time opening up my email app, typing the first few letters of my address, typing a subject, pasting in the body copy then tapping ‘send’.That’s where something like Do Note comes in, complete with the ability to work as a widget (including on iOS) to save small, but noticeable time on that particular task.It’s that relatively rare thing: an app that aims to get you spending less time using apps and more time engaging with the people and world around you. Mention of which sparked a conversation about Tibbets’ and IFTTT’s grander ambitions.“So many people are starting to hypothesise about what comes after apps. People tried to shoehorn the web into the mobile phone, that didn’t work, and that was one reason apps were able to live and thrive as the alternative,” he said.“We think a similar shift as we look at other modes of interaction. For virtual reality, Google Glass, Apple Watch and other wearables, the app metaphor doesn’t quite work.“Do is a step in this really interesting direction: they’re still apps, or at least they start as apps. But they allow you to think of them as functions: it’s a button, and you can connect that button to any of the other services that might be apps.”Mention of wearables provokes the obvious question about whether Do might not be as useful on a smartwatch – whether Apple’s or one of the growing number running Android Wear – as it is on a smartphone.Related:IFTTT: ' We're building an intelligence layer for the internet of things'“We think it’s an amazing fit for a watch. It’s something we’re certainly taking a look at. As a concept, this can really be a whole lot of things outside of being a set of apps. It could be a browser extension, a physical button next to your light-switch, or something in your car,” said Tibbets.“As a concept, a button that you can program to do exactly what you want it to do has legs beyond just being a set of apps.”Back to those ambitions. Tibbets talked about Do in terms of a “foundational layer for a future operating system”, before quickly stressing that IFTTT isn’t (yet) trying to go head to head with Google and Apple in building its own OS.“We think operating systems will begin to detach from the phone, and in fact they’ll no longer be so tightly coupled with any one device. Phones, TVs, cars will begin to operate across a service layer. You’ll have your phone in your pocket a lot more, but you’ll still be interacting with services in a physical environment,” he said.“We’re at the very early stages of exploring what these modes of interaction are. What does this future OS look like? The movie Her is a good example of what’s possible if you have this common services layer where you’re able to get the answers to things like ‘did I get an email from my boss? Was he upset? If so, respond with this…’“Or ‘lock this door, but make sure you unlock it when my mom comes over to feed the cat. If we ever have a system that’s going to do those things, this service layer has to exist. That’s the platform we’re trying to build.”
Some Samsung smart TVs are sending users’ voice searches and data over the internet unencrypted, allowing hackers and snoopers to listen in on their activity.The revelation comes 10 days after Samsung found itself in the middle of a row over the“Orwellian” privacy policyfor its smart TVs, after it was revealed that it was sending user voice data to third parties.It was believed that the information was encrypted but now a security expert has found that data is vulnerable while in transit. Samsung had stated that it uses “industry-standard security safeguards and practices, including data encryption, to secure consumers’ personal information and prevent unauthorised collection or use”, in a blog post clarifying its privacy policy.When a user carries out a voice search using a smart TV the audio is sent across the internet to a voice recognition service that interprets the speech and sends back the results in text.In some Samsung models, neither the audio, nor the text returned, is being encrypted, meaning hackers or snoopers can clearly see the words and phrases that users speak to the TV. The television also sends other personal information about the TV and user in the unencrypted information.The smart TVs, which can be operated by voice commands to adjust channels, can be used with natural language search. They can be activated with hot word “Hi TV”, which the television can be set to always listen out for. Samsung uses voice recognition company Nuance to power its voice command services.Security researcher David Lodgeof Pen Test Partners who tested Samsung’s UE46ES8000 smart TV, which was released in 2012 and is still available to buy today, said: “What we can see is it sending a load of information over the wire about the TV, I can see its MAC address and the version of the OS in use. After the word buffer_id is a load of binary data, which looks audio-ish.”Lodge found that the results of his voice recognition for the spoken word ‘Samsung’ were sent over the internet in plain text with confidence levels from the voice recognition servers.Photograph: Pen Test Partners“You can make out that it thinks I’ve said either Samsung, Samson or Samsong,” said Lodge.Related:Samsung's listening TV is proof that tech has outpaced our rightsThose looking to spy on smart TV users will need to hijack their internet connection, either through their Wi-Fi, their internet service provider or with access to the backbones of the internet, the kind of surveillance being carried out by GCHQ and other law enforcement agencies.A Samsung spokesperson told the Guardian that “Samsung takes consumer privacy very seriously and our products are designed with privacy in mind. Our latest Smart TV models are equipped with data encryption and a software update will soon be available for download on other models.”This is just the latest blow to Samsung’s smart TV line, which beganerroneously forcing pop-up adsinto third-party video apps without permission after a botched software update.
Google is preparing to launch a YouTube subscription service for viewers who don’t wish to see adverts.YouTube is “fine-tuning the experience”, according to Robert Kyncl, the online video service’s head of content and business operations, speaking at the Code/Media conference in California.Kyncl added that a subscription offering was important to YouTube because some viewers did not wish to sit through advertisements.YouTube has been exploring a paid, advert-free version of its service for some time, launching a pilot program in 2013 that allowed individual content providers to charge consumers a subscription fee to access a particular video channel.The company also launched its YouTube Music Key service in an invite-only beta form in November, which allows users to watch music videos without adverts. Subscribers are shown adverts on other types of videos, however.The move would allow YouTube to compete with companies such as Netflix and represent a significant change for the site, whose free ad-supported videos attract more than one billion users a month.YouTube’s@rkynclstressing the importance of an audience relationship, as well as creating smart content#codemediapic.twitter.com/UOZsgccOpY&mdash; Re/code (@Recode)February 18, 2015A total of 29 channels went live as part of the 2013 pilot, with partners including Sesame Street, UFC, National Geographic, PGA and Magnolia Pictures, charging $0.99 or more a month for paid channels that would sit alongside their free videos on YouTube.Some of those companies later revealed that their paid channels had got off to a slow start.“We had hoped to set the world on fire. We are not setting the world on fire right now,” said Adam Sutherland, National Geographic’s senior vice president of global strategy.Kyncl also added that YouTube’s growth had accelerated despite competition from Facebook and others, and was eager to encourage its best content creators through schemes such as Google Preferred.Launched last year, Google Preferred packages together the most popular YouTube channels and sells ads across them up front, in the same way that traditional TV ads are sold.Kyncl was referring specifically to Music Key, YouTube’s music subscription service, which was launched in a beta version late last year ahead of a full launch.“It is currently invitation only so I wouldn’t call it a launch just yet,” he said.“We’ve invited our best users - it will launch in a few months to the public. It is a very important part of business. There are audiences who just don’t want to see ads. and in music - they want things like offline access. We want to deliver to fans and we want to deliver to creators a new revenue stream. This is an important initiative for us.”This article was extended on 20/2/2015 to clarify that Kyncl was referring specifically to Music Key
Adobe’s Photoshop is now 25 years old and is arguably the pinnacle of photo editing. But, at £8.57/month, it’s also much more expensive than most people can afford, so here are 25 alternatives for 25 years of photoshoppery.The five best …Pixelmator - best for Mac£22.99 - OS XPixelmator is one of the best for OS X.Photograph: PixelmatorPixelmatoris arguably the best photo editor on a Mac. It handles even the largest photos with ease, replicates as many Photoshop tools as are generally required, as well as Photoshop file support, and has an excellent heal tool that can interpret what’s around it and fill in detail.Excellent for quick touching up of photos to detailed manipulation for novices and pros alike. There’s even a very capable £7.99 iPad Pixelmator app with many of the same tools and ease of use that make the Mac app great.Paint.net – best for WindowsFree - WindowsMicrosoft Paint on steroids.Photograph: Paint.netPaint.netstarted life as a simple replacement for Microsoft Paint, but evolved with new features such as multiple layers and more advanced photo editing tools. Today it is one of the fastest free photo editors for Windows, with a capable feature set that stops just short of some of the professional manipulation tools.Excellent for quick edits, crops and the majority of daily photo editing. Best of all, it’s free.Adobe Lightroom - best for bulk-managing photos£99 - Windows, OS XAdobe Lightroom 5 is available as a standalone product or as part of the company’s Creative Cloud subscription service.Photograph: AdobeArguably the best photo manager,Adobe Lightroomhas enough tools, even for professionals, to avoid having to open up a separate image editor, including some of Photoshop’s healing and manipulation tools. It also has a solid collection of batch processing and automated correction tools based on lighting, lens and camera models, which makes it fast for most jobs.Aviary Photo Editor - best for mobileFree - Android, iOSAviary for the iPad, iPhone and AndroidPhotograph: AviaryAviaryis a solid image editor with very capable image touch-up and resizing tools, now owned by Adobe. It’s straightforward interface makes it easy to use and has more to offer than most mobile editors obsessed with Instagram-style filters.Autodesk Pixlr - best in the browserFree - Windows, OS X, Android, iOS and webPixlr for Mac.Photograph: AutodeskPixlris a free jack of all trades photo editor with a solid tool set for almost any project. The web app is one of the most fully featured, while its mobile and desktop apps are also solid. Some of Pixlr’s most advanced features require a $15 a year subscription, but it has the backing of Autodesk, making of some of the best computer-aided design tools.The best of the rest …PaintShop Pro£48 - WindowsPaintShop Pro - Photoshop’s long-term rival.Photograph: CorelPhotoshop’s long-standing rival. PaintShop Pro is cheaper than its juggernaut of a rival but similarly specified. It lacks some of Photoshop’s most advanced features, and is bettered by some of its newer often-free competitors, but is still a capable editor.Serif PhotoPlus X7£79.99 - WindowsSerif PhotoPlusPhotograph: SerifPhotoPlus is a solid all-round image editor for Windows from the company that created Affinity Photo for OS X. It has a decent set of tools, including lens correction tools and other favourites of photographers. The only downside is that many of the advanced tools require more manual manipulation than some other programs and therefore it isn’t as beginner friendly.Photoshop Elements£79.10 - Windows, OS XPhotoshop Elements is Adobe’s cut-down image editor that includes most of the tools people use from the full Photoshop for a lesser cost.Photograph: AdobePhotoshop’s cut-down cousin Elements has improved dramatically over the last couple of years from a tool to avoid to a photo editor for everyone else. It has many of the same tools as its bigger brother, save for the advanced Content Aware Fill and a few other professional tools. Solid for most tasks, although free or cheaper tools with similar features are available.Acorn 4£22.99 - OS XAcorn 4 is a Pixelmator rival for Mac.Photograph: Flying MeatAnother excellent image editor for OS X, Acorn is billed as the “image editor for humans”. It’s packed with advanced tools and filters but has a stripped back, simplified user interface that is designed to be familiar to Photoshop users and easy to pick up for notices.Affinity PhotoFree - OS X (in beta)Affinity PhotoPhotograph: SerifAffinity Photo attempts to be Photoshop on a budget, but not dumbed down. It’s fast, packed with advanced tools and is aimed at professionals. Part of that tool set is end-to-end CMYK 16-bit per channel editing, RAW processing and a Photoshop Content Aware Fill-like tool called Inpainting.GimpFree - Windows, OS X and LinuxGimp is a fully featured image editor available for all major desktop operating systems.Photograph: WikipediaDespite the unfortunate name – GNU Image Manipulation Program – Gimp is one of the most capable free open-source photo editors available for Windows, OS X and Linux. It has some very powerful tools, but isn’t as user friendly as some others.Aperture£59.99 - OS XApple’s professional photo management and manipulation software, but Aperture will be replaced by Apple Photos in the near future.Photograph: AppleApple’s long-standing photo organiser and editor, Aperture is one of the most efficient ways of tweaking groups of photos, and making and reviewing small adjustments. The magnifying loop tool is particularly effective. It’s simpler to use than many of its competitors and can be used in conjunction with iPhoto.Apple PhotosFree - OS XPhotos is the successor to Aperture and iPhoto, due for release in the spring.Photograph: ApplePhotos is Apple’s replacement for both iPhoto and Aperture, which will be available in the spring. A preview was made available of the app, which is fast, with enough tools to make photo management and tweaks easy.PicasaFree - Windows, OS XGoogle’s Picasa is an photo management tool with built in editing functions.Photograph: WikipediaPicasa is Google’s photo manager and editor. It plugs into Google+, but is a solid simple organiser and can be accessed through the app or on the web. It has enough tools to quickly tune photos, with a few fancy filters thrown in.ACDSee Pro 8$99.99 - WindowsACDSee Pro 8Photograph: ACDSeeACDSee is an Adobe Lightroom analogue with photo management at its heart. It is fast and effective, but has limited metadata sorting and no automatic correction based on lens profiles. It has enough editing tools to improve the odd photo, but some of it can be a clumsy mix of destructive and non-destructive editing.The cheaper ACDSee 18 lacks some of the more advanced features but could be a good option for photo management.PreviewFree - OS XBehind the simple image viewer, Preview offers some useful image editing tools.Apple’s built-in image and document viewer for OS X is a bit of a dark horse. Underneath its simple viewing exterior hides a fast and effective image editor that’s perfectly capable of cropping, resizing, reformatting and simple touchups. It is particularly good at editing a bunch of images at once.Microsoft PaintFree - WindowsMicrosoft’s long-standing image editor is still available.Photograph: MicrosoftMicrosoft’s original image editor. It’s changed a bit in recent years and is still a solid, basic image editor. It’s worth a go for nostalgia’s sake at the very least, or for simple cropping and resizing jobs that really don’t require something as powerful as Photoshop.Sumo paintFree - webSumo Paint works straight in the browser.Photograph: Sumo PaintA Photoshop facsimile in the browser, the free Sumo Paint is an excellent quick photo editor. Many of the advanced tools are only available in a $19 pro version, but for straightforward touching up of images, resizing and similar the free editor does the job.PicMonkeyFree - webFast and effective for small edits without any extra software.Photograph: ScreengrabPicMonkey is free, browser-based image editor with a solid feature set for simple photo touchups, adding text to images and adding frames. Images can be taken from a computer or various cloud services, including Dropbox and Flickr. A paid-for upgrade removes the ads and gives access to more fonts and effects.FotoFlexerFree - webFotoFlexerBilled as “the world’s most advanced online image editor” it has numerous features for most types of editing. Image manipulation tools are just a simple click and drag-a-slider away, but most tools have little in the way of guidance so beginners might struggle. Those looking for more powerful fill features will need to look elsewhere.RibbetFree - webRibbet, as in the frog.Ribbet, despite it’s odd name and frog logo, is a quick and easy-to-use online image editor that does most of the editing for you, making it excellent for beginners or simple jobs. A few advanced tools are available, but better options are out there.FotorFree - Windows, OS X, iPhone, Android and webFotor’s got a Mac, Windows, iPhone and Android app.Photograph: FotorFotor is a free image editor that’s available on just about any platform either in app or web app from. It has a good selection of tools, each with an easy-to-use sliding scale of effect. Batch editing is a bonus, as are the filter tools.BeFunkyFree - Android, iOS and webBeFunky is a slick, browser-based photo editor.A quick and easy-to-use image editor that apes Instagram on the iPhone and Android, but with a few more tools. The web app is similarly simple, and solid for quickly customising photos before sharing them.SnapseedFree - Android, iOSSnapseed might have been sidelined for Google+, but the image editor is still one of the better ones around.Photograph: GoogleSnapseed is Google’s mobile image editor that’s been sidelined after it was acquired to be integrated into Google+. But the app still works and its tools, filters and easy-to-use touch controls are still some of the best around.Photoshop Touch£3.99 to £7.99 - Android, iOSAdobe’s mobile version of Photoshop is a capable touchscreen image editor.Photograph: AdobePhotoshop Touch is Adobe’s touchscreen focused mobile variant, but it isn’t nearly as powerful or feature rich as its namesake. It has a selection of photo filters and some decent touchup tools, but it’s biggest selling point is integration with Adobe’s Creative Cloud, which is useful for desktop Photoshop users.Adobe’s lighter Photoshop Express is also available for free with very basic tools.
Lenovo, the largest PC manufacturer in world, has been accused of fatally compromising user security by installing an adware application on all its Windows computers as they leave the factory.The software, called Superfish, purports to offer users a “visual search” experience. In actual fact, it injects third-party advertisements into Google search results and websites, without asking the user.But in order to place adverts on websites served to the user over an encrypted connection, as Google does by default,Lenovo owners report thatSuperfish also breaks the security used by every computer to access the internet privately. Even if the user removes the adware from their computer, the artificial security hole stays active. It leaves any Lenovo user permanently open to a “man in the middle” attack any time they use a public Wi-Fi network, letting an eavesdropper read users’ web browsing at will.Users had been complaining about Superfish on Lenovo’s forums sinceSeptember 2014, but it took until late January for the Chinese firm, which leads the PC market in terms of units sold, to respond. In the fourth quarter of 2014 alone,the company sold 16 m PCs, including the hugely popular ThinkPad range, which it bought from IBM in 2005.A representative for the companyposted on its forumsto confirm that it had stopped installing Superfish by default on new computers, “until such time as Superfish is able to provide a software build that addresses these issues.”“To be clear, Superfish comes with Lenovo consumer products only and is a technology that helps users find and discover products visually,” the representative continued. “The technology instantly analyses images on the web and presents identical and similar product offers that may have lower prices, helping users search for images without knowing exactly what an item is called or how to describe it in a typical text-based search engine.”“When using Superfish for the first time, the user is presented the Terms of User [sic] and Privacy Policy, and has the option not to accept these terms, ie Superfish is then disabled.”But users report that even if they decline the licence agreement, the software remains installed and even if the software is uninstalled, the security hole it opens up remains active.Lenovo told the Guardian in a statement that: “Lenovo removed Superfish from the preloads of new consumer systems in January 2015. At the same time Superfish disabled existing Lenovo machines in market from activating Superfish. Superfish was preloaded onto a select number of consumer models only. Lenovo is thoroughly investigating all and any new concerns raised regarding Superfish.”New root certificateIn order to put adverts in encrypted pages, Superfish installs a “root certificate” on users’ computers. Typically, when a user visits an encrypted page over an HTTPS connection, like an e-commerce or banking website, their computer uses the certificate of the page they’re viewing to encrypt the connection, hiding it from eavesdroppers.In order to check that the site’s certificate is valid, the computer looks to see whether it is verified by one of a few trusted “certificate authorities”, large security companies such as Symantec or Comodo.But the new certificate installed on Lenovo computers by Superfish lets the company replace the website’s security, with its own, so that it can insert adverts and pop-ups in the user’s browsing.The private key of the certificate has already been extracted from a compromised computer. Security researcher Robert Grahammanaged to retrieve the informationless than a day after the news broke. The key was protected with the password “komodia”,the name of a company which provides SSL hijacking software.The information extracted by Graham can now be used to break the security on every compromised Lenovo computer. This leaves infected users essentially open to any eavesdropping if they are using the net on a public Wi-Fi account, and also enables future malware authors to convince Lenovo owners that their software is produced by a trusted vendor, such as Microsoft.Rik Ferguson, head of security research at Trend Micro, said that “it is quite simply unacceptable to surreptitiously and without consent undermine the basic security of HTTPS by employing man-in-the-middle techniques, or any other techniques for that matter.Chris Boyd, Malware Intelligence Analyst at Malwarebytes, recommended that “in this particular case, anybody affected should uninstall the Superfish software then type certmgr.msc into their Windows search bar – from there, they can find and remove the related root certificate.”Userscan check whether they are affected by using Badfish, a tool built by coder Filippo Valsorda.Superfish has not responded to requests for comment.
Like many readers, I have several old PCs in my attic, all of which were set aside for one reason or another: old age, insufficient specs, malfunctioning software or hardware, etc. It seems a pity not to hand them on to someone who cannot afford a PC of their own, or recycle them.In the past, before disposing of an old PC, I’ve been advised to destroy the hard drive with a sledgehammer to prevent confidential data being passed on to some third party. Well, yes, but it then becomes a bunch of spare parts. I’d be grateful for some guidance, as I’d rather not take them to the council tip.LeslieThere are several issues here, so try to come to a clear decision about your preference for each PC. Is re-use the priority, or recycling? Are you happy to let an organisation decide for you? What most options have in common is the need to protect your identity and privacy without destroying the hard drive, so let’s start with that.Deleting personal dataFirst, back up and delete your personal data including documents and spreadsheets, photos and movies, email and messages and so on. Some of it may be hidden in application directories.If your old PC is connected to the internet, uninstall and de-register any programs that keep a count of the PCs on which they are installed. This may include versions of Microsoft Office and Office 365, Apple iTunes and so on. After that, create a new administrator account and use it to delete all the other accounts to remove any remaining personal data.One problem with computers is that deleting files doesn’t actually delete the files, it just removes them from the file system’s table of contents. The data is still on the hard drive and, until it is over-written, can be retrieved using an unerase program. To deal with this, download a free disk eraser such asEraserfrom Heidi Computers,Disk Wipe, orDarik’s Boot and Nuke. You can run the eraser from a USB thumb drive or whatever.Next, take your PC back to its factory condition by using the system restore function. To do this, interrupt the boot process by pressing, for example, F8, selecting Repair Your Computer, and then “Yes, reformat hard drive and restore system software to factory condition”. I’m quoting myDelldesktop: the keys and wording may vary on other systems. Alternatively, if you have Windows on DVD, you can boot and re-install Windows from the disc.Finally, use the disk eraser to overwrite all the “empty” drive space, so that deleted files can’t be undeleted.Of course, if a PC is going to be scrapped, you can just remove the hard drive and dispose of the non-working machine. You can mount the drive in an external enclosure and use it as a USB drive with your new PC. Note that you may need to “take ownership” to access the files. If so, Winaero’s freeTakeOwnershipExutility is a simple way to do this.Related:Raspberry Pi becomes best selling British computerRe-homing or recycling PCs locallyIt’s not easy to re-home an old PC, unless you know someone who needs one. If not, search for the exact model on eBay.co.uk to find out roughly how much it’s worth. If it has any value, you can either sell it or offer it via a free classified service (egGumtree), orFreegle, theReUseIt Network (RIN), or similarFreecycle-style group.If a PC isn’t worth very much, then it won’t be worth transporting it very far. This is less true of laptop PCs than of desktops, but much more true of traditional CRT-based monitors and TV sets. These contain hazardous chemicals as well as copper and rare metals, and should be taken to an approved recycling centre. You can find the nearest by entering your postcode in thebank locatorat Recycle-more.co.uk, or by checking your local authority’s website.Not all recycling centres are equipped to handle all types of waste. Look for one that takes “display equipment, general WEEE” as specified by the European Commission’s waste electrical and electronic equipment regulations. This covers household appliances and medical equipment, as well as consumer electronics goods from pocket calculators to giant TV sets. The Health and Safety Executvie (HSE) has aguide.Local councils are not obliged to accept your old PCs, and they may charge if you want them collected. However, under the UK’s WEEE regulations, retailers are obliged to take back old equipment if they sell you replacements (pdf). Check first as they may not accept old equipment at the store.National servicesDellhelped pioneer PC recyclinga decade ago, and it’s still doing it for consumers. If you buy a new PC from Dell, it willtake backwhatever it replaces, regardless of brand. It will also take back Dell PCs at any time. Dell covers the cost.Applefollows the WEEE regulations so if you buy a new Mac, it willtake backyour old computer and monitor – any make – at “any Apple retail store or Apple premium reseller”. These stores will also let you trade in some Apple products when buying new ones.Apple also promotes a recycling scheme run byDataserv, which will buy your unwanted equipment. However, it won’t take perfectly functional laptops in excellent condition – such as my PowerBook G4 – if they have no resale value. It only offered me £90 for a mint, unlocked iPhone 5, so if devices do have resale value, you’d be better off selling them privately.Commercial recyclers generally get most of their PCs from businesses, but they also work with schools, local councils and other organisations able to amass enough PCs to be worth collecting. The carriage costs make it uneconomic to collect PCs from individuals.UK IT Recycling Ltd, which I mentioned back in2007, refurbishes consumer laptops for “NHS trusts and self support groups throughout the UK”. Itaccepts donations from consumersat its recycling centre in Condover, Shrewsbury. Further, if want to donate a reasonably good, working laptop, it will refund your postage costs. (Check first!)Related:Security researcher publishes 10m usernames and passwords onlineOtherwise, there’sComputer Aid International, a charity that “aims to reduce poverty through practical ICT solutions”. It refurbishes equipment for use in hospitals, universities, schools and not-for-profit organisations in more than 100 countries. Again, it only wants PCs with usable specs, and if you’re a consumer, you pay for shipping, unless you can drop them off at itshead office in London N11.Both organizations promise to erase your personal data.Museum pieces?If you have something a bit unusual, or live close to a computer museum, that may offer another potential outlet. The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park has adonations page, but it’s not accepting donations at the moment: it has run out of storage space. But the new Centre for Computing History in Cambridge is stillaccepting donationsof a “a very wide range of electronic items” except TVs and CRTs – even things that don’t work.The CCH’s founder, Jason Fitzpatrick, says non-working PCs can be used for spares, and also for educational purposes. “Give kids a bunch of screwdrivers and they can take them apart and see how they work. I’m hoping to hook them into a life of tech. Things like iPads are sealed and so unapproachable now … .” I agree.If there’s a moral in all this, it is: Don’t put PCs in your attic. The quicker you dispose of them, the more likely they are to be useful to somebody else.Have you got a question? Email it toAsk.Jack@theguardian.com
Peter Molyneux may be enduring a rough month of criticism from players and journalists over his Kickstarter-funded Godus game, but fellow crowdfundee Tim Schafer has given the veteran designer his support.Schafer, whose company Double Fineraised $3.3m on Kickstarterin 2012 to make its Broken Age adventure game, sent a message to Molyneux as part ofhis latest video update on Double Fine’s progress.“The last thing I’d like to do is send our support to our friend and fellow developer Peter Molyneux,” said Schafer.“In the last few weeks, we’ve seen some extremely rough treatment of Peter on the internet and in the games press, and i think it’s really unfortunate and unfair, and I don’t think it’s healthy.”Molyneux has been fielding criticism for failing to deliver a number of the features promised in the Kickstarter campaign for Godus, whichraised £526k on the crowdfunding websitein 2012.Broken Age experienced its own challenges post-Kickstarter, taking longer to develop than Double Fine had expected. It has since been split into two episodes, with sales of the first providing more funding to finish the second.Related:Peter Molyneux interview: 'It's over, I will not speak to the press again'“Obviously things did not go as expected with his game, and because of that people are making some nasty accusations about Peter, and I can really relate to that, believe it or not!” said Schafer in his new video.“I’m not saying that developers like Peter and I shouldn’t be responsible and shouldn’t be accountable for deadlines. I’m just saying that the reaction to recent events and the tone of that reaction is really way out of proportion to the seriousness of the events themselves.”Double Fine is making a documentary of the development of Broken Age, which Schafer hopes will show gamers that “developers are human beings” whose creative ambition often encounters (or, indeed, causes) challenges.“I think it’s clear that the problems that Peter is having are not unique to him. and in fact they happen on many if not most projects,” said Schafer.Molyneux’s studio 22 Cans is pressing on with Godus as well as a new project, The Trail. In several press interviews, he has apologised to players for the missing features in the former game.“I suppose the big mistake was estimating how long the game would take to make. I very stupidly and naïvely didn’t build in enough contingency time into my predictions and I was 100% wrong,” hetold the Guardian.“My hope is that in six to nine months time, people start to finally see the game they really did pledge for. That will be two to three years into development but that’s kind of what it takes when you do an original game.”
Fresh from rumours that it israising fresh funding valuing the company at $19bn, Snapchat has launched a new feature that makes it easier for users to add music to the videos they share using its app.Snapchat can now take a live feed of whatever music or audio is currently playing on a user’s smartphone when they record a video, and use it as the soundtrack when they send the clip to friends or upload it to their “Stories” profile.The feature works with music apps including iTunes, Spotify and SoundCloud, and looks set to spark a new wave of “lip-dub” videos from Snapchat’s 100 million active users.That’s likely to be a headache for single-use apps likeDubsmash, which has been very popular with teenagers in recent months with its focus on lip-synching to music clips and film quotes.Another startup affected by the change isMindie, an app that adds music to people’s video clips then share them through various social apps. Snapchat was one of them, but recentlyblocked Mindie from its API.The new feature is Snapchat’s latest experiment with music. Major label Warner Music Group isone of the launch partners for its new Snapchat Discover section, while Madonna recentlydebuted her new music video within the app.Related:Ten things you need to know about SnapchatSnapchat has alsopromoted new artists like Goldroom, Guards and Smallpoolswhen launching new features,experimenting with a “tap to buy” feature for the latterto send fans to their iTunes page.In December 2014,leaked emails from the Sony Pictures hacksuggested that Snapchat chief executive Evan Spiegel had even greater ambitions in the digital music world, potentially even launching a Snapchat record label to promote more artists.For now, it will be Snapchat’s users promoting artists by including clips in their shared videos. What labels and music publishers make of the new feature remains to be seen, though.When rightsholders were striking licensing deals with companies like Spotify, there were unsurprisingly no provisions covering use of those streams to soundtrack videos shared through social messaging apps.
US startup LoopPay describes itself as “the most accepted mobile wallet on the planet”. Now it belongs to Samsung, after being acquired to bolster the company’s efforts to compete with Apple Pay and other mobile payments technologies.LoopPay’s technology helps retailers convert their existing magnetic-stripe readers into contactless payment receivers, with its app then used by smartphone owners to store their card details and pay for goods.“Our vision of inspiring consumers to transition from a physical wallet to a truly digital wallet will continue,” wrote chief executive Will Graylin in a message announcing the acquisition,posted on LoopPay’s website.“I’m most excited that Samsung shares this vision and has chosen to help change how we shop and pay for goods and services.”LoopPay and Samsung have already been working together, and the latter company was a strategic investor in the startup alongside Visa and US bank Synchrony Financial. Graylin said that his Boston-based firm will remain an independent team within Samsung.It’s a coup for Samsung, with its fierce rival Apple in the midst of an aggressive push to sign up retailers and financial firms in the US for its Apple Pay technology, which launched in late 2014.“Through this deal we can significantly accelerate our mobile commerce efforts,” said David Eun, executive vice president of Samsung’s global innovation centre.Related:Apple Pay on the way: why we may start shopping differently in 2015“LoopPay’s outstanding leaders and team have deep-rooted relationships with banks, card networks and merchants that will complement those Samsung has established over the years.”There have already been reports thatLoopPay’s technology may be a core feature in Samsung’s Galaxy S6 smartphone, which will be unveiled on 1 March ahead of the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona.Taking LoopPay in-house should smooth the process of integrating its technology into Samsung devices, while nixing the prospects of deals with rivals.The acquisition is the latest example of consolidation in the fast-growing mobile payments space. eBay has bought two such companies in recent years,paying $240m for Zongin 2011 followed by$800m for Braintreein 2013.Other deals includeAmazon buying GoPagoin 2013 andTwitter buying CardSpringin 2014. Google has reportedly been in talks tomake its own acquisition of mobile payments firm Softcard in 2015, meanwhile.

“You just got schooled... by a fish.” Business Fish certainly isn’t short on confidence, but who is this sharp-suited man with a fish’s head, and why is he popping up in the comments in a growing number of people’s Facebook feeds?The answer: Business Fish is one of the packs available on the social network’s Sticker Store, which has been quietly picking up steam in recent months.Found by tapping or clicking on the smiley face icon when commenting on a friend’s Facebook post, the store is currently focused on free packs of characters from individual designers, sticker studios like Quan and Ghostbot, and brands.The latter include Shaun the Sheep, Snoopy, Paul Frank, Pixar and various Cartoon Network shows, but it’s the surreal creations like Business Fish, Sinister Oyster and HamCat – yes, a cat with a slab of ham for a face – that appear to be catching on just as much.Quanis the Tokyo-based company behind Business Fish, as well as other sticker packs like Sugar Cubs, Yuttari Dragon, Yarukizero, Piyomaru and Masked Wrestler Q.

So you’ve bought a shiny new games console, or a ridiculously powerful PC, or the latest smartphone iteration, and now you want to play games on it. What happens next?Well, if you’ve been doing the whole gaming thing for years, you’ll know which review sites to go to, what developers and publishers produce the best stuff and what everyone is looking forward to playing. But if you’re just starting out, it can all be a bit … overwhelming. Every year around 1,000 new titles are released on consoles and PC, and there are more than 300,000 games available on the Apple App Store. So how are you supposed to work out what to play?Related:How do I start playing video games? A beginner's guideFollowing our Beginner’s Guide to Gaming, here are 20 titles which will get you started. We’ve included smartphone, console and PC titles, and instead of focusing on titles aimed specifically at non-gamers, we’ve tried to select excellent recent releases that will introduce you to more complex gaming experiences and represent where the medium is right now.

You plot your own route across the globe and just drink in the rich, branching story.Animal Crossing: New Leaf(Nintendo 3DS)The latest in a wonderfully bright and engrossing series of Nintendo games in which you simply live in a town filled with cute anthropomorphic animals, exploring, chatting and getting into adventures. The perfect travel companion.Civilization V(PC, Mac)Build your own civilisation from a roving tribe to an advanced high-tech society. The beauty of this complex strategy game is that it teaches you so much about how science and culture develop, while providing an engrossing gaming experience.Fifa 15(PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One)The latest football sim from Electronic Arts looks beautiful and with its four-player mode (two on each team) it’s a great one to load up when sport-loving friends come over. The basic moves aren’t hard to learn, but there’s depth for persistent players.Flower(PS3, PS4)Recently re-mastered for PlayStation 4, this gorgeous, relaxing game has you controlling the wind as it blows petals through the air. The sound and visuals are lovely and it’s something you can just toy with rather than try to “win”.Grand Theft Auto V(PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One)This vast crime epic is effectively the technical summit of mainstream game design. The violent narrative will upset some, but the game’s open-world environment is astonishing, allowing you to explore for hours as the radio plays and the city lives.Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft(PC, tablet)This two-player fantasy battle game uses a range of cards that depict heroes with different abilities – the way you place them effects the ongoing war. It’s extremely easy to get into, but very compelling, with lots of different strategies emerging as you collect different cards and expand your arsenal.The Last of Us(PS3, PS4)An apocalyptic adventure, set in the aftermath of a deadly fungal infection, this is one of the greatest works of cinematic game design. The lead characters – Joel and Ellie – are convincingly human and there are moments of extraordinary tension and wonder. Like GTA, however, it is very violent.Lego Marvel: Super Heroes(PC, PS3, PS4, Wii U, Xbox 360, Xbox One)The Lego games are a super introduction to the action adventure genre, allowing you to swap between a range of favourite characters as you complete missions.

Mario Kart 8 refines the recipe and adds new features. Get some friends around and have a tournament – there’s nothing like it.Minecraft(smartphone, tablets, PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One)The hugely successful block-building game allows you to explore vast landscapes, constructing your own houses, castles and whatever else you want to make, while avoiding zombies and mining for useful minerals. Endlessly creative and rewarding, and brilliant to share with children of all abilities.Monument Valley(smartphone, tablet)Stylish and evocative, this intriguing and masterfully constructed puzzle game was one of the best tablet titles of 2014. Players must guide their character through a series of tricksy landscapes that combine optical illusions and the impossible architecture of an M. C. Escher print. A perfect huddled-in-an-armchair, fireside gaming experience.Papers, Please(iPad, PC, Mac)Winner of 2014’s prestigious GameCity prize, this minimalist simulation puts players into the boots of a border guard at an Eastern European country, deciding who can pass through and who must be turned away based on a series of documents and ever-changing rules. Fascinating and informative in equal measure.Rayman Legends(PC, PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, Xbox One)This long-running series of inventive and welcoming platform games reached its zenith with 2013’s Rayman Legends, a delightful almost hallucinogenic romp, filled with Gallic eccentricities.Spelunky(PC, PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Xbox 360, Xbox One)An indie platform game that rebuilds its levels every time you play, offering an inexhaustible challenge. Superbly compulsive alone, but even more fun with a friend.Nidhogg(Mac, PC, PS4, PC Vita)A ridiculously competitive sword-fighting game, where players battle to reach the other’s base area in a series of quick, stabby encounters. Great two-player party fun, with a tournament mode for larger competitions.Stanley Parable(PC, Mac)One of the most unusual and inventive games of the decade is effectively a surreal exploration of what games are, and what their conventions mean. You may not know what’s going on, but you won’t want to leave.Talos Principle(PC, Mac)In the tradition of Valve’s classic Portal titles, this is a first-person puzzler that gets you to re-arrange objects, avoid guards and unlock a series of garden areas, while a philosophical god looks on. Sort of Crystal Maze meets Kant.Threes(iOS, Xbox One)Very much the crystal meth of smartphone puzzle games in terms of moreish appeal, Threes get you to move tiles on a small board to generate and combine multiples of three. Sounds simple, and it is. Sort of. What isn’t so simple, is stopping.Walking Dead(smartphone, tablet, PC, PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Xbox 360, Xbox One)Telltale’s harrowing adventure game takes the critically acclaimed comic book and TV series and turns them into an interactive drama where players have to make heart-wrenching decisions over who to save and how to survive. Grim, absorbing and extremely important as a landmark of video game storytelling.Other selectionsA few sites have covered this area already.

It took Aryok Piñera a week to make Mario lean properly.In the 1996 Nintendo game Super Mario 64, a player can instruct Mario to run forward; if he begins to turn left or right, he tilts to the side, like an airplane banking.Piñera, a 32-year-old technical artist living in Guadalajara, Mexico, is remaking Super Mario 64 in high definition, animating and programming his modification of the game from scratch in his spare time. He wants his Mario to move as he does in the original. “Mario has, I think, more than a hundred moves and actions,” Piñera explained to me over Skype, “each of which must be precisely designed and calibrated.”The villainous Goomba.Photograph: Aryok PiñeraIt’s a passion project, he says, inspired by his love of Nintendo. His hobby is extremely complex, and Mario’s lean proved most burdensome of all. He plunged into research, scouring the web for solutions. After dozens of hours of experimentation and testing, Piñera’s Mario now hops and pivots with his customary vigor.This is heartening news for followers of Piñera’s work, who are a scrupulous and attentive lot. Since Piñera unveiled his remake, then in its early stages in February 2014, he has been inundated with feedback both encouraging and cautionary. “Many people are very excited about this,” he says, “but I didn’t expect so much attention. It’s gotten out of control for me.”Mario is a character for whom gamers have a great deal of affection, and fans of Super Mario 64, widely considered among the most exemplary video game of its era, are unusually invested in the sanctity of a work they consider inviolable. Last year, Piñera posted a video to YouTube showcasing some of his remake’s technical development. The gaming community instantly objected: “Everyone complained that Mario looked too dark,” he remembers. “I was aware of that. But I didn’t want to show people the look of the game, I wanted to show the gameplay mechanics. But obviously the first thing people see is how it looks.”Aryok Piñera, Super Mario 64’s modder.Photograph: Aryok Piñera.Now, Piñera explains, Mario “looks awesome and colorful”, as he does in the original game – one of the many improvements he has implemented in his continuing effort “to please all the fans”. Piñera started work on the game in January 2014. In the beginning it was something he could devote himself to, alone, almost obsessively: he was out of work at the time, and found himself spending 12 hours a day on the project every day for two months. But when word of his endeavor spread online, amateur developers from across the globe offered to help. Piñera now leads a motley team dozens strong.He has more than 30 musicians composing and recording a high-definition version of Super Mario 64’s original soundtrack, and scores of designers and animators contributing models and graphics. A Facebook page set up to field prospective volunteers has nearly 2,000 members; Justin Crouch, Piñera’s “community leader”, recently restricted the page’s activity in order “to assure quality control”.But why are people so happy to tender free assistance?Leonardo Fragoso, a 21-year-old Nintendo enthusiast living in Rio de Janeiro, told me he felt it was his “duty” to join Piñera’s cause. He spent “at least two hours a day for the last six months” working on textures and models, though he concedes that he is “not a developer and never had any experience with it” – but he is willing to teach himself if it will make him more useful. “I had to learn pretty much everything,” he says. “I want to give back all the joy I had with the original game.”Related:It's complicated: why playing a video game is like having a relationshipJamin Warren, founder of the video game magazine Kill Screen, says that this sort of devotion isn’t so unusual. “That desire to want to extend the value of a particular universe generally speaks to how invested people are,” he explains. “They don’t want the end to be the end and they want to have their own piece of the puzzle.” He likens the impulse to the one that governs the Emmy-winning fan edit Star Wars Uncut, or Sena Jeter Naslund’s speculative Moby Dick “sequel” Ahab’s Wife. Even Fifty Shades of Grey began as a work of Twilight fan fiction. The major distinction of a game modification or remake is the technical dimension. “Games are a fully digital art form,” Warren says. “By virtue of that, their pieces as a whole can be reconstituted in different ways.”As indeed they often are. What Piñera is doing with Super Mario 64 belongs to the rich tradition in the gaming industry of what are referred to as “mods” – amateur games that have been derived from professional ones. Mods sometimes offer chiefly cosmetic upgrades or alterations, like bringing Mario to HD; other times the changes run deeper, and the games are improved or re-imagined to incalculable degrees. Some of these are spoken of reverentially.In 1998, a developer by the name of Papyrus Design Group released Grand Prix Legends, a racing game about the 1967 Formula One series. It was, quite notably, the first game of its kind to boast a convincingly realistic physics engine – one that took into account all four wheels of a car, rather than, as in most racing games, an invisible pivot point in the center of the vehicle. But the project fell apart before completion, and the game went to market unfinished: despite its groundbreaking technical achievement Grand Prix Legends was basically unplayable. And so the mod community seized upon it. Modders fixed the game: they adjusted the AI, whipped the multiplayer into shape, overhauled the design. This new iteration was released online for free, and the game became a phenomenon. People are still refining and enhancing it, and 15 years later Grand Prix Legends is still talked about and played.‘I want to give back all the joy I had with the original game.’Photograph: suppliedBut is this all legal? Jon Festinger, a lawyer who teaches a class on video game law at the University of British Columbia, says that the legality of modding “cannot be characterized as anything but uncertain”. Developers and publishers have sued some modders for infringing on their copyright, and many more have sent out letters to cease and desist. But these have all been lower court decisions, and there is no definitive precedent. What has emerged is something of a tenuous armistice: modders are implicitly permitted to keep modding, so long as “gamers mod not for commercial interest, and not out of trying to damage to someone’s copyright”.Festinger says that in general, modding is in a game developer’s interest. “There are lots of compelling reasons to be pro-mod,” he argues, “and most video game companies are. It adds to their work.” Mod activity means more interest in the original game, which can mean an increase in sales. “At the very least,” he says, “modding creates interest, it creates community, it creates a greater commitment to the game, it shows that people believe in the game and like the game. These are all things that developers would like.”Still, a developer or publisher may not be so keen. In 2003, an upstart programmer named Nathan Lazur decided to follow through on an ambition he had as a teen: he would remake his favorite Super Nintendo game, Chrono Trigger, for the more powerful Nintendo 64. He assembled a small team of collaborators and “put all our time and our money” into creating a functioning demo that they could show off. “Around the summer of 2004,” Lazur told me, “we had a decent amount of the demo completed. People we showed the game to were saying that we should present it to the public because it was looking so good.” Skeptical but excited, they “spent the resources to make a fancy website and sprinted to show the world our efforts around E3”, the world’s largest gaming expo. The project blew up online. But it also aroused the attention of Square Enix, the published of Chrono Trigger. “I received an email from a Square Enix lawyer with a cease-and-desist letter,” Lazur remembers. “I was heartbroken.”The mod community’s greatest success story is Counter-Strike, an online multiplayer shooter developed by amateur programmers Minh Le and Jess Cliffe and derived from the Valve Corporation’s hugely popular Half-Life. Le began work on Counter-Strike as a hobby at age 22, while he was studying computer science at Simon Fraser University. “I started doing it just for fun,” he told me by Skype. “I was working on it probably 30 hours a week at first, putting school on the backburner. When you enjoy doing something it doesn’t feel like work.” He guesses he invested more than a thousand hours of his free time to the task.Modders: living on the edge?Photograph: Aryok PiñeraCounter-Strike doesn’t differ much from Half-Life – “it was fairly superficial stuff,” Le concedes – but the rules Le devised and imposed represented a major shift in the way people played multiplayer shooters. The influence of Le’s work can still be felt today. Le and Cliffe released the first version of Counter-Strike for free online in 2000. “After six or seven months,” Le remembers, “the popularity grew so large that we began to get the attention of a lot of game companies.” When Valve offered to buy Counter-Strike and hire Le and Cliffe to continue working on it professionally, they “just jumped on it”. Almost overnight, this hobby had become a bona fide career.Le says that modding is like making music in your basement. “There are a lot of struggling musicians out there who do it for the love of having a creative outlet” – and in some cases, those struggling artists come to live on their art.For Piñera, all of this seems distant and abstract. “I don’t really think about that,” he tells me earnestly. “If the time comes,” he says, “I would like to do even more. I have a lot of ideas in my head.” And if Nintendo drops the hammer, he is comfortable with that too. “Nintendo could sue me,” he admits. But he can’t reject his passion. “Even if I don’t share anything, I will keep working alone in silence. I will keep doing it, without a doubt.”
The web is about to get faster thanks to a new version of HTTP – the biggest change since 1999 to the protocol that underpins the world wide web as we know it today.Hypertext Transfer Protocol is familiar to most as the http:// at the beginning of a web address. It governs the connections between a user’s browser and the server hosting a website, invented by the father of the web Sir Tim Berners-Lee.What is HTTP/2?HTTP/2 is the next version of HTTP and is based onGoogle’s SPDY, which was designed to speed up the loading of web pages and the browsing experience. It is a new standard and will take over from the current protocol HTTP1.1 used by most sites on the internet today.What’s the difference?HTTP/2 is a more modern protocol that essentially speeds web browsing up using new ways of transporting data between the browser and server across the internet.It is backwards compatible with HTTP1.1 and uses most of the same technologies, but it is more efficient and allows servers to respond with more content than was originally requested, removing the need for the user’s computer to continually send requests for more information until a website is fully loaded.Browsers can also request more than one piece of data at a time from one site and request data from several websites at once, again speeding up the process of loading single or multiple websites.Will I actually see a difference?Yes. Web pages will load much quicker compared to those using HTTP1.1. High-speed broadband internet connections already mean web pages load much faster, but the new protocol will allow webpages and browsers to take advantage of the increased bandwidth. Modern sites that have lots of images, text and data could load dramatically faster at first, although caching on a computer means that the benefits won’t be so obvious after the first loading of the site.The new protocol will also speed up mobile browsing, which is often held back by the extended time it takes for a request to travel from a smartphone or tablet to the website server over a mobile broadband connection. Allowing the mobile browser to request more than one item at the same time should cut load times considerably.Will I have to do anything?No. From the user’s point of view nothing changes other than the speed. The address bar will still show http://, if at all, and the browser will automatically switch between HTTP1.1 and HTTP/2 as required.Google Chrome users have been using SPDY protocols with Google services and a few other websites for the last two years and probably haven’t noticed.What about HTTPS?The secure version of the web used by banks, shops, email and other services will remain the same. HTTP/2 has full support for encryption in the same way HTTP1.1 does, and will not change the way users access secure services.HTTP/2 requires an improved version of the transport layer security (TLS1.2), which was standardised in 2008 and offers better security than previous versions and should already be used by the majority of services.When will I see it?The HTTP/2 standard has nowformally been approvedby the Internet Engineering Task Force and will be published soon. At that point it is up to websites, hosting services and companies such as Google to implement the standard.Google has already said that it’s current SPDY protocol will be withdrawn in favour of HTTP/2 in Chrome by early 2016. It is likely that we’ll see high profile websites and services, including those who have implemented SPDY – including Google, Twitter, Facebook, Wordpress and Yahoo – in the near future.
When One Direction split up, expect wall-to-wall media coverage of tearful fans, career-montage clips and speculation about which of the individual band members will be most successful as a solo star.Thesplit of YouTuber supergroup Our2ndLifein December 2014 didn’t raise quite as big a rumpus in the mainstream media, but the response from fans was just as heartfelt. Yes,of course there was a hashtag for that.It was no surprise, given that a survey commissioned by Variety earlier that year found thatonline stars were often more influential than traditional pop, film or TV starsfor American teenagers.Related:YouTube: PewDiePie, DC Toys Collector and Katy Perry top in 2014In Our2ndLife’s case, each individual member already had their own solo career underway through their own YouTube channels. Now, two of them – Kian Lawley and Jc Caylen – haveteamed up for a new onewhich they hope will be a launchpad for new kinds of videos.“On Mondays, we do challenges – a fan favourite – and sit-down videos where we talk about specific topics. We also write and direct our own cinematic short films and sketches, which usually air on Fridays,” Caylen tells the Guardian.“We’re really excited to be working with a full sound and film production team to create higher quality videos. We’ve already learned a lot about the production process and we can’t wait for our audience to see what we have in store next,” adds Lawley.Its blend of painful stunts, chat about girls and dressing-up skits follow the now-classic YouTube dynamic of being irresistible to teenagers and baffling to their parents, although the step up in production quality for the Friday films is noticeable.The pair have heavyweight backing for their ambitions. Their new channel is part of the Fullscreen multi-channel network; they’re managed by Andrew Graham from another MCN, Big Frame; and they’re clients of Hollywood law firm Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum Matlof + Fishman.Hence the ability to work with a professional crew for their Friday short films. The new channel – which already has more than 780,000 subscribers on YouTube – is also likely to lure in a few brands, given the roll-call (MTV, Axe, Hulu, AT&amp;T, Universal Pictures etc) associated with Our2ndLife.YouTubers are the new teen celebrities as that Variety poll showed, although Caylen still sees differences between the two worlds. “While the lines are definitely being blurred a bit, there is definitely still a difference between YouTube celebrities and mainstream celebs,” he says.“Through YouTube, we’ve been able to create a personal connection with our viewers. We’ve been told by fans that when they watch our videos they feel like we’re talking directly to them. It’s really the connection with our fans that make us love producing videos so much.”Lawley adds that Twitter has been important to the pair’s rise so far. “We can talk and get feedback about our videos directly from some of our biggest fans,” he says, mirroring Caylen’s views on the benefits of this interactivity: “We can’t stress the importance of that connection enough.”Like a growing number of YouTubers, the pair are also setting their sights on feature-length films, even if the results are more likely to be distributed via iTunes than cinemas. Lawley has just finished shooting his first film,The Chosen, and is enthusiastic about the experience.“Working with a full Hollywood team has been an awesome learning experience, and I definitely want to pursue acting more. Jc and I love our YouTube audience, and we’re going to keep producing videos, but we’re also really interested in learning what other opportunities are out there,” he says.“We’re currently talking with Hollywood producers about new projects and also learning how to produce our own videos. We love trying and learning new things, so I’m excited for all of our upcoming projects,” adds Caylen.Related:YouTube stars Rooster Teeth, Our 2nd Life and Nash Grier set for filmsGrace Helbig, Hannah Hart and Mamrie Hart’s filmCamp Takotasold hundreds of thousands of copies on iTunes and other digital stores in 2014, while fellow YouTubers Shane Dawson and Cameron Dallas also saw their films rank high in Apple’s sales chart.Fullscreen recently announced plans for a slate of new filmsincluding vehicles for comedy studio Rooster Teeth and YouTuber Nash Grier, as well as a documentary on Our2ndLife’s final tour called #O2LForever.Lawley and Caylen are hoping that their partnership will pay off across all screens, fuelled by the new channel. “The key to a successful collaboration is definitely chemistry. Kian and I have been making videos together for years now, and I couldn’t think of a better friend to collab with,” says Caylen.“We took our experience from the past few years and really tried to add to it and differentiate ourselves from other collab channels,” says Lawley. “To all of our viewers out there - expect the unexpected.”
My significant other works for Electronic Arts and I’m what you might call a disgruntled spouse.It was with these words 10 years ago that Erin Hoffman beganan online journaldetailing her husband’s gruelling experience working at an EA game development studio. For months on end he worked 12-hour days, six days a week, and when the game’s final deadline loomed, it got worse. “The current mandatory hours are 9am to 10pm – seven days a week,” she wrote, “with the occasional Saturday evening off for good behavior (at 6:30pm).”For many gamers, the EA Spouse web post, as it was known at the time (Hoffman had to remain anonymous to protect her husband’s job) offered a first glimpse into the video game industry’s secret world of “crunch” – vast periods of mandatory, but often unpaid, overtime that would often kick in during the months leading to a release date.The article went viral, spreading across forums and news sites, and provoking a wave of controversy and condemnation. Very quickly it became clear that the most shocking thing about the EA Spouse story was that, within the industry, it wasn’t shocking at all. It was just how things worked. Game development surveysconducted by the International Game Developers Association in 2004showed that only 2.4% of respondents worked in no-crunch environments and 46.8% received no compensation for their overtime.Thanks to EA Spouse, however, it looked like change was coming – and, as usual, it would begin with a court case. A class action suit, filed against EA for failure to pay overtime to its employees, was eventually settled for $15.6m (£10m). A second suit followed in 2006, this time settling for $14.9m. In both cases, EA relied on vagaries of American law that classify some IT professionals as exempt from overtime pay. The settlement in the second case featured a quid pro quo: employees would be reclassified in order to get overtime but would give up their stock options.For industry insiders, the lid was supposed to be off; if one employee could speak openly about labour issues (Hoffman herself worked in the industry at the time), then surely everyone could? And if that happened, the problem would surely go away?Work late, come home, sleep in between stressing about bugs and end up dreaming about code, go back into work and repeatAnonymous programmerEndless crunchBut, a decade after EA Spouse, it’s questionable how much has actually changed. Statistically, things appear better. In 2004, the IGDA – the only large organisation advocating for labour rights in the US games industry – started a regular “quality of life” survey in response to the EA controversy, polling staff on working standards and practices. Its latest numbers from the 2014 report show a decline in intensity.“Over the last decade, the average amount of crunch time worked has dropped, with 19% of 2014 respondents indicating they haven’t crunched in at least two years compared to 2.4% of 2004 respondents,” says Kate Edwards, the IGDA’s executive director. “Also, 38% of the 2014 respondents reported typical crunch times of 50-69 hours per week compared to 35% of 2004 respondents reporting crunch times of 65-80 hours per week.”But the take from Edwards is of the glass-half-full variety. Despite the drop in intensity, the industry baseline is that only one-fifth of industry workers don’t crunch at all, and nearly two-fifths still crunch more than 50 hours a week. Furthermore, current and former industry workers interviewed for this feature revealed deep dissatisfaction with crunch and a sense that, even if it’s not as acute as it was a decade ago, it’s still worse than they can tolerate.“This year is my first experience with long stretches of crunch, and my girlfriend, who I live with, feels like she hardly sees me,” relates one programmer at a leading games studio who, like almost everyone else we spoke to, asks to remain anonymous. “It’s a common source of tension. My generally much higher level of stress takes its toll on my mood outside work so it bleeds into everything. Work late, come home for a few hours of food and exhausted conversation, go to bed, sleep in between stressing about bugs and end up dreaming about code, get up feeling half dead then go back into work and repeat.”Studio managers have realised that EA-Spouse-type situations mean bad PR, so soft pressure is widely taking the place of mandatory overtime. This may be as simple as encouraging a culture of peer pressure: quietly exploiting the natural desire to do well is a method that many of the staff we spoke to had encountered. However, we were also told of managers who noted which staff had put in the most hours when making a potential layoff list.Game design is a dream job for many people.Photograph: Michael Nelson/EPA‘Teams become addicted to crunch’“Most workers are in the industry because of a passion for games,” says one engineer formerly with Turbine Inc, a studio best known for fantasy adventures Lords of the Ring Online and Asheron’s Call. “Even if management sets unrealistic goals for a release, the workers usually want to try to meet those goals because it may very likely make a better game”.“Sometimes it seems like managers and producers almost get addicted to crunch. If they’re able to get their team to go above and beyond to finish an important project on time or early, it can make the team and manager look better. That success leads to more responsibility, more projects and more political capital, which can require more crunch time to complete. I’ve had to fight pretty hard with managers and directors to reject work so that co-workers and I don’t burn out.”Students and young new entrants to the industry see crunch and unpaid overtime as price of admissionMarie-Josee LegaultThe pressure comes from consumer expectations, as well. With development budgets ballooning, failure can be catastrophic, so the temptation can be to pack in more features – more cool stuff – to appease the demanding audience. This leads to the twin spectres of crunch and layoffs, as studios grow to accommodate ambitious ideas, then downsize or collapse when the resulting game fails to make a profit.“Generally I feel crunch most often results from the conflict between manpower, consumer expectations and quality of the product,” says an engineer currently working at an EA studio. “It’s the classic two-out-of-three question: you can’t have good, fastandcheap; pick two. There are certain levels of consumer expectations and quality you can’t sacrifice, so manpower gets hit, both in temp workers and in overtime across the board.”‘Crunch shows a lack of proper management’Crunch has many causes. The most common theory is that the industry is simply too young and too fast-moving to integrate proper management techniques. “Our project was huge and our overall quality assurance process at the time was very basic and waterfall-esque,” recalls one quality assurance worker at EA. “We were testing in a really stupid way and just churning out bugs, but so much of the code was new, so it kinda made sense then. Looking back on it now, everyone agrees that it was laughably inefficient.”Crunch in this sort of working environment becomes a self-perpetuating problem. In Fred Brooks’s book on software management,The Mythical Man-Month, he posits that the more people added to a software project, the less efficient the whole team works, which then extends the project further.Recent datacollected by the Games Outcomes Project and shared on the website Gamasutra backs up the view that crunch compounds these problems rather than solving them. The multipart study examined how work practices affect game review scores. In conclusion? “Crunch does not in any way improve game project outcomes and cannot help a troubled game project work its way out of trouble.” And yet the industry still defaults to crunch when a deadline looms.It’s easy enough to understand how small indies with their limited resources may recourse to crunch in this way. But why are the large companies the biggest offenders? If we’re to accept the young industry theory of crunch, big studios should have the resources – if not the management acumen – to address the problem.The answer, as Nick Dyer-Witheford and Greig de Peuter point out in their book, Games of Empire, is that the big players don’t address it because it’s in their economic interests not to. “Normalised crunch time points to an elementary fact: it is a good deal – a steal, in fact – for game companies,” they write.Crunch is the cheapest way to meet a deadlineFar from being the result of management failure, what EA Spouse demonstrated was that crunch is built into the schedule. It’s not a failure of the system – itisthe system. Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter go on to show how EA and other large companies lobbied the Canadian government to introduce software employee overtime exemptions similar to those in the US Fair Labor Standards Act. Crunch was the desired outcome – not because it would allow for better games, but because it was the cheapest way to meet the deadline.This attitude hasn’t been banished to the management graveyard; it’s still very much part of industry thinking. “Hourly employees in California are required by law to get overtime if they work more than eight hours in a single day or 40 hours in a week,” explains a current employee of Carbine. “Salaried employees are exempt from such laws. What winds up happening at Carbine (and I believe other NCSoft subsidiaries) is when an hourly associate gets promoted to a staff-level salaried job, they retain their hourly wage and get a very slight pay bump. So no longer is the hourly associate working overtime and getting $72,000 a year for it. Instead, the newly promoted staff member is making $52,000 and still works the same amount of crunch hours as before.”I was a ​​quality tester and worked 72 hours a week, testing GTA. It was horrendous. I didn’t see daylight for monthsEx-Rockstar workerCrunch is the price of a job in the macho games industryWith the pressure to deliver so high and with long working hours ingrained into the development culture, there is a risk that the battle against crunch has essentially been lost. Younger workers view it as the industry’s price of admission.A team of Canadian researchers including Marie-Josee Legault, Johanna Weststar and Pierson Browne are currently examining work experiences and quality of life in the industry. The team also helps the IGDA with their surveys. Their response to a question about whether younger workers and students are more accepting of crunch is striking.“There is a survey question – in the DSS IGDA survey 2014 – that asks respondents to agree or disagree with the statement, ‘Crunch is a necessary part of game development’,” says Legault. “If we look at the responses to that question for people who identified as students and people who did not, we see a quite striking difference. The majority of non-students (55%) disagreed or strongly disagreed to the statement that crunch is necessary. Among student respondents, 26% agreed or strongly agreed that crunch is necessary. Only 38% disagreed or strongly disagreed and over a third (36%) could neither agree nor disagree. There is a higher level of initial acceptance to the notion of crunch.“Arguably this is what the industry relies upon – the ability to continually take on young and willing new entrants, and to replace those who burn out or otherwise leave for something else. It is fair to say that students and young new entrants to the industry do see crunch and unpaid overtime as price of admission – as ‘the way it is in games’.”The researchers also point out that, over the 10 years the IGDA has surveyed the industry, the mean age of workers has not changed. Essentially, the maturation of the industry is stunted. Often, pressure to revise labour policy is brought by those with families and health issues. With the industry remaining overwhelmingly young and single, pressure from that quarter never materialises. And, with new workers accepting crunch as a matter of course, there is a risk that it never will.‘I worked 72 hours a week, doing night shifts’“I’ve lost one relationship and currently spend a large amount of time dealing with balancing work requirements with my new wife,” says one ex-Rockstar worker. “It’s still a constant stress of ‘are you coming home on time tonight?’ We’re about to start a family, and I’m almost dreading having to deal with work’s crunch requirements and home life. It seriously makes you question why you do this when you foresee these things. You look around and think, I could get paid more to do a boring version of this job elsewhereandhave a social life. Is it worth the stress?“I was a quality assurance tester at Rockstar, and at its worst, we worked 72 hours a week. I was one of the unlucky ones to be working the night shifts. That’s 8pm-8am, six days a week, testing Grand Theft Auto. It was horrendous. I didn’t see daylight for months. This was perceived as a requirement and if you had issues with it, you were told ‘Well, you can go stack shelves at Tesco instead or answer phones at a call centre’. You were treated as disposable.”The industry insidiously aligns crunch with passion. It’s a message that is readily apparent in any number of job postings or recruitment videos: if you love games you need to put in the hours. But this combination of passion and expectation can create intolerable pressure. “It’s absurd. It burns out our most passionate workers,” says Tanya Short, head of Kitfox Games. “It makes them believe in the martyr syndrome and pushes out all of those voices that literally cannot afford to give away their personal lives.”So while statistics show improvements to the crunch culture, young fanatics keen to prove their passion can easily slip into destructive modes of working. As another ex-Turbine employee told us, crunch comes with its own macho myths: “There are seasoned veterans out there trying to make this a real career, not just that thing they did for a year when they were 20 and ate ramen, and ‘omg do you remember that gross couch at the office we used to pass out on’? But as game devs, I think we still sort of perversely like this maverick sensibility around our jobs that makes us sort of figures of martyrdom in the name of art. There’s this smug, holier-than-thou attitude sometimes.”Working in games design shouldn’t mean eating all of your meals out of a box in the office.Photograph: Martin Godwin/Martin GodwinLabour institutions, cultural memory and slow actionThe industry’s trade organisations don’t seem inclined to weigh in on crunch any time soon. Britain’s trade body for games, UKIE (United Kingdom Interactive Entertainment), declined to comment on crunch. Its North American equivalent, the ESA (Entertainment Software Association), would only provide a terse statement: “As a trade association and the voice of the entire industry, we can’t speak to individual publisher or developer issues.”This seems to place the onus on publishers to solve what is clearly an industrywide, systemic issue. But if economic factors favour crunch, it’s unlikely that these companies will rush to get their own houses in order.The IGDA’s Kate Edwards asserts that her organisation “maintains a positive relationship” with the ESA, but thinks more needs to be done. “The ESA could certainly help improve the situation by more actively partnering with the IGDA in addressing and communicating the concerns of individual developers around working conditions and quality of life issues,” she says.The developers the Guardian spoke to were nearly unified in their frustration with the IGDA. Half wanted the organisation to be more forceful, the other half said they didn’t deal with the IGDA at all. Some responses were forcefully negative, dismissing the IGDA as a “sham organisation” and “a joke”. The problem is, while the body is trying to bridge the gap between workers and management through non-confrontational means, it occupies a space in which it is not as actively pro-labour as many in the trenches would like, while still being an annoyance to certain sectors of management.It’s a fun job, but it shouldn’t be an exploitative oneChris Avellone, Obsidian EntertainmentThe need to appease both parties can lead to blow-outs. In 2013, current bot programmer and former video game engineer, Darius Kazemi, resigned from the IGDA’s board of directors. The reasons he citedin his blogwere numerous, but the primary motivation was his belief that the IGDA didn’t do enough to shake up the status quo.The Canadian researchers were more sympathetic to the IGDA’s predicament than Kazemi or the workers spoken to for this feature. “In its current form, the IGDA is funded by studios and can’t in any way play the role of a union, and couldn’t be expected to do so,” says Legault. “Their primary focus is to promote the industry and support individual workers through training, networking and professional development initiatives. The IGDA relies on volunteers and the activity of its members to join Special Interest Groups on particular topics… The IGDA does not have the resources, or the independence from studio executives, to act like a union.”For her part, Edwards sees the IGDA as a primarily educational body. “The IGDA’s role is to keep shedding light on industry practices from the individual developer’s perspective and continue to raise those concerns with company and other industry representatives,” she states. “There is always room for improvement in our advocacy efforts and we continue to work on ways to make our organisation more effective.”Designers should be sleeping at home, not in the office.Photograph: Yagi Studio/Getty ImagesThe future of crunchSoftware development is high pressure, susceptible to sudden market changes, and lacks an institutional memory of labour negotiations. Consequently, we see the same crunch patterns throughout the ICT sector.Amazon has been under firein recent years for labour abuses, while the more strictly software-orientedGoogle has been facing periodic lawsuits over unpaid overtime.It could be thatas the games industry matures it will simply evolve out of these destructive working practices. Traditionally, development studios have been male-dominated, leading to a macho culture in which extended working hours become a bragging currency. As the workforce becomes more diverse, this culture may be challenged.Alternatively, veteran developers who stay within the industry could mitigate crunch by taking a proactive stance and integrating good practices from the top down. Several of the developers we spoke to have dedicated themselves to just that, forming small- and medium-sized studios where decisions are geared toward cutting crunch as much as possible.‘The job is fun, but should never be more than 40 hours per week’Veteran game designer Chris Avellone, now co-owner of Obsidian Entertainment, focuses on downscaling. He believes that, at many companies, there’s a tendency to create more content than teams can digest. “Developers and managers should never have to work more than 40 hours a week,” he says. “It’s a fun job, but it shouldn’t be an exploitative one. Everyone has a life. Let them live it, it’s short enough as it is.“And for developers that do want to work more than 40 hours a week, be responsible with your passions. If you develop more content than the pipeline can support, you’re causing others to have to pick up the baton and devote additional hours for polish, testing, balance, VO and any number of tasks that your additional work has generated. Managers and developers both should be receptive to downscaling work; in many cases, that can help create a superior product that’s more fun and more focused.”Another manager, who asked to remain anonymous, concurs with Avellone that managing scope is the No 1 management level issue. “[My current employer] has been a real breath of fresh air,” he says. “Everyone in management has ‘come up from the trenches’ and really views crunch as a problem. When it happens we usually have a meeting about why, and try to manage scope and schedule to keep it minimal. This gives me hope that the industry can do it better, but seeing my friends at other studios makes me keenly aware that its a rare thing that I have instead of the industry standard.”Right now, this change in management approach is reliant on the entrepreneurial spirit of a few forward-thinking studio heads. To negotiate an industrywide change in labour conditions, workers are increasingly looking to collective organisation. The IGDA’s 2014 survey reveals 56% of respondents want unionisation: whether or not the organisation wishes to serve in that role, its constituency is clearly ready for more direct action.Nowhere is this more apparent than in Montreal, an important centre for game development with major Ubisoft, Square Enix and Warner Bros studios in residence. Here, there are now regular and very passionate meetings about the viability of unions and worker co-operatives – they could represent a vital first step in an industry without much history of labour organisation.As for the studios mentioned in this article, we approached all of them via email offering a chance to answer the criticisms and observations of their staff members. Only one replied: Electronic Arts.“New technologies and processes being implemented by our studio and QA teams are not only improving game quality but also reducing the time strains on game development,” wrote a spokesperson.“As is the case with any type of software development, there are rare periods of time where an individual or team will put in additional time to reach an important milestone, such as launching a public beta or the final development stages of a game. EA does not enforce additional hours and employees are in control of what time they work. If extra hours are spent during one of these stages, we always look to give employees additional time off or other compensation. Our teams want to deliver the best possible experience to players, and we appreciate everyone’s commitment, especially during the busiest times.“Over the past 18 months, EA has been making significant investments in new quality assurance tools and automation technology, implementing ongoing testing right from the beginning of game conceptualisation. These changes are ultimately improving game quality, as well as reducing the need for the crunch periods.”Crunch is less of a problem than it was in 2004, but it remains an intrinsic part of development culture. Better management, increased worker organisation and a more diverse staff base may well be the way out; but this being the games industry, it won’t happen without a fight.
Apple has been awarded a patent for a head-mounted display device, which uses an inserted iPhone for a screen in a manner similar to Samsung’s Gear VR or Google’s Cardboard project.The patent,filed in September 2008but only granted this week, shows a chunky set of glasses with a slot for a mobile phone, as well as built-in earphones and a wireless remote control the user can hold in their hand while plugged in to the system.Such a system avoids the “inconvenient and cumbersome” alternative of connecting a headset to a PC by wires, the patent declares.But the patent doesn’t necessarily mean the company is seeking to create a virtual reality device. Apple regularly seeks protection for ideas which it has little intention of bringing to market, and a glance over the history of the company’s published patents reveals many such ideas,from an infrared camera system for iPhonestodisplays with audio sensors built-in.It’s not even the first patent for a head-mounted display granted to Apple,which patented a different sort of system, looking more similar to an Oculus Rift, in 2014.But despite the opposition of chief designer Jony Ive to smartglasses – in a recent interview with the New Yorkerhe said he felt the face “was the wrong place”for a device, when compared to the wrist – it appears the company may be taking a serious look at the field.Related:Apple's Jony Ive digested: 23 things we've learnedThe granting of the patent follows a spate of job adverts showing that the company is seeking to hire developers with expertise in developing VR apps. Some adverts called for engineers to “create high performance apps that integrate with virtual reality systems for prototyping and user testing”, while others looked for developers with experience with the Oculus Rift VR headset to create “state of the art physics-based world simulation, visuals and virtual reality”.
The official site of TV chef Jamie Oliver, which sees an average of 10m visits per month, has been compromised by hackers serving malicious files to visitors which could take control of their computers.JamieOliver.com, which is ranked number 538 in the UK according to analytics firm Alexa, was hacked into by criminals, either through a compromised plugin used by Oliver’s site or through stolen login details for the site.The attack was spotted by security firm Malware Bytes, which alerted Oliver’s site operators. The site appears to have since been cleaned of the malicious files.Visitors were shown another website embedded directly into the site, which attacked their computers through bugs in Flash, Microsoft’s Silverlight and Java.If successful, the attackers then installed malware on to the users’ computers, leading to the installation of more malicious software.The attackers could then use the computer to launch further attacks as part of a botnet, steal data and send spam, among other uses. It is not known how many users fell victim to the attacks.Related:Jamie Oliver's FoodTube: why he's taking the food revolution online“It all started with a compromised JavaScript hosted on jamieoliver.com.

More than two thirds of crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter are still manually reviewed by a human before they launch, the company has announced.This, despite the fact that since June 2014, Kickstarter’s initial reviews have been automated, with an algorithm checking every new project submitted to its site.The company says that of 69,015 submissions since then, 27,897 were approved by the algorithm to launch immediately, although 6,265 of those creators took up the option of having a Kickstarter employee check their project anyway.Related:Kickstarter crowdfunding in 2014: $529m of pledges from 3.3m backersThat means that 31% of projects submitted since June have launched without a human reviewer, 9% asked for a manual check, and a further 60% were marked for human review by the algorithm.Why publish these statistics? Kickstarter is keen to stress that more automation in its review process isn’t a green light for scammers and over-ambitious projects that may struggle to deliver on their promises.“This new process is a big improvement in three important ways: it creates a fast track for projects that have historically been simple approvals; it makes our team even more available to creators who want additional support; and it gives us more time to make informed decisions about the projects we need to review,”explained the company’s blog post.“Why do we put so much attention into reviewing projects? Because it’s our job to make sure we’re fostering a healthy community – one where everybody’s clear on how things work, people can trust one another, and projects of all shapes and sizes can succeed.”Kickstarter is the most high-profile crowdfunding site,attracting $529m (£347m) of pledges from 3.3 million peoplein 2014 alone, Since its launch in 2009, the site has driven more than $1.5bn of pledges, and nearly 79,000 successfully funded projects.Its blog post comes at a time when Kickstarter, and crowdfunding more generally, is under as much scrutiny as ever regarding the model’s failures as well as its success stories.Kickstarter-funded game Godus, for example, is the subject of media attention after backers complained that several of its promises remained unfulfilled.Designer Peter Molyneux has been running the gauntletof a series of interviews questioning his approach.Related:Kickstarter: how crowdfunding is booming in Britain“If I was pledging on this campaign I’d probably be saying the same thing as our backers.

In 1980, Pac-Man introduced a classic game mechanic. The quick shifts between gobbling up dots while being chased by ghosts, and swallowing a Power Pill to turn the tables and eat them, allowed players to continuously transform between hunted and hunter. Almost 35 years later Evolve pits one player against four, and stakes everything on that same rhythm.Developed over five years by Turtle Rock Studios, the team behind the superb co-op shooter Left 4 Dead, Evolve is a system designer’s dream. Asymmetric shooters, where individual players have different capabilities, are nothing new – but Evolve takes the concept to a different place. It casts one player as a hulking monster, capable of ‘evolving’ into more powerful forms over time, and four other players as human hunters tasked with bringing it down.On both sides Evolve is a different beast. The monster is controlled from a third-person perspective, with four special attacks and different movement options. Your goal is to avoid the hunters at first while devouring the wildlife – which both builds up armour and takes you closer to the next stage of mutation. At stage one the monster is comparatively underpowered, so the hunters have an edge. At stage two the monster gets bigger and things get more even, while if it reaches stage three it suddenly has the power and size to smash individual hunters in seconds.Becoming a monsterEvolve’s main Hunt gametype works beautifully when playing as the monster. Matches begin at the spot where the hunters will shortly arrive, so the first minutes are spent trying to get as far away as possible – sneaking will slow you down, but leaves no footprints, while hauling over large distances at speed can also be effective. In this opening period being found by the hunters is a disaster, which makes settling down to feed enormously tense, and smart monsters focus on feints and distractions (like misleading footprints) to buy as much time as possible. As soon as it hits stage two the monster can begin fighting back.And how. From a monster’s perspective the hunters are ants – but irritatingly fast, capable of quick dodges, and forever peppering your carapace with small arms fire. The size advantage is such that getting any single hunter isolated and trapped is a nearly guaranteed kill but, by juggling temporary shields and using traps, the hunters can also impede the monster’s movement. The key to a hunting team’s success is co-ordinating their abilities well, and so the most important thing as a monster is disrupting this – take out the medic, for example, and even the most foolhardy team will think twice.Reading the environment is key to success: monsters need to cover their tracks while searching for food, hunters need to track footprints and carcassesPhotograph: 2K GamesSuch tactics might get the monster to stage three, at which point its powers are such that hunters need to perform flawlessly and pray. The scales tip, and as the monster you switch from running to chasing. This role in Evolve is the most purely competitive, because in setting one player against four it ensures that the feeling of victory is multiplied – winning against a human opponent is a great feeling, and it turns out this effect stacks. However, it is also devastating to be swarmed by these Lilliputians, trapped in corners, and how humiliating if brought to ground!The art of huntingSuch duality runs through Evolve – what works for one side twists into an equally great consequence for the other. As a hunter Evolve is played from a first-person perspective: this emphasises the scale of the environments and the monster, and makes the impact of combat much more obvious, decreasing the total view you have over these epic battles.When a match begins, hunters immediately start chasing down leads – looking for tracks, or carcasses, or birds startled by a large thing moving nearby. Each hunter has a jetpack that can be used for both close-range dodges and, when navigating, gorgeously lazy boosts into the air to zoom forwards. All players control a different class: assault, which deals damage and tanks; trapper, which can spring a giant containment dome and other surprises; support, which protects the team and weakens the monster; and medic, which keeps the team alive.The human hunters must cooperate to survivePhotograph: 2K GamesFighting against a monster is impossible solo, or even in small groups – all four must co-ordinate their abilities. The trapper’s job is to ‘catch’ the monster in a temporary containment field, the medic will be healing whatever damage the monster’s dishing out. Any decent monster player immediately zeroes in on one of these two classes, hoping to decisively turn the battle, and it’s the job of support to shield them, and assault to become an unbearable distraction in the meantime.Work together and it can be beautiful. The monster uses all of its abilities crashing into a medic who has just been shielded by support, and turns around into three harpoon traps. While it flails, an artillery strike is called in on that position, and mines are placed. It then runs out into a hail of fire from the assault player as the medic covers the monster’s back in ‘weak spots’ from her sniper rifle.These fights – no, battles – are always a war of attrition. As the monster it is devastating to feel the momentum slipping from your claws. As the hunters, the moment when a previously cocky monster starts trying to run is exhilarating. There are many more specifics to Evolve’s interplay, but everything serves a purpose – and the skill in balancing not just the opposing teams but the overall rhythm should not be underestimated. Despite all the plates it is spinning, Evolve works beautifully.A flawed menagerieThere are some fairly sizeable caveats to the overall game, however, and most are consequences of just how well-engineered the core is. There are three monsters in Evolve, and the default is Goliath. Goliath is fantastic to control – he’s brawny, fast, and you can feel the impact as his moves smash teams apart. The second, Kraken, has an interesting moveset but it’s a little more divorced from the action – you end up floating around a lot and aiming lightning strikes and mines at the hunters. Fighting against Kraken as the hunters feel great, but playing as Kraken lacks the immediacy of Goliath.The third monster, Wraith, is another mixed bag. The Wraith is a stealth-based assassin monster, all creepy body and giant claws, but the problem is that by default the monsters are pretty good at hiding. So when you add extra stealth options, what it means is that hunting a Wraith is more like waiting 15 minutes for it to reach stage three, then kill you. It may be that the teams I’ve played with aren’t efficient enough trackers. But both it and Kraken feel like less enjoyable choices.This hints at Evolve’s real problem: the core of the game is great, but the ways it has been extended don’t quite live up to it. The Nest mode, for example, places six eggs around the map, which the Hunters have to destroy while the monster races to both evolve itself and protect them. In theory this might operate as a territory-style objective mode, but in practice the monster player sacrifices the first eggs to fatten up as much as possible, before attacking. The actual confrontation is still great, but the first ten minutes or so of each match feels like dead time.This gives Evolve an unusual problem. The core Hunt mode is brilliant, but the nature of matchmaking means that the weaker modes do end up accounting for significant playtime. On top of this you have to grind with the starting characters to unlock others, a structure intended to make the game more ‘sticky’ but here acting as little more than artificial gates with pointless rewards – a 2% increase in flamethrower range does not excite on any level. Such stuff means that Evolve feels more diluted than it should, bulked-out rather than enhanced. Turtle Rock did such a good job creating an original foundation, you wonder why it settled for such standard structural elements. Which leads us to Evolve’s problem with downloadable content.The DLC dilemmaYou could not seriously argue the Evolve disc is lacking in value-for-money. The 12 maps, 12 hunters, and 3 monsters easily shift this beyond my personal £1-per-hour rule-of-thumb for a multiplayer experience. The biggest problem is that publisher 2K made some bad short-term decisions; Evolve has a fourth monster, the Behemoth, but only for players who pre-ordered or pay extra to buy it at launch. This seems a pointless way of punishing the non-obsessives (i.e. most of us) and isolating a piece of content that, given its Goliath-centred appeal, the vanilla game could sorely use.The Wraith monster is interesting but battling it lacks the fun of the GoliathPhotograph: 2K GamesDespite this, Evolve stands tall, an original and often brilliant take on both team-based and solo multiplayer. The main Hunt gametype is an exceptional experience that, although featuring some familiar mechanics, feels unlike anything else in the genre. The matches have huge diversity, and all create some thrilling rhythm from the mix of hunting and chasing and fighting.With the ability to play as a monster against a human team, Evolve offers something unique – and surely one of gaming’s best-ever tribute acts. When you’re fleeing from the hunters and get trapped in their containment field, swatting desperately while looking for an out, you think back to those Power Pills and how far we’ve come. But then you get a lucky shot on the medic, take out the trapper as she goes for the revive, and as you turn, the last two hunters start to run. They’re screwed. Why talk about great design, when you canfeelit.2K Games/ PC, PS4, Xbox One (version tested) / £40 / Pegi rating: 16+
Google may have gone back to the drawing board for a rethink of its Glass smart eyewear, but rivals are pressing on with their plans – including Sony, which has made its SmartEyeglass gadget available to pre-order in the UK and Germany.Described as a “developer edition”, the SED-E1 eyewear will cost £620 when it goes on sale in March, at which point it will also be available in eight other countries. However, a version for non-developers won’t go on sale until 2016 at the earliest.Sony is keen for developers to get their hands on (or, rather, eyeballs in) the glasses so they can start developing apps. The pre-order announcement was accompanied by the launch of asoftware development kit for SmartEyeglass, and acompanion app released through Android’s Google Play store.Sony’s device works differently to Google’s. Instead of a tiny display built into the frame of the glasses, it displays information across its “augmented reality lenses”, while promising not to obscure the wearer’s vision.The SmartEyeglass includes motion and brightness sensors, a microphone and a three-megapixel camera. It ships with a handheld controller that connects to the glasses via cable, and it will also pair wirelessly with smartphones.Sony’s claimed battery life of around 150 minutes when not using the camera or 80 minutes when using it shows the early nature of the product, as does the controller cable and the somewhat functional design.The company appears to be in two minds about the likeliest target market for the SmartEyeglass. When the device wasshown at the CES in January, the focus seemed to be professional uses, from warehouses and factories to medical and firefighting scenarios.Related:Google Glass can return – but it must clear four big hurdles firstIn itsblog post announcing the pre-orders, though, Sony notes that when the device launches in March, there will be apps for consumer uses including Twitter, Facebook and Gmail. TheSmartEyeglass product pagealso highlights sports viewing and tourism as potential uses.SmartEyeglass isn’t Sony’s only product in the smart eyewear category. Also at CES, the companytalked about its plans for an “attachable single-lens display module”designed to clip on to various non-smart glasses, with plans to start mass-producing them within a year.Sony’s push into the smart eyewear market comes shortly afterGoogle stopped producing Google Glass in its present form, moving its team out of the Google X incubator labs to become a separate division within the company. Google has since described the move asa chance for the Glass team to “reset” its strategy.

A year after buying virtual reality trailblazer Oculus, Facebook has confirmed that it’s making its own VR apps.However, the company doesn’t just want its users to consume VR content. It wants it to be as easy to make virtual realities as it is to upload a photo or a video, so that anyone can do it – whether that’s a typical user, or even superstars like Beyoncé.With some understatement,Facebook’s chief product officer Chris Cox told the Code/Media conferencethat “virtual reality is pretty cool”.“We’re working on apps for VR,” he said, citing as inspirations existing experiences such as flying a fighter jet, or sitting in a Mongolian yurt.“You realize, when you’re in it, that you’re looking at the future, and it’s going to be awesome. When you’re in Facebook, you’re just sending around these bits of experience – a photo, a video, a thought,” Cox said.In contrast, VR is about “sending a fuller picture … You’ll do it, Beyoncé will do it.”Related:Samsung creates drone, robotics and virtual reality labFacebook’s desire for premium content to deliver over virtual worlds was explained by Palmer Luckey, the ​chief executive and co-founder of Oculus,at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “We’re trying to predict where it’s going with the hardware as it is now – and it’s very hard,” Luckey said.“Looking at a larger than life News Feed or someone’s photos in VR isn’t interesting. It needs to be new experience. I don’t think it’s going to be Facebook the social network in VR, but people are narcissists and they want people to see what they think are their amazing lives.”Of course, Facebook has a while longer to tackle the questions. As Cox admitted, “we’re probably a long way from everyone having these headsets”.Related:Facebook still suspending Native Americans over 'real name' policy
Apple has quietly unleashed a number of changes to the wayit reviews appssubmitted to its app store, strengthening its application of some rules, allowing exemptions for others, and rewriting another completely.The changes will particularly affect game developers, who have been given greater freedom to make expansive high-quality games while seeing their ability to effectively market them curtailed.But the changes may, however, not calm the fears of developers who have long worried that the company’s app review process rests ultimately on capricious reviewers making inconsistent determinations of what is and isn’t allowed, a fact which is “burning a lot of developer motivation”according to one iOS coder.Guns removed from advertsA longstanding rule (Rule 3.6) of the App Store tells developers that, regardless of the age rating of the app they are creating (which can be anything up to 17+), “Apps with app icons, screenshots, and previews that do not adhere to the 4+ age rating will be rejected”.Apps in the 4+ category must contain “no objectionable material”. Given even “mild or infrequent occurrences of cartoon, fantasy, or realistic violence” are hived off to the 9+ category, it’s a tight limit on what can be depicted in the advertising material for any given app, but one which was until now sparsely applied.However, game developers for iOS have reported the company has started to apply the rule in a new context: apps are being rejected for having icons or screenshots that depict guns.Related:Are freemium games focusing too much on monetisation and not enough on fun?Pocket Gamer reportsthat titles including Gang Nations, Bullet Rush, and Apple ​Editor’s Choice​-winning Tempo have all been asked to alter their marketing materials to remove or pixelate guns. Even Rooster Teeth vs Zombiens, a game which features the hero holding a gun-shaped accessory for the Nintendo ​entertainment ​system, had to change its icon so he was instead holding a baseball bat.Apple’s app store rules do warn developers that “this is a living document, and new ​apps presenting new questions may result in new rules at any time. Perhaps your ​app will trigger this.” But the company declined to comment on the new applications of longstanding rules to games which seemingly pose no new questions at all.Marijuana allowed on the iPhoneAnother set of reconsidered rules do seem to be prompted by a change in situation. Apple has long banned any app to do with real-world drug use,citing guideline 2.18: “Apps that encourage excessive consumption of alcohol or illegal substances, or encourage minors to consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes, will be rejected”.But as legalisation and decriminalisation of marijuana has swept the United States, apps pertaining to consumption of the drug don’t immediately seem to fit into any of those categories. It’s not alcohol, nor is it illegal, and it appears Apple agrees that the time has come to lift restrictions on it.The first beneficiary of the policy is Massroots, a social networking app for stoners. It had initially been pulled from the app store, but was reinstated after the developers agreed to limit membership to only those users who are in one of the 23 American states where marijuana is legal (in the majority of those, only for medicinal use).The app’s developers confirmedthey would be abiding by the new rules. “We do not take this task lightly. Over the coming weeks, we will be implementing new features to strengthen our compliance even beyond what is currently required.”Related:Apple approves Kim Jong-un spoof Little Dictator after initial rejectionLarger appsOne change has been explicitly announced by Apple. “The size limit of an app package submitted through iTunes Connect has increased from 2 GB to 4 GB,” the company confirmed to developers, “so you can include more media in your submission and provide a more complete, rich user experience upon installation”.​Although the update doesn’t affect the size of apps which can be downloaded over a mobile network​ – still capped at 100MB, in one of Apple’s last concessions to the bandwidth demands of carriers ​– it allows for apps downloaded over ​Wi-​Fi to be twice as large as they were before.The rules update will mainly affect games, the most upmarket of which were already pushing hard against the 2GB limit (for instance, XCOM: Enemy Within takes up 1.96GB of space). A 3D game with textures high-resolution enough to appear on a retina iPad screen will find the extra space gets burned through quickly.But not everyone will be happy. With Apple still selling 16GB iPhones, some users may well find that just one or two of these behemoth apps are all they can store on their devices if they want to use them as normal.
Artificial intelligence and nanotechnology have been named alongside nuclear war, ecological catastrophe and super-volcano eruptions as “risks that threaten human civilisation” in areport by the Global Challenges Foundation.In the case of AI, the report suggests that future machines and software with “human-level intelligence” could create new, dangerous challenges for humanity – although they could also help to combat many of the other risks cited in the report.“Such extreme intelligences could not easily be controlled (either by the groups creating them, or by some international regulatory regime), and would probably act to boost their own intelligence and acquire maximal resources for almost all initial AI motivations,” suggest authors Dennis Pamlin and Stuart Armstrong.Related:Artificial intelligence: can scientists stop ‘negative’ outcomes?“And if these motivations do not detail the survival and value of humanity, the intelligence will be driven to construct a world without humans. This makes extremely intelligent AIs a unique risk, in that extinction is more likely than lesser impacts.”The report also warns of the risk that “economic collapse may follow from mass unemployment as humans are replaced by copyable human capital”, and expresses concern at the prospect of AI being used for warfare: “An AI arms race could result in AIs being constructed with pernicious goals or lack of safety precautions.”In the case of nanotechnology, the report notes that “atomically precise manufacturing” could have a range of benefits for humans. It could help to tackle challenges including depletion of natural resources, pollution and climate change. But it foresees risks too.“It could create new products – such as smart or extremely resilient materials – and would allow many different groups or even individuals to manufacture a wide range of things,” suggests the report. “This could lead to the easy construction of large arsenals of conventional or more novel weapons made possible by atomically precise manufacturing.”The foundation was set up in 2011 with the aim of funding research into risks that could threaten humanity, and encouraging more collaboration between governments, scientists and companies to combat them.That is why its report presents worst-case scenarios for its 12 chosen risks, albeit alongside suggestions for avoiding them and acknowledgements of the positive potential for the technologies involved.In the case of artificial intelligence, though, Global Challenges Foundation’s report is part of a wider debate about possible risks as AI gets more powerful in the future.In January,former Microsoft boss Bill Gates saidthat he is “in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence”, even if in the short term, machines doing more jobs for humans should be a positive trend if managed well.Related:Rise of the robots: how long do we have until they take our jobs?“A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don’t understand why some people are not concerned.”Tesla and SpaceX boss Musk had spoken out in October 2014, suggesting that “we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that”.Professor Stephen Hawking is another worrier,saying in Decemberthat “the primitive forms of artificial intelligence we already have, have proved very useful. But I think the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.”The full list of “risks that threaten human civilisation, according to Global Challenges Foundation:Extreme climate changeNuclear warGlobal pandemicEcological catastropheGlobal system collapseMajor asteroid impactSuper-volcanoSynthetic biologyNanotechnologyArtificial intelligenceUnknown consequencesFuture bad global governance
Google’s latest doodle celebrates the birthday of Alessandro Volta, who invented an early form of the electric battery in 1799. Volta’s invention consisted of discs of different metals, including copper and zinc, separated by cardboard that had been soaked in brine.Born in 1745 in the town of Como in what is now northern Italy, Volta was the son of a nobleman. He became a professor of physics in 1774 at Como’s Royal School before going on to work on the development of the “electrophorus”, a device that produced static electricity.Related:Alessandro Volta: inventor of the electrical pile | Charlotte ConnellyHis voltaic pile, an early electric battery that produced a steady current, was developed in 1800 at a time when competing theories existed about how electricity was generated. One theory, popularised by Luigi Galvani, was that there was a special electricity in animals, which he demonstrated by connecting two different metals with a frog’s leg.Volta came to the conclusion that it was the liquid in the frog’s leg that was important rather than the frog itself. The same effect was achieved after he replaced the leg with paper soaked in brine.After being made a count in 1810 by Napoleon Bonaparte, Volta retired in 1819 to his estate in Camnago, where he died in 1827.
Mario Costeja Gonzálezspent five years fighting to have 18 words delisted from Google search results on his name.When the Spaniard googled himself in 2009, two prominent results appeared: home-foreclosure notices from 1998, when he was in temporary financial trouble. Thenoticeshad been published in Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia and recently digitised. But their original purpose – attracting buyers to auction – had lapsed a decade ago, as had the debt. Costeja González asked the newspaper to remove them. When that was unsuccessful, he challenged Google, and the case was eventually elevated to the European Court of Justice, Europe’s highest court.Forgetting and remembering are complex, messy, human processes. Our minds reconstruct, layer, contextualise and sediment. The worldwide web is different. As Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page described in theiroriginal Stanford research paper, the web is “a vast collection of completely uncontrolled heterogeneous documents”.And search engines take that corpus and give it perpetual, decontextualised freshness. Vast catalogues of human sentiments and stories get served up at the mercurial whims ofblack boxalgorithms – algorithms that Brin and Page initially described as “inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers”, in a way that is “difficult even for experts to evaluate” and therefore is “particularly insidious”.The crude, timeless nature of digital memory – and the unquestionedpowerof private, commercially motivated companies that control it – was a challenge that 59-year-old Costeja González decided to tackle directly.Philosophical divideIn May 2014, the ECJ found against Google. It recognised that when we enter someone’s name as a search query, scattered moments of their life are presented mechanistically, with a significance distorted by lack of context, building a detailed but selective profile. So what are the rights of the individuals to whom those profiles relate? And what are the rights of those seeking information?The question produces an interesting philosophical divide. One position is that once online, information should stay online (except when unlawful under defamation, copyright, or criminal law). This is generally the starting point of most US internet companies, free speech organisations and the media; a typical view for those raised on US First Amendment thought.On the other hand, there are all manner of reasons to remove data, other than being compelled by law. One might want to remove information for emotional reasons, ethical reasons, or “just because”, when there is no countervailing interest. Some recent removal requests approved by Google included patient medical histories; intimate private photos; and old threads in private group conversations that ended up online.They include prominent reminders that an individual was the victim of rape, assault or other criminal acts; that they were once an incidental witness to tragedy; that those close to them – a partner or child – were murdered. The original sources are often many years or decades old. They are static, unrepresentative reminders of lives past, lacking the dynamic of reality.In the real world, information sediments over time, affording people the capacity to move on, remembering but not being burdened by their past. Offline, we communicate in different ways with different “publics” and purposes.And this was the view of the court in Luxembourg, which drew its justification from EU data protection law. The court ruled that personal data should be removed from search results on a person’s name when outdated, inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant, or devoid of purpose, and when there is no public interest.‘Right to be forgotten’A public interest demands that relevant information remains accessible, which is why pertinent information about elected politicians, public officials, professionals and criminals – and even just bad reviews – all rightly remain accessible, hence Google rejecting such requests. Importantly, nothing in the ruling suggested that source material should be deleted: it was solely about the prominence of information in search engine results.Related:Right to be forgotten poses more questions than answersThe phrase “right to be forgotten” was mentioned only briefly in the judgment but was immediately seized upon by the media, Google and regulators. Though now replaced by the more accurate “right to delist”, the impact of the label “right to be forgotten” was to force the debate into binaries: forgetting vs remembering, privacy vs freedom of expression, censorship vs truth or history. These are false dichotomies, insufficiently nuanced to cope with the reality of our lives and the complexities of human existence.The point of having rights against search engines is not to manipulate memory or eliminate information, but to make it less prominent, where justified, and combat the side-effects of this uniquely modern phenomenon that information is instantly, globally, and perpetually accessible.Since when has the internet become “truth”, or “memory”? And since when has “history” been reduced to Google’s commercially prioritised list of an imperfect collection of digital traces? Such elisions ignore the nuance of forgiveness and understanding, in conjunction with memory itself, in building truth and justice. They undervalue privacy and autonomy, at the price of near-total transparency, in building community and security.The all-or-nothing framings imposed on this case constrain, influence and shape the narrative of a much broader war: the struggle for our digital identities. We have reached a critical moment. Control over our personal data has been all but lost online: lost to corporations, to governments; lost to each other. How can we, as individuals, be empowered by the huge benefits of digital connectivity and global information flows, yet still retain some personal control over the way our identities are represented and traded online? Costeja González’s case is a small but critical battle on that broader terrain.Mario Costeja González, the Spaniard who challenged Google for the ‘right to be forgotten’.Photograph: Cabalar/EPANine months after the European ruling, it is clear that Google’s implementation has been fast, idiosyncratic, and allowed the company to shape interpretation to its own ends, as well as to gain an advantage on competitors and regulators forced into reactive mode. It avoided a broader and much deeper reflection on digital public space, information sedimentation, and the exploration of collaborative solutions between public and private actors – such as a joint request service across different search engines, with processes for getting confidential advice from publishers and public officials.Veneer of authenticityA little more than two weeks after the ruling, Google launched an online form for citizens to identify search result links about themselves that are “irrelevant, outdated or otherwise objectionable” – only a partial reading of the governing law, which also includes “incorrect, inadequate or misleading”. It started to remove links one month later. At the time of writing, the company had received 218,427 requests, comprising a total of 789,496 links. It has reached a decision on 83% of the links and actually removed 264,450 of them, or 34%. Yet all this has been done without disclosing its internal processes, removal criteria or how it is prioritising cases.Google established an impressive”advisory council” of formidable experts, insulating its processes with a veneer of authenticity and respectability – despite being excluded from any actual knowledge of what Google is doing internally because it has revealed so few details of the cases it is processing. Created to compete with democratically legitimate expert regulatory bodies, the council’s work culminated in the “independent” report released in February 2015, setting out its recommendations based on seven recent consultations across Europe.When the ECJ announced its ruling, Googlecriticisedit as “disappointing”, “striking the wrong balance” and “going too far”. Yet despite highlighting the “many open questions” of the ruling, Google chose not to wait for guidance from the regulators, which emerged eventually in late November (and which Google has since ignored). It has taken every opportunity to passively promote its role as a “truth” engine while avoiding discussion on the deficiencies of search: algorithmic bias, incomplete coverage, murky reputation management practices and heavy cultural-bias.Most controversially, Google’s interpretation is that successful requests are removed only under European Google domains such as google.fr, google.uk and google.de. In contrast, requests alleging copyright infringement - which outnumber privacy requests by 1000:1 - are implemented under US law on all its domains worldwide, including the largest, google.com.Tactical decisionGoogle’s decision to only remove links on its European domains was “unacceptable” and creates a trivial workaround to undermine the ruling, according to the November report by regulators from 28 European countries and the European Commission. But, backed by its advisory council, Google’s decision was tactical, shifting discussion away from the core issue of establishing and protecting digital rights, and instead encouraging conflict between apparent European and US viewpoints.Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt.Photograph: Murdo MacleodA line repeatedly used by executive chairman Eric Schmidt and chief legal counsel David Drummond is that Google has always seen itself as a “card index” for the web – an oddly archaic analogy that implies objectivity, memory and public record. Yet Google can and does curate its search results, including material it judges to be promoting terrorism or child abuse.Google refuses to countenance the possibility of an algorithmic flaw, yet the question remains why Costeja’s old debts – and the private, incorrect or outdated information of others who have made requests to Google since – were featured so prominently in search results.While Google previously removed personal information in limited cases of clear and imminent harm, such as identity theft or financial fraud, this case represents the first generally accessible speed-bump on what has been an open road for Google to aggregate and proliferate publicly accessible personal information.The right to delist forces us to look at the privatised reality of digital life, and take responsibility for what we see. Internet companies have been successful in making us believe that the internet is “public space”, when, in reality, it is just an algebraic representation of privately owned services. Not public parks, or the Greek agora to build politics, but a long run of amusement parks. The notion of public space is fundamental to democratic, community-orientated rule.Asymmetries of powerSo, if we concede that the internet is public space, that the web is the public record, then Google, on its logic, is the custodian and indexer of our personal records. We must be careful todistinguishthe offerings of a handful of internet services from the real public record guaranteed by law, from archives, and even from human memory itself – which will all continue to be available when the amusement park closes.Citizens have unwittingly come to comprehensivelyrelyon privately owned, culturally biased,black-boxservices in navigating the digital ecosystem. Google has benefited vastly from this custom, creating enormous asymmetries of power when compared to the creators, subjects and consumers of digital content.The selective information flowing from Google’s sophisticated PR machine has seen little pushback from publishers. After the web-form for requests was introduced, the press wastoldof tens of thousands of requests, and that many of them concerned criminals, paedophiles, dodgy doctors, and politicians.The first removal was made public not by Google, with a clear breakdown of what was being delisted and why, but by prominent journalists reacting to alarming emails sent to their webmasters headed “Notice of removal from Google search”.By selectively covering the most sensational removal requests, the media created the false impression that most seeking delisting are “bad people”. The concern that they might be allowed to cover their tracks is understandable, but the broader implication is dangerously misleading.Regulators need to take a more active and central role in these kind of legal and ethical debates, but have struggled to keep pace with technology. Most of Europe’s 31 national data protection authorities are cumbersome, under-resourced bureaucracies issuing occasional, random fines and reacting when a court occasionally clarifies the law. Europe’s data protection laws need to be deconstructed, simplified, and rebuilt into more workable form. Nevertheless, their aspirations are critically important.Google has become the custodian and indexer of our personal records.Photograph: Christian Hartmann/ReutersThe same regulators should be encouraging a more nuanced and transparent discussion with Google and other search engines, confronting complex issues such as how the ruling sits alongside laws on processing sensitive data, the role of the media and of sources. Yet regulators have been far too inactive, tolerating misrepresentation of removal requests by the press and failing to insist on greater transparency, both of which have undermined the protection of individuals’ data.Nuance, empathy and respectPublishers, too, have a case to answer. Was La Vanguardia entirely in the right to republish its entire archive, or was it careless? Balancing transparency and the protection of the individual, publishers should consider tailored responses: removing the article at source or pseudonymising the subject; removing data from the search engine; geo-filtering; a right to reply, or updated contextual information.We need more sophisticated technical processes to improve how personal data is handled, flagging data as sensitive so that search engines and data processors apply data protection principles in a more intelligent way – with the nuance, empathy and respect individuals command in real life.As information security expertDan Geer characterised it, the right to delist is “the only check on the tidal wave of observability that a ubiquitous sensor fabric is birthing now, observability that changes the very quality of what ‘in public’ means”.This struggle for freedom, autonomy and control is unfolding within a digital ecosystemdefined bysurveillance. We are already a long way along the path of a parasitic system, offering ‘free’ services in return for the exploitation of personal data. But this should not mean that we throw up our hands in despair, abandoning responsibility for digital identity, the permanent circulation of personal data beyond all control.Blunt, binary logic might work for machines, but it doesn’t work for humans. Our right, and our basic human need, to disclose, seek, find, transform, and distribute information must be reconciled with our equal right and need to be left alone. We have a right to decide to withhold, to remain silent, to resist. This is what is at stake here: our own rightful sovereignty over our life stories, our personal narratives, our communications and even our very memories themselves.Julia Powlesis a researcher in law and technology at the University of Cambridge, and contributed evidence to the Google Advisory Council.Enrique Chaparrois an information security specialist and president of Fundación Vía Libre, an Argentine digital rights organisation
Recently, several non-techy friends have sidled up to me and asked, in hushed conspiratorial tones: “Keith, should I be playing video games?”It’s an interesting question for two reasons. First, I write about video games for a living; that’s my job. So what did theythinkI was going to say? “No, they’re a massive waste of time”? Secondly, a few years ago, people my age were feeling guilty about playing video games, now there are people feeling guilty that they’re not. This is progress.So for all the potential gamers out there who are thinking about taking up a joypad but don’t know where to start, or which games to try, or what a joypad looks like, here is a quick guide:So should you play video games?Yes! The medium has matured hugely over the last five years, and there is a vast range of experiences available, from big blockbusting open-world adventures about marauding gangsters, to teeny, highly personal indie games about coming out. Games are respected enough for Bafta to accept them into its remit, enough for Moma to put a range of titles into its permanent collection, and enough for major art spaces like the Barbican and the Grand Palais museum in Paris to run exhibitions.Games have been shown to improvehand-eye coordination,cognitive flexibility,decision making, evenvision. Despite popular stereotypes, games are sociable and inclusive, with large, supportive communities andsomebrilliantevents. Basically, if you’re happy to watch TV for three hours a day or continually peruse celebrity gossip websites and social media streams, you cannot – with any degree of self-awareness – call video games a waste of time.Not wasting his life … Avid gamer Snoop Dogg.Photograph: UPI / Landov / Barcroft MediaWhat you need to play video gamesSmartphone/tabletIf you already have a smartphone or tablet, then great, you’ve got a games machine. The latest Apple, Android and Windows handsets feature powerful processors, large displays and vast app stores crammed with games (you’ll have more choice if your phone is the latest model and your operating system is up to date). If you’re looking for a new handset, the latest iPhone and Android models are the best (Windows is not so well supported by game developers): the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Sony Xperia Z3 and LG G3 are all great options for gaming. Budget models like the Motorola Moto G and older iPhone models are fine for less demanding ‘casual’ titles.PCIf you’re looking for the most advanced gaming experience with the best visuals, you’ll need to buy a PC (you can play games on Apple Macs too, but there are fewer titles available – unless you dual-boot, but we arenotgoing there). Running the latest big budget action games at the absolute peak of their abilities – and ensuring you can do so for two or three more years – will require something in the region of an Intel i7 4790 processor, an Nvidia GTX 980 graphics card and perhaps 16GB of system memory (though 8GB is currently fine for games). It would be best to have a newish Windows install too, although plenty of games support the open source alternative, Linux.However, you don’t have to spend big on a top-of-the-range mega beast: if you’re happy to turn some of the graphics settings down, £500-600 will get you a decent machine with an Intel i5 processor, AMD R9 280 graphics card and 8GB of memory. Even an old laptop with Windows XP and 512MB of ram will let you play a variety of smaller indie games and older titles. Classic point-and-click adventures, strategy titles and vintage shooters are cheap and easily available online (Good Old Gameshas hundreds of them), and don’t require state-of-the-art hardware.If your eyes glazed over at all that talk of processors and graphics cards, that’s fine: go to a good PC seller likePCSpecialist,OverclockersorChillblast, give them your budget and let them build a system that fits it. Youwillneed to develop some knowledge of computers and operating systems, though, especially if you plan to upgrade your graphics card or memory at some point. We havean article on building a gaming PC– it’s a little dated on the specifics but still sound on the types of things you have to think about.ConsoleJust about edging it … Playstation 4.Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty ImagesFor most people, a console is a good alternative to the PC. They’re cheaper, they’re ready to play right out of the box, and you don’t have to worry about lots of hardware compatibility issues and graphics settings. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are the latest models (both retailing at around £350), and technically they’re extremely similar. At the moment, the PS4 is selling better and developers seem to be getting more out of it in terms of graphics performance, but it’s close – and you should check which one your friends have, just in case you want to play online with them.Alternatively, you could buy a Wii U (cheap and interesting with three or four amazing titles that are great for families) or step a generation back with a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360. They both have hundreds of games available and at around £150 each are a cheaper starting point. Even picking up an old PlayStation 1 or Dreamcast and a bunch of games at your local car boot sale will give you an idea or whether you like gaming or not.Where should I buy games?Smartphone/tabletAll you have to do is visit the online app store supported by your device by clicking on the icon on your home screen. If you have a Windows phone it’s Windows Store, on Android it’s Google Play and on Apple phones it’s the App Store. You’ve probably already done this to download something like Candy Crush Saga or Angry Birds (which are both great games), but there are more complex options out there too. We’ll get to that tomorrow.PCIf you want to play games on a PC or Mac, you should probably sign up for Steam. This is effectively a vast online shop, like the Apple App Store, where you buy games and then download them straight to your computer – you never need to own a boxed copy. Steam sells most of the latest blockbuster hits, but also has a vast range of interesting independent games (made by smaller studios) and a back catalogue of classic titles. There are regular sales too.Like Netflix or Amazon, Steam will also suggest games based on your previous purchases, and there’s a social element, so you can connect with friends and find out what they recommend.There are alternative digital shops (try Good Old Games, Green Man Gaming or EA’s own Origin store), but Steam dominates the market.ConsoleFor boxed games, supermarkets and major online stores like Amazon will get you the cheapest deals on the big new titles. There are a few high street retailers hanging on in there for dear life: HMV still sells games, and Game has had a resurgence over the last two years – it’s great for pre-owned titles (as are smaller chains like Planet Games and CEX).‘Great for pre-owned titles’ … UK retailer Game has enjoyed a recent resurgence.Photograph: AlamyPlayStation, Xbox and Wii also have their own online stores, allowing you to download both major new titles and smaller indie titles – the prices for big releases can be expensive though, and they take up lots of space on your hard drive. With both Xbox One and PlayStation 4, if you pay for a subscription to their online gaming services (Xbox Live and PlayStation Network), you also get to download free games every month, and you keep these for as long as you’re a subscriber.What else do I need?PCFor PC gaming, you’ll need a decent flatscreen monitor. I’d go for at least a 27-inch Full HD display, at 120Hz (though 60Hz is fine), with as low a response time (measured in milliseconds) as possible. There’s agreat PC Magazine guideto all the more complicated things you should look for.Most games are fine with mouse and keyboard control, but you can also buy a joypad for action games (the Xbox 360 wired controller is perfect). If you get into flight or space sims a specialist joystick like the Saitek X52 or Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X may eventually be a good idea.ConsoleIf you have a new console, a full high-definition (1080p) flatscreen TV is the idea option, though an older 720p ‘HD Ready’ set is fine – just something with an HDMI port in the back. I’d say you need at least a 40-inch display to get the best out of the visuals, but others disagree (and as commenters are pointing out below, it depends on the size of your room). These days you can get a good quality, decent-sized LED television for less than £500. LG, Panasonic, Sony and Samsung are good brands to look for. You need a television with the lowest possible “input lag” (the time it takes for the screen to respond to joypad movements), which can be an issue with TVs that use lots of high-tech picture processing technologies. Some have special Game Modes which tweak settings for speed and motion blur.You could check outDisplaylag.com, which lets you know about the input lag on most major new screens, orHDTVTestwhich rates and reviews TVs in alotof detail and usually mentions how good they are for gaming.What about 4K, the new generation of TVs which offer four times the visual clarity of current HD sets? They’re still a bit pricey and none of the consoles support them yet so it maybe a bit early to jump on that bandwagon.So what should I play?Ah, this is the big question. There is a dizzying array of video game genres, some of them are self-explanatory (driving sims, flight sims, fighting games, puzzle games), some of them not so much. Here’s a quick guide:First-person shooter (FPS):a shooting game in which you view the environment through the eyes of the lead protagonist. The aim will usually be to run through a series of linear environments shooting people/aliens/things.Current examples: Halo, Call of Duty, BattlefieldThird-person shooter/brawler:like the above except the lead character is visible onscreen, and there is often an emphasis on melee combat as well as shooting stuff. Current examples: Bayonetta, Metal Gear Solid, UnchartedRole-playing game (RPG):an adventure game, usually set in a fantasy or science fiction environment, where the player character gains new abilities, spells and weapons by fighting enemies and discovering treasure. This is a process known as collection experience points (XP) and “levelling up”.Current examples: Final Fantasy, Dragon Age, Dark Souls, WitcherMassively multiplayer online game (MMORPG):As above, but played in an online environment where hundreds of other gamers are also co-operating and competing. Fans usually join guilds (gaming teams) and attempt missions together.Current examples: World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, Eve OnlineWorld of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, the latest in the multiplayer online gaming franchise.Photograph: APReal-time strategy game (RTS):A battle strategy title in which players control an army of different vehicles (units) and must direct them against an opponent’s forces. Usually, players have to mine for resources in order to build units before putting them into battle. Both competitors move and command their armies at the same time, unlike turn-based strategy games like Civilization and XCOM.Current examples: Starcraft 2: Rome: Total War, Company of HeroesMultiplayer online battle arena (MOBA):A comparatively new genre, in which two small teams of warriors battle each other on small-scale environments using an array of weapons and spells. The aim is to destroy the opponent’s base structure. This is a team-based genre, with each warrior controlled by a different player.Current examples: League of Legends, Dota 2, SmiteOpen-world shooter:an action adventure game in which the player has free access to a large environment, often a fantasy realm or a modern city, and can freely explore. There is often a series of narrative missions which move the story along, but the world will also contain an array of optional side-quests and tasks, which provide different experiences and allow the player to “level up” with new items and abilities.Current examples: Grand Theft Auto, Far Cry, Assassin’s Creed, Tomb RaiderHow do I play online?You’ll need a broadband internet connection and a router. When you’re looking for a provider, you need one that offers fast downloadandupload speeds, and a stable connection with less jitter (fluctuating performance) and latency (delays in getting data to and from the internet). If you’re planning to download a lot of games, you should go for a service that offers unlimited data downloads. Also, find out if the service prioritises gaming traffic: some providers use traffic management to stabilise the service at peak times, but this can really impact gaming performance. Generally, Virgin Media, Sky and BT are all okay, but specialist broadband providers like PlusNet and Zen are pulling inincreasingly good reviews.Once you’re set up, you can either plug your console or PC directly into the router via an ethernet cable, or you can connect wirelessly via Wi-Fi (if you have a PC you may need to buy a Wi-Fi dongle for this). Generally, you’ll get a faster more stable gaming experience with a wired connection. If your games machine is in a different room to your router, you could try a power line adaptor – this uses your home’s electric wiring as a network.Most games make it really easy to play against other people online. There will probably be a “Multiplayer” option on the main menu: just click on that and follow the instructions. You may get a choice of playing “co-op” (with your friends against computer-controlled enemies) or “competitive” (playing against other people). If you don’t want to play against strangers, PlayStation, Xbox, Wii U and Steam all let you create friend lists of players you know, and you’ll be able to see when your pals are online.Come back tomorrow for our list of the top 20 games for beginners...

You can express happiness, anger or the feeling of wanting to shake off haters – but what happens when you’d like to text someone that you just want to stay at home? Designer Rebecca Lynch decided to solve the problem of communicating introspective emotions, such as leaving stressful social situations or giving introverted friends and partners the space and time they need, by creating her own “introji” andposting them on Facebook.Need more information; social anxiety.Together alone; complex thinking.“I started creating a communication system for introverts after my boyfriend of three years broke up with me citing the need for more time alone,” she explains. “I’m an introvert, too, but I realised my enthusiasm for being in a relationship sometimes overshadows my ability to read others’ signals. In my relationships and friendships, I use text messages with emoji, but often find myself reaching for a symbol that isn’t there, a little picture that could communicate a need or feeling easily where words might be misunderstood. So I started making introji, emoji for introverts, as an easier visual way to tell a loved one or friend that you need more time and space.”
