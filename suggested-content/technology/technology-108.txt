The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has said that it is looking intothe eBay break-in, which led to the company issuing password change notices to users on Wednesday.The ICO is considering a full investigation into the cyberattack that resulted inhackers gaining access to a databasethat held encrypted passwords as well as customer names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth which were not encrypted.“We’re certainly looking at the situation,” Christopher Graham the Information Commissionertold BBC Radio 5 live. “We have to work with colleagues in Luxembourg where eBay is based for European purposes. We were in touch with the Luxembourg data protection authority yesterday.”Three separate states havealready started investigations into the data breachat eBay in the US, as well as the US Federal Trade Commission which is described as having &quot;eye-watering powers to deal with American companies&quot; by Graham.“We have relationships with and proactively contacted a number of state, federal, and international regulators and law enforcement agencies. We are fully cooperating with them on all aspects of this incident,” said an eBay spokesperson.‘You’ve got to make sure you do not get foot faulted’Jurisdictional issues may complicate the investigation. Ebay&apos;s headquarters are in Luxembourg, which means Luxembourg&apos;s data protection authority must take the lead in the first instance.“When you’re taking on a big global player like eBay you’ve got to make sure you do not get foot faulted and do something that would get you into trouble with the lawyers,” Graham explained.The ICO will look at the time it took eBay to realise the compromise, which is said to have happened in late February or early March but only discovered in May, and the company’s handling of the situation, specifically around how long it took eBay to do something about it and inform the authorities in the first instance.‘Personal information is not their plaything’The auction site has been heavily criticised by security experts over its failure to encrypt the personal data of its users beyond passwords.“This sort of thing is going to go on and on and on until businesses wake up and realise that personal information is not their plaything; it’s our information and it needs to be protected,” said Graham.“It is inexcusable for a company the size of eBay with the amount of data it holds to not encrypt all personal information held and to not constantly be at the forefront of security technology,” said Rik Ferguson, global vice president of security research at security software firm Trend Microtalking to the Guardian.The hacker’s access to the database, gained via stolen eBay employee identities, puts eBay’s users at risk of phishing attacks and identity theft using personal information like postal addresses and dates of birth, which are used to verify identity.Europe’s data protection watchdogs are scheduled to meet next week to discuss European data issues, including the European court of justiceover the right to be forgotten, but eBay’s protection of user data is likely to be high on the agenda.“It worries me that we’re not sufficiently alert to what is going on in the 21st century. None of us are taking this serious enough, none of us are as good as we should be about passwords, changing them regularly and using credible, hard passwords that aren’t just the name of your cat or your mother-in-law,” said Graham.•Ebay denies &apos;database&apos; on sale for 1.45 bitcoin is authentic•Ebay hack Q&amp;A: should I change my password?

An executive appointed by the Australian government to run the national broadband network is named in a legal action connected to his management of an American gas company subsequently responsible for one of the largest utility disasters in California’s history.Bill Morrow, appointed as chief executive of NBNCo in December 2013 by the newly elected Abbott government,has run a number of major infrastructure companiesincluding San Francisco&apos;s Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E).PG&amp;E stands accused of putting profits and bonuses before safety.Morrow joined PG&amp;E in 2006 as chief operating officer, and became chief executive a year later. He waspaid $3.8m in 2007andanother $4.48m in 2008in wages, benefits and stock, according to regulatory filings. Morrow left PG&amp;E in September 2008.On 24 December 2008 a man was killed in Rancho Cordova, California, after a teenage girl lit a cigarette, triggering a massive pipeline explosion that injured five others.The state gas industry regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), ordered PG&amp;E to pay a $38m fine in 2011 following an investigation that found the pipeline was weaker than allowed by safety regulations, and had not been pressure tested.In 2010, another pipeline explosion in San Bruno killed eight people and destroyed or damaged more than 100 homes.Investigators found many of the same problems in the Rancho Cordova explosion had triggered the 2010 disaster. The San Bruno explosion is characterised in numerous reports as one of the largest and most deadly utility disasters in California history.An investigation of the San Bruno event by theNational Transport Safety Boardblamed PG&amp;E’s “inadequate pipeline integrity management program”, which failed to find or fix a faulty pipe section that had been laid originally in the mid-1950s.The NTSB findings also pointed the finger at CPUC for failing to detect the inadequacies of PG&amp;E’s pipeline management program; and the transport department’s “exemptions of existing pipelines from the regulatory requirement for pressure testing, which likely would have detected the installation defects”.For its part, the CPUC has roundly criticised PG&amp;E for inadequate safety practices, internal cost-cutting practices outside industry norms, and the alleged diversion of maintenance funds to executive bonuses and shareholder returns.The two explosions occurred after Morrow had left PG&amp;E.But various detailed investigations are critical of the company’s priorities, practices and decision-making over a period spanning more than a decade, including the two years when Morrow was in key executive positions.A CPUC report hasalleged $100m was diverted by PG&amp;E from safetyand pipeline maintenance over 15 years. It suggests maintenance spending wasunder significant pressure in 2008, and in the two years immediately after Morrow’s departure.“Gas safety funding was heavily constrained in the 2008, 2009 and 2010 budget process,” says an audit undertaken by Overland Consulting for the CPUC.“Integrity management and maintenance project budgets were viewed as discretionary funding that could be reduced to meet the overall budget targets set by executive management,” it says.Morrow has been named along with 21 other PG&amp;E executives in aconsolidated shareholder derivative lawsuitwhich has been launched against the company, its directors and management.The suit filed in the San Mateo county court alleges that Morrow, as president and chief operating officer, was in a leadership role at a time when the company was “grossly under-spending on operational and process safety creating a situation where a catastrophic incident was not only possible, but highly likely”.It alleges Morrow was responsible for implementing a risk management system for critical infrastructure but, with the “support and approval” of other PG&amp;E executives, allowed the company to “make safety a low priority in comparison to profits”.The suit, which is also critical of the CPUC, alleges that from 2004 to 2009 the company was cited 410 times for unsafe practices in its gas operations. It cites federal safety data to allege that between 2004 and 2010 the company had more “reportable incidents” than any other gas company in the United States.The plaintiffs, Hind Bou-Salman, Gary Sender and Martha Potiriades, who are all shareholders of PG&amp;E, are seeking the return of “lucrative executive compensation packages allegedly approved by senior management at the same time safety budgets were being slashed”,according to a statement from their lawyersat Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy.A spokesman for NBNCo said Morrow was aware the legal proceedings were under way.“It relates to civil proceedings for shareholder compensation directed against both PG&amp;E and a large number of former officers and directors of the company,” the NBNCo spokesman told Guardian Australia on Friday.Of the San Bruno incident, the spokesman said: “This was a tragic accident which caused a great deal of pain to many people. The safety of workers and communities has always been Mr Morrow’s paramount concern.”Asked why Morrow chose to leave PG&amp;E in 2008, the spokesman said: “Mr Morrow left PG&amp;E to return to the telecommunications industry.”The company’s reputation in the US has taken a battering from these incidents. In a swingeinglegal brieflast year the CPUC’s office of ratepayer advocates compared PG&amp;E to Charles Manson, and accused it of destroying evidence. “It is not an overstatement to say that PG&amp;E has the contrition of Charlie Manson – that is to say, it has none.”The NBNCo spokesman said any questions relating to PG&amp;E “should be referred to PG&amp;E”.In April 2014, a federal grand jury for the northern district of California also returned an indictmentcharging PG&amp;E with 12 violationsof the gas pipeline safety act. According to a statement from the FBI: “The indictment alleges that PG&amp;E knowingly and willfully violated the PSA and its regulations between 2003 and 2010.“According to the indictment, the charges stem from PG&amp;E’s record keeping and pipeline integrity management practices. The indictment alleges that PG&amp;E failed to address recordkeeping deficiencies concerning its larger natural gas pipelines, knowing that their records were inaccurate or incomplete.”The NBNCo spokesman said Morrow had not been called to give evidence in the grand jury proceedings, and “whether or not this occurs is a matter for the US courts”.Morrow’s appointment continues something of a tradition of past controversy by heads of the NBNCo. Labor’s appointee to the NBNCo, Mike Quigley, had to answer questions about his actions and responsibilities as a senior executive at Alcatel Lucent when it was revealed there had been corruption in Costa Rica. Quigley repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.A spokesman for the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said on Friday the government had been made fully aware of the various allegations surrounding Morrow’s period at PG&amp;E.Government sources have told Guardian Australia the cabinet was entirely aware of the history at the time of Morrow’s appointment to NBNCo.NBNCo said the same thing when Guardian Australia asked whether there had been full disclosure to the government. “Mr Morrow openly canvassed these matters with both the NBNCo board and the government during the recruitment process for the role at NBNCo.”Immediately before joining NBNCo, Morrow was the chief executive of Vodafone Hutchison Australia.
A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamFacebook adjusts its privacy controls — again &gt;&gt; BusinessweekJoshua Brustein:For years people have been complaining that Facebook's (FB) privacy controls are too confusing, and the social network made several changes to these policies on Thursday that indicate it agrees.For new users' first post, Facebook's default setting will be to share only with their friends. This makes sense, considering that someone who hasn't been on Facebook before is less likely to realize what kind of risks he's taking by posting private thoughts. "We recognize that it is much worse for someone to accidentally share with everyone when they actually meant to share just with friends, compared with the reverse," the company says in a statement posted on its website.In addition, Facebook is rolling out a privacy checkup tool, which will remind people whom they are sharing with, which apps they're connected to, and what kind of information they're sharing through their profiles. Facebook users will begin seeing the checkups over the next couple of weeks.*golf clap*Smartphones now 95% of total handset revenues &gt;&gt; Counterpoint Technology Market ResearchNeil Shah with some more nuggets:• Smartphone revenues now accounts to 95% of the total handset shipment revenues globally, highest ever. Feature phones are moving towards oblivion (pretty quickly).• Apple captured more than a third of those revenues with Samsung closely behind Apple with revenue share, together capturing more than two-third of global smartphone revenues as wellIf we leave out Samsung, Apple generates more revenues than all the global smartphone brands combined• Xiaomi is now the fifth largest smartphone brand in terms of revenues overtaking likes of Nokia, Lenovo, Motorola, Coolpad and Huawei and on track to challenge LG &amp; Sony for the third spot confirming its volume market share gains during the quarter, thanks to its smartphone models entering the global best-sellers list during the quarterThe iPad's next killer app: Osmo connects iOS kids' games with the real world &gt;&gt; GigaomJanko Roettgers:The other inspiration for Osmo was Sharma's previous job. Before launching the company, he worked for seven years at Google, where some of his duties included working on Google's book scanning project. Back then, he started thinking about what else you could scan, and how you bring real objects into the virtual space.Turns out, making this work in the real world isn't actually all that easy. Osmo has to work under variable lighting conditions, on different kinds of tables and with objects that align in countless ways. Conventional image processing doesn't work for this unless you force kids to always align their letter cards (the way I did the first time I tried it), require play on white backgrounds and impose all other kinds of unrealistic constraints.Children play differently than adults do.Surface Pro 3: niche product, not a saviour &gt;&gt; Tech-ThoughtsSameer Singh:The challenge for tablets is to move upmarket into productivity use cases without compromising on their advantages over PCs - 1) ease of use, and 2) lower price points. With the Windows 8 operating system and a price tag starting at $930 (incl. the keyboard cover), the Surface Pro 3 misses on both points.The primary selling point of the Surface is access to legacy applications which are practically unusable without the keyboard cover (the fact that this is still sold as an optional accessory is puzzling). In other words, the Surface is not a tablet, but an ultraportable PC or "ultrabook" which happens to have a touchscreen. The product has been designed to cater to a very niche segment of enterprise users, i.e. users who have already decided to purchase a portable PC over a tablet. This leavesno room to move upmarketand no flexibility to move downmarket. The sub-par mobile app ecosystem for Windows Phone/RT limits downmarket movement as well.HP SlateBook 14 is an Android notebook with a Tegra chip &gt;&gt; LiliputingThe SlateBook 14 reportedly features a 14in, full HD touchscreen display, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage.It has a microSD card slot, HDMI port, 3 USB ports, audio jack, and  802.11b/g/n WiFi, and Bluetooth.

In short, the gist was that AdWords doesn't work for companies as big as eBay, and paid search is only marginally useful for acquiring new customers. You can read more about their findings and methodology inthis summary at Harvard Business Review.As I pointed out at the time, eBay's failure to make paid search work for them had nothing to do with AdWords and everything to do with their poorly managed campaigns and atrocious misuse of AdWords features like Dynamic Keyword InsertionEssentially, Panda 4.0 seems to treat eBay as a content farm because it has lots of internal links.Four things we've learned from the EU Google judgment &gt;&gt; ICO BlogThe Information Commissioner's Office is the UK's official data protection authority:This is a judgment that we welcome. It sets out a framework to hold data controllers operating online search engines to account for the personal data they process. It also backs our view that search engines are subject to data protection law, clarifying an area that was previously uncertain.It's worth noting that the judgment does all this under the existing European Data Protection Directive. Some critics have previously suggested the law is no longer fit for purpose – and indeed we'd still back calls for it to be updated – but this ruling shows the existing directive can still be relevant when discussing modern data protection issues.Graphics card demand drops in 2Q14 partly because of changes in Bitcoin ecosystem &gt;&gt; Digitimes…as chips designed for Bitcoin mining started appearing in early 2014, demand for graphics cards has been dropping. Since mining chips have advantages in size, power consumption, reliability and costs, most Bitcoin operators have turned to dedicated chips instead, the sources said.Bitcoin's dropping demand is also affecting overall demand for mining machines, the sources added.With China also not seeing any significant increases in graphics card demand, global graphics shipments are expected to drop 10-20% sequentially in the second quarter, the sources estimated.Hope nobody at the graphics cards companies was making forward plans based on the upward growth of sales last year.You can followGuardian Technology's linkbucket on PinboardTo suggest a link, either add it below or tag it with @gdntech on the freeDeliciousservice.

Independent music labels are at loggerheads with YouTube over the licensing terms for its upcoming streaming music subscription service.The service – still not officially announced, but the subject of longstanding speculation within the music and technology industries – is expected to compete directly with Spotify, Deezer and their rivals.Music industry trade association the Worldwide Independent Network (WIN) has accused YouTube of strong-arm negotiating tactics trying to force indie labels to sign up to the new service.WIN, which represents independent labels worldwide, claims that YouTube is approaching labels directly with a &quot;template contract&quot; and threatening that if they do not sign it, all their music videos will be blocked on YouTube.It also claims the terms of the contract are non-negotiable, and undervalue the music of these labels in comparison to Spotify, Rdio, Deezer and other subscription streaming services.WIN had planned to issue a press release lambasting YouTube this morning, with quotes from other indie trade bodies around the world.Overnight, new talks with YouTube and the prospect of a resolution to the dispute led to the release being put on hold, but press agency AFP – which like The Guardian had seen the original release – ran its story as planned.&quot;Our members are small businesses who rely on a variety of income streams to invest in new talent. They are being told by one of the largest companies in the world to accept terms that are out of step with the marketplace for streaming,” said WIN chief executive Alison Wenham in the original release.“We believe, as such, that these actions are unnecessary and indefensible, not to mention commercially questionable and potentially damaging to YouTube itself, given the harm likely to result from this approach.”Contacted by The Guardian overnight, YouTube provided this response: &quot;YouTube provides a global platform for artists to connect with fans and generate revenue for their music,&quot; said a spokesperson. &quot;We have successful deals in place with hundreds of independent and major labels around the world, however we don&apos;t comment on ongoing negotiations.&quot;Sending contracts directly to independent labels would be a controversial move in itself, because many are members of another trade body, Merlin, which negotiates collective licensing deals with new digital music services on their behalf.Merlin declined to comment when contacted by The Guardian, although its chief executiveCharles Caldas recently criticised at YouTubein a speech at industry conference Music Connected, referring to a quote from musician Billy Bragg suggesting artists who criticise Spotify for its low royalty payments &quot;should be marching to YouTube central with flaming pitchforks&quot;.At Music Connected, Caldas said &quot;The ironic thing is that the service that pays the least is the service that’s the most well funded and run by the biggest company in the world: their figures are by far the worst, whether you measure them on a per-stream basis or a per-user basis,&quot; before adding &quot;I can’t say Billy’s right, but I can say that he’s not wrong.&quot; – a hint at possibly-fraught negotiations between Merlin and YouTube.WIN and Merlin are completely separate organisations, and WIN is not involved in those licensing discussions. Its concern is over the &quot;termination&quot; letters that it says have been sent to labels, threatening to block their content on YouTube if they do not sign up to the new service. WIN has now given YouTube a 24-hour deadline to rescind those letters.While YouTube&apos;s negotiating tactics have left many indie labels feeling bullied, its current online video service has also become an important platform for them to help musicians build their fanbases.That was emphasised at the Music Connect conference where Caldas made his comments. A separate panel of indie labels talking about how they break new artists all agreed that YouTube – along with another free service, SoundCloud – was crucial to their efforts.Meanwhile,YouTube executives defended the company against criticism from labels and artistsat the Midem music industry conference in February. &quot;We’ve paid out to the music industry over the last several years over a billion dollars,&quot; said vice president of YouTube content Tom Pickett at the show.YouTube&apos;s plans to go head to head with Spotify, Deezer and other subscription music services have been rumoured for some time. In March,the New York Post reported that it would be called Music Pass, and would likely cost $5 a month with ads or $10 a month for an ad-free version.•Why is the music industry so cross with Google?
Facebook has responded to frustration over its privacy policies by switching off the default setting that led many users to accidentally share their posts with the entire world wide web.Anyone joining Facebook from Thursday will only share their posts with friends and family, unless they explicitly choose to make their information open to everyone online, according to aposton the company's blog. The change will not affect its existing 1.28bn account holders, who will be prompted to carry out a "privacy check-up".Facebook is facing stiff competition from a wave of social apps such as Snapchat, Secret and WhatsApp – which it recently acquired for $19bn (£11bn) – that have made discretion a selling point. The company's privacy product manager, Mike Nowak, said the decision to reduce the risk of new users over-sharing was taken in response to feedback from its subscribers."If people share more publicly than they want to be sharing, that doesn't benefit us because it leads to bad experiences over time," said Nowak. "We want people's first impressions of Facebook to be as awesome as possible, and we know it's worse to accidentally overshare than to accidentally undershare."When it first allowed users to share posts publicly in 2009, the default setting was public, allowing anyone else online to see them. Facebook's decision was a hit with online advertisers eager to glean as much data as possible on its millions of users, but has been a constant source of concern for the public.In 2011, the company was forced into a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, vowing to never make deceptive claims about its privacy procedures and agreeing to independent reviews of its practices.Most recently,Facebook is being suedby a group of parents on whether it can use their children's images in adverts without consent.For the last decade, Facebook has pushed the boundaries of privacy, encouraging and occasionally forcing account holders to share increasing amounts of information. ButEdward Snowden's revelations about the NSAhave encouraged Silicon Valley's technology companies to take a stand on protecting their users' information, and regulators in Europe and America have begun to act to protect the rights of individuals online.Last week, theEuropean court of Justice ruled against Google, in favour of a complainant arguing for the right to be forgotten by the search engine."They have gotten enough privacy black eyes at this point that I tend to believe they realised they have to take care of consumers a lot better," said Pam Dixon, executive director of the campaign group World Privacy Forum.This spring, Facebook introduced a privacy mascot in the shape of a blue dinosaur, dubbed "Zuckersaurus" after the social network's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, which pops up as people are about to release posts, prompting the user to make sure they are not sharing more widely than they intended.In its post on the change, Facebook said: "While some people want to post to everyone, others have told us that they are more comfortable sharing with a smaller group, like just their friends. We recognise that it is much worse for someone to accidentally share with everyone when they actually meant to share just with friends, compared with the reverse."
Intimate photographs should be deleted at the end of a relationship if one of the partners calls for it, a court in Germany has ruled.The ruling by the Koblenz higher regional court has resonated throughout a digital world grappling with the balance between freedom of expression and privacy. It was welcomed by experts who said it would empower victims of "revenge porn" to be more proactive when seeking the deletion of compromising images.In the case concerned, a man from the Lahn-Dill region in Hesse had taken several erotic photographs of his female partner, to which she had consented at the time. After the end of their relationship, the woman had demanded the deletion of the images, seeking legal help when the man refused.The Koblenz court ruled in her favour on Tuesday even though her ex-partner had to date shown no intention of reproducing the pictures or putting them online. Consent to use and own privately recorded nude pictures, the court stated, could in this instance be withdrawn on the grounds of personal rights, which are valued higher than the ownership rights of the photographer.The court did specify that the woman could only seek the deletion of nude or erotic photographs, not those showing the couple fully clothed. The man may still appeal against the decision.The ruling has been welcomed by both legal experts and support groups for victims of online bullying. Michaela Brauburger, who educates young people about responsible use of social media in Germany, told the Guardian: "Increasingly, young people share and upload images without giving it much thought. We constantly try to educate young girls in particular to think about what may happen to intimate photographs after they are taken. Hopefully this decision will empower them to broach the issue with their partners before it is too late."Lawyer Tim Geissler, who specialises in "revenge porn" cases, said that while there were ways in which people who had had compromising images of themselves published online could seek their deletion, they could only do so after the damage had been done. He cited the example of a couple from Düsseldorf in their early thirties. She was a part-time model, he was a hobby photographer and they liked taking pictures of each other: on holidays, at home, and sometimes in the bedroom.The couple divorced in 2010 – the man had acted aggressively towards his wife and beaten her several times. A few months later, the woman discovered he had shared intimate photographs of her on Facebook, alleging she had started doing pornographic shoots since their separation.She sought legal help and eventually a court ordered her ex-husband to delete the photographs from his Facebook account. But, Geissler said, had he posted the pictures anonymously, it may have been impossible to get a legal grip on the offender.By the time the victim sought legal help, the offence had been committed but if the Koblenz ruling were to set a precedent, she could have asked for the pictures to be deleted straight after the divorce.Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, a professor of internet governance and regulation at Oxford University, warned against seeing the Koblenz decision as being the direct result of this month's European court of Justice ruling against Google, which some say could help establish a pan-European "right to be forgotten"."The Koblenz decision was not about data protection but the 'right for one's own image', which is a special construction of continental European jurisprudence," said Mayer-Schönberger. "But what can be said is that is that these two rulings may make more and more people aware of their personal rights in the digital sphere. At the very least, it should embolden future claimants who pro-actively want to prevent revenge porn.""We can detect a wider trend here," said Christian Solmecke, a German lawyer who has worked on a number of "revenge porn" cases. "In the future we may increasingly find that images or data whose publication was lawful at the time may have to be deleted as circumstances change".
In the city of the future, the satnav will direct drivers not only to their destination, but route their journey straight to the nearest available parking space.For Milton Keynes residents, this vision of motoring utopia could soon become reality, after the council signed a contract with BT to install a public network for "the internet of things" – the idea of linking smartphones to household hardware such as washing machines and heating, and now car park spaces.Digital parking spaces that signal when they are empty, and smart bins that send a message to rubbish collectors when they are overflowing, will be installed across the city centre from September in the first city-wide project to trial these technologies in the UK. In a joint project with Cambridge based startup Neul, BT is building 15 base stations across Milton Keynes which will be connected to the internet and be able to pick up signals from sensors in thousands of objects.Over the next 18 months, the trial will be extended beyond bins and parking to dozens of things such as rodent traps, soap dispensers, water meters and central heating systems."It's probably the biggest revolution we've seen in technology, this embedding of computing in everything around us, and it will make our lives more convenient, more fun and less wasteful," said Neul's chief executive Stan Boland.BT and Neul are looking for ideas that could be useful not only to the daily lives of residents and businesses. The technology might be suitable for tracking children, people with Alzheimer's, and even lost pets. It could also be used to create intelligent buildings, with security tags for staff and internet-connected fire alarms. Initially, around 50 to 100 bins and parking spaces will be wired up but within two months this will expand to about 1,000 of each.Parking spaces will be fitted with studs, about 6in in diameter, that look like cat's eyes and are glued to the tarmac. Developed by a company called Deteq that has already tested them in Ipswich and a multistorey car park in Crawley, the studs detect radio waves like those emitted by mobile networks. Because cars block most radio waves, the sensors know when the space is full.They send a signal back to one of Neul's base stations, which are being attached by BT to masts and street lamps. The studs are powered by two AA batteries but need very little energy to operate, which means they can last up to 10-15 years.The location of empty spaces, overlaid on Google maps, will be visible on the Milton Keynes website, along with data about which car parks are filling up or emptying. The developers are working on ways to feed the data into satnavs and smartphones to help drivers get to the nearest space. Deteq also has an app that allows drivers to pay for parking without having to put money in the meter, although this will not be available to begin with."The initial application for the council is to make more efficient use of parking spaces," said BT project director Alan Ward. "What we want to move on to is linking your parking spot to your journey planner, reducing the time you spend travelling looking for somewhere to park."Congestion in town centres is often made much worse by drivers circling for a space, and Milton Keynes is hoping the technology will reduce traffic jams.By connecting its bins, the council expects to save money by sending rubbish trucks only to locations where they are needed. Its bins will use ultrasound, bouncing sound waves across the top levels of the container to detect rubbish, and sending a signal back to base when full."If you know where something is or what its status is you can resource your engineers to go and fix it, empty it, make less journeys," said Ward. "There are immediate savings in efficiencies like that."
Ebay says that a database being offered for sale online by a hacker who claims it contains details of the auction site&apos;s users – which were compromisedin a cyberattack that was revealed on Wednesday– is not authentic.Someone claiming to have a copy of eBay&apos;s stolen database is offering to sell it for 1.45 bitcoin (about £447) via the anonymous text file site Pastebin.But eBay denied that an extract linked from the site belonged to its users. The hacker provided a 3,000-row extract from a database with Asian-Pacific user names, addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth as proof that they are in possession of the full 145 million user database.&quot;The published lists we have checked so far are not authentic eBay accounts,&quot; said an eBay spokesperson talking to the Guardian.Security experts have begun trying to narrow down the source of the extract. UK cyber security company Digital Shadows said that cross-referencing the leaked data with publicly available information on Facebook appears to confirm that the names are real, even if they did not come from eBay.&quot;It is always tough to tell whether the data is genuine in situations like this,&quot; explained Rik Ferguson, global vice president of security research at security software firm Trend Micro.&quot;The email addresses I have tested so far do not appear to be sourced from previous breaches,&quot; said Ferguson who later confirmed that the database was likely fake.&apos;One or two&apos; company identities were the keyEbay took two months to discover it had been hacked because no &quot;unusual activity&quot; was detected until May, the company has revealed.“One or two” eBay employee company identities were stolen between the end of February and the beginning of March, but it wasn’t until repeated attempts were made to access a database – which those identities were not authorised to access – that the intrusion attempt was discovered, a company spokesperson explained to the Guardian.The stolen identities could not be used to access other companies owned by the auction site, including PayPal or GumTree, the spokesman said.145 million potentially exposedThe e-commerce site, which listed 233 million total registered accounts, has 145 million active users, all of whomhave been asked to change their passwordsafter the company discovered that its customer database had been broken into. Ebay has 14 million users in the UK.Ebay would not comment on whether the database exposed in the hack contained the private data of all 145 million active users globally, which helped the company process $212bn in commerce in 2013.Security experts have criticised the company for not encrypting all private customer information it held, which includes customer names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth.Security levels“We use different levels of security based on different types of information we’re storing, and all financial information across all of eBay’s businesses is encrypted,” the company spokesman said.“It is inexcusable for a company the size of eBay with the amount of data it holds to not encrypt all personal information held,” said Ferguson.&apos;Serious from an identity theft perspective&apos;Despite eBay seemingly not putting importance on personal information like postal addresses and dates of birth, the repercussions of this data theft could be felt for a long time after the break-in.“I am concerned that not only have they lost my email, username and password, but according to their website the loss includes home address, phone number and date of birth. This is serious from an identity theft perspective,” said Hugh Boyes from the Institution of Engineering and Technology.“The only item they are missing is mother&apos;s maiden name and they have sufficient information to impersonate an individual when dealing with many financial organisations,” Boyes said.User passwords exposed in the break-in were encrypted, however, and were “hashedandsalted” with “no evidence shown that the encryption on passwords has been broken,” according to thecompany’s Twitter account.Ebay is “aggressively investigating” the intrusion with law enforcement, but has seen no evidence that user accounts have been abused.•Ebay hack Q&amp;A: should I change my password?

Google says it foresees a future of advertising a few years from now in which they could appear on anything from thermostats to refrigerators to car dashboards and watches.The official remark that such devices could soon be serving &quot;ads and other content&quot; appears in a formalfiling to the US Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) made in December 2013 but only just released. But it drew a quick rebuttal from Tony Fadell, chief executive and founder of Nest, which makes internet-controlled thermostats and wasacquired by Google in January for $3.2bn.&quot;Nest is being run independently from the rest of Google, with a separate management team, brand and culture,&quot; Fadelltold the news site Re/Code. &quot;We have nothing against ads - after all Nest does lots of advertising. We just don&apos;t think ads are right for the Nest user experience.&quot; Fadell had previously had to emphasise that the acquisition of Nest by Google would not lead to a change in its privacy policy or data sharing.Google also put out a statement in which it said it aimed to &quot;clarify the language&quot; of the filing and that &quot;Nest, which we acquired after this filing was made, does not have an ads-based model and has never had any such plans.&quot;Google generates around95% of its revenueand almost all of its profit from online advertising. The filing followed pressure from the SEC to break out the sources of its advertising between PC-based &quot;desktop&quot; and &quot;mobile&quot; sources. Some investors suspect that mobile ads generate lower revenues and interaction, and that the shift of internet use towards mobile phones and away from PCs could affect Google&apos;s revenues.But in the filing the company says that many different elements affect the profitability and value of its adverts, such as whether they appear on sites it owns, exchange rate movements, and whether new ad formats are available on different platforms.It also says that lumping both mobile phones and tablets into a single &quot;mobile&quot; category could be misleading because tablets&apos; usage &quot;has much more in common with desktops than with handsets&quot;. The company suggests that &quot;It is increasingly challenging to define what exactly a &quot;mobile&quot; platform is from period to period - and what it will be going forward.&quot;It also expects &quot;smart devices&quot; to start changing the market for online advertising. Google has already indicated its interest in extending the use of its Android mobile software to other platforms. In January itsigned a tieup with car manufacturersincluding Audi, General Motors, Honda and Hyundai to bring Android to car dashboards.Then in March itannounced its &quot;Android Wear&quot; initiativeto bring Android to smartwatches and other wearable devices.In the past few weeks it announced that its Google Glass wearable device is available to buy for anyone in the US.Google also revealed in the filing that during 2013 it &quot;pursued but discontinued a potential buyout of a foreign [non-US] company, with a valuation estimated in the range of $4 to $5bn&quot;. The company isn&apos;t named; Google&apos;s largest purchase of a non-US company during 2013 was of the Israeli traffic mapping company Waze, which it bought for $1bn.•Nest smoke alarms returning to sale amid reports of total recall
US educational startupCodecademyis opening its first international office, in London, after signing up 2 million Britons for its online computer programming courses.The news comes as British schools and teachers prepare for the introduction of a new curriculum in September that will introduce children to coding at a much younger age.Codecademy already has partnerships in the UK with after-school coding club network Code Club and educational body Computing At School (CAS), and says its resources have been used by more than 1,000 schools in the UK.Alongside the new London office, Codecademy is announcing partnerships with governments and companies in France, Brazil, Argentina and Estonia to localise its courses and launch pilot schemes to encourage more people to sign up for them.&quot;More than 70% of Codecademy users are outside the US, so this announcement is really focused on broadening the assets to reach new countries, as well as working with the right partners in countries where we&apos;ve seen big takeup,&quot; Codecademy chief executive Zach Sims told the Guardian.The company&apos;s UK office will be headed by Rachel Swidenbank, who joined Codecademy in April from management consultancy Bain &amp; Company.&quot;We&apos;ve already had a lot of relationships with key influencers and partners in the UK, including Computing At School. A lot of schools are using Codecademy to train up teachers ahead of the new curriculum&apos;s introduction,&quot; she said.&quot;The fact that coding has now been put onto the national curriculum solidifies how important it is going forward. We have school-specific efforts and also materials made for teachers. We&apos;re focused on partnering with as many schools as we can.&quot;Sims and co-founder Ryan Bubinski founded Codecademy in 2011, and have since raised $12.5m from investors including Sir Richard Branson and investment firms Y Combinator, Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers and Index Ventures.Besides the London office, Codecademy is working with Bibliotheques sans Frontieres in France to translate its courses into French and run pilots in schools; with educational foundation The Lemann Foundation in Brazil to translate into Portugese; with the government of Buenos Aires in Argentina to get the courses into schools; and with the Estonian government&apos;s Tiger Leap education initiative.The company also recently redesigned its website to be more accessible to fledgling programmers, while also offering more courses designed to be of practical use in their real careers, rather than simply teaching core skills.&quot;We&apos;re developing a 21st-century educational brand that&apos;s fun and easy enough for people to use, but also recognise by industries as a solid way for people to learn these skills,&quot; said Sims.&quot;People like chunked, smaller events of learning, and they like building real projects – on our new course,people can build the Airbnb website. We&apos;re not just teaching theory: we&apos;re teaching people to actually build something.&quot;•Learning to code: Q&amp;A with Zach Sims
Ebay suffering thebiggest hack of all timeled to the exposure of lots of personal data including postal addresses, dates of birth and phone numbers for millions of people around the world.While the company insists no financial information was stolen, private personal data still holds a lot of value.But what options do users have when a site demands personal information as a condition of use, with no way of determining how secure that data will be?“We have to take care of our data, but in many circumstances if we want to use a service we have no choice but to surrender data, stuff that is very difficult to change,” Rik Ferguson, global vice president of security research at security software firm Trend Micro, told the Guardian in the wake of the hack.“It’s all very welltelling everyone to go out and change their passwords, but you can’t go and change your postal address, telephone number, name and date of birth.”Shopping services need your postal address to deliver goods, for instance, media services need your date of birth to verify age, and a taxi firm will need your phone number to alert you when its car arrives outside your door.“All organisations that are hold any sort of private or financial information should absolutely be encrypting that data at all times – there is no excuse for not doing so,” says Ferguson.Unfortunately, eBay’s hack has proved that not all companies are as good at protecting your personal data as they should be.“All data that is shared should be done so in the knowledge that it absolutely is at risk from targeted attack. All of that data has financial value to the attacker, and they will continue to go after it.”Just the bare minimum, ma&apos;amThe safest way to protect yourself is simply to not give out any personal information. When that isn’t possible, provide the absolute bare minimum. After all, why does an internet company need to know where you live or have your phone number?Avoid giving any over any more information than is absolutely necessary and required for the service to work. And if that is more information than you are prepared to give, perhaps the service isn’t worth the risk. Your information is valuable to the company you are giving it to, just as much as it is to the hackers that may gain access to it, and therefore they often ask for much more information than they really should.Don’t give your credit card details to every shopCredit card details are one of the most valuable pieces of information you own and therefore one of the primary targets for any criminal hacker. Consider using other secure forms of payment that do not require you to hand over your credit card details.“PayPal represents a great example of giving data to a secure third-party so that you don’t have to give your credit card details to everyone you buy from, but of course that makes it single potential weak point in the chain,” explains Ferguson. (PayPal is owned by eBay, but was not affected by the hack on the auction site, and has its details encrypted, it says.)Many other services, including Google Wallet and Visa’sV.me, are available to shield your payment information from online stores, but it is very important that you secure those accounts as much as possible with very strong passwords and, where available,two-factor authentication(where another tool like a number generator is used to protect your login).Tweak your postal addressWhile giving out your post address for services is often unavoidable, there are some things you can do to protect yourself.When a service that is not going to send you parcels asks for your address you can leave out one crucial factor. For instance, if you happen to live in a flat you can leave off the flat number of your address, simply listing the building number.Also, if a company is using your address or postcode to simply verify the country or two you live in, as is often the case with online streaming services, consider giving them another postcode of the next street over or one in a surrounding area.Use an alternate phone numberQuite a lot of services require a phone number to verify your identity. The companies use the potential security of the mobile phone operator’s registration process to strengthen your proposition that you are who you say you are. But giving up your real phone number could lead to a deluge of spam calls or phishing attacks should it be stolen.Some services can essentially be fobbed off with a fake phone number, but others may actually use that number. So instead of giving them your primary phone number, considering giving them a secondary phone number.One idea is to register another pay as you go account mobile phone number – simply getting a SIM from a mobile phone provider is often free and easy via the web or operator stores – and put that in an old phone for when you need to receive a call.Once you have a secondary number registered, you could also set up call forwarding so that the number simply forwards to your real, primary phone number. That way you can continue receiving verification phone calls and queries as if you had given out your primary phone number, but can safely ditch the secondary number if it is stolen in a hacking attack – without having to tell all your family and friends about a new phone number.Don&apos;t give your full nameYour name is almost always the bare minimum of information required to set up and use internet services. That makes it the most readily available piece of personal information on the internet.Consider giving certain sites and services a fake name, a nickname or perhaps a jumble of your real name, swapping your first and last names. Never give your full name with middle names if at all possible. That way hackers don’t get your actual real name and another piece of information that could lead to identity theft.Fudge your date of birthLots of sites and services require your date of birth, often to verify age. But there’s no reason you have to give them your real date of birth. It is one of the most used pieces of private information for verifying your identity to banks and other crucial financial services - so should be protected.Consider giving less crucial services a fake birthday. It doesn’t even need to be that different, but a month or a day change, or even a single digit year change should be enough to prevent it being used to gain access to your bank account, for instance.Remember to make it a memorable one in case you&apos;re asked for it as a security check, and for extra memorability, use the same fake birthday on every site. (Unix fans might like 1 January 1970, for example.)Use multiple email addressesAn email address is often far more important than it is given credit for. Most services allow users to reset a password or regain access to locked accounts by using an email address for verification.But once a hacker has access to your email account, they potentially have access to any other service that uses that email account to retrieve lost login credentials. And it&apos;s quite likely there will be a confirmation email buried somewhere in your inbox from that service - so all the hacker has to do is search for that service (Amazon? eBay? iTunes?) in your email, then go there and demand a password reset - which will land in the inbox they control.“You can try and operate multiple email accounts,” suggests Ferguson. “Some email services allow you to create disposable email addresses that are relatively easy to manage.”He explains: “You could have an address that is bespoke to eBay, for instance with something like eBay.yourname@emailprovider.co.uk or paypal.yourname etc, so if that account is compromised you can just throw it away and create a new one.”Another option is to create several layers of email addresses, using one for low security accounts, one for medium and another exclusively for banking or other crucial financial services.Fake those security questionsMany sites and services require “secret” answers to questions like “who was your first teacher?” or “what is your mother’s maiden name?” There is nothing inherently wrong with the idea of secret questions to verify your identity as long as they actually stay secret.Wherever possible, pick and choose to write your own secret question, and give an answer that is unique to each service. This can be hard to do if you do it at random. Try using something about the site to fill it in. So if you&apos;re on &quot;Randomsite.com&quot; and it asks you what the name of your first pet was, why not say Randomsite? Or Etismodnar? Or Rando, or Etism. The important thing is to be consistent. (You might even consider going back to sites where you have already filled this in and changing them to match your pattern.)The advantage of this method is that if the sites are doing the right thing, and encrypting your answers (and then encrypting future responses, and comparing the saved and latest responses to see if the results match), then even if hackers do grab the information and decrypt it, it will make little sense. Most hackers try the results they get from any password or other hack on multiple sites - that&apos;s why it&apos;s dangerous to use the same email/password combination on multiple sites.Faking information can be particularly important when it comes to easy-to-find information like your mother’s maiden name or your father’s middle name (both of which could be available on the electoral register, for instance).Use a secure password managersThe problem comes when trying to remember all this fake or varied information, but there are storage solutions that offer to securely store passwords and other important information.“Look at password management software,” suggests Ferguson. “There are a load of options out there and it does mean that you can at least confine risks to individual accounts with unique passwords when they are breached.”Password managers like LastPass or 1Password offer to store more than just passwords. Individual logins for internet accounts can have other information such as your fake secret passwords, date of birth or postcode attached to them. That way it is simply a case of looking up the information when you need it.Most of the good password manager services also provide multiple ways to access the information, via a mobile app, website or offline for instance, as well as multiple layers of security, including two-factor authentication.It is extremely important to ensure that your password manager account is as protected as possible with a bullet-proof password, which should be as long and complex you are capable of remembering.It also creates a layer of inconvenience when you want to login to each service that one login and password for everything eliminates, but it will all be worth it when one of your accounts like eBay is broken into.As Ferguson says, “effective security is no longer about designing architecture with the aim of keeping the attacker out permanently, that’s a pipe dream. If they want to get in, they will get in.”These days it is inevitable that one or more services you use will get hacked at some stage or another, and so preparing yourself for that attack could mean the difference between a simple password change and having to cancel cards and change passwords everywhere.•What to do if your email gets hacked and how to stop it happening again
In the cold vacuum of space, miles above the planet surface, I am guiding my tiny space ship toward the airlock of another vessel. To dock, our orbits have to align precisely, but the variables are terrifying. I have built the craft myself, out of myriad components, and I don’t know if it’ll hold up out here in the vast indifferent nothingness.I progress forward anyway, nudging the thrusters with just enough vigour to connect with the airlock, but not enough to cause a mid-flight collision that will end the lives of my crew. In space, there is always risk and reward. The reward for me is to stay alive – and to get home.The fortunate part is that, actually, I am at home. I am on a computer playing a game called Kerbal Space Program. And there’s always another spacecraft to build and crash.Fantasy v simulationVideo games are obsessed with space travel. From the seminal 1961 title SpaceWar – one of the first games ever made – to modern science fiction odysseys like Mass Effect and Halo, the idea of exploring distant galaxies has proved incredibly seductive.But authentic space simulators, offering a purer, more complex and authentic interactive experience, are much rarer. Since Apollo 18 hit the Commodore 64 in 1987, there have been a couple of dozen maybe, often produced by small teams writing for dedicated fans. Microsoft’s 1994 title Space Simulator was one of the most notable examples, incorporating an array of astrodynamic space mechanics, but the company never produced a sequel. The industry moved on."Okay, where does the spoiler go?"But then in 2011 a development studio based in Mexico released an early version of Kerbal Space Program, an intricately detailed space flight sim for Windows and Mac. Here, the player’s aim is simple; design and construct spacecraft in your own personal space center.As you succeed with flight missions, you’ll accrue more funding and expand your expertise, but the game also acts as completely free sandbox experience with myriad options for inventive design. The possibilities for construction are almost endless, and the most experienced players are able to dock craft in orbit to create space stations, land on the nearby moon, and venture into deep space. It&apos;s no wonder people are calling this Minecraft in space – it has that same sense of creativity and possibility.The community rises, Nasa noticesAnd as with Minecraft, a community quickly grew around Kerbal, despite its unfinished state. Users began modifying the code and adding new features, and when it was released onto leading PC games platform Steam in spring 2013, it became one of the top five best-selling titles on the site’s “early access” section – a huge new audience joined the experiment. Felipe Falanghe, Kerbal’s creator and lead developer at Squad, has perhaps been surprised by the success of the title, but understands its appeal. “It’s about seeing your creations explode and trying to figure out why,” he says. “It’s about how you can improve the design so it doesn’t happen again” he says. “It’s about exploring and reaching out to something that was a complete unknown not too long ago.”The success of the game hadn’t gone unnoticed. In March 2013, Squad received an intriguing tweet: “Interested in exploring an asteroid with us?” It was from Nasa, and after a year of cooperation, the Kerbal team was able to implement the real-life Asteroid Redirect Mission into its game. Players can now experiment with a genuine space programme, using Nasa rocket parts. “It’s been a truly amazing experience,” says Falanghe. “When we first started, we had very little help from experts, save what we could research on our own. For us, it was a great learning experience – none of us in the team have any formal background in aerospace or any related field.”Public relations for space travelFor Nasa, there was another motive. The public relations boom of the moon landings and the 1980s shuttle programme has long faded, and amid a biting recession, there is apathy and misunderstanding about the organisation. The American public doesn’t just lack understanding about what Nasa undertakes, it also grossly overestimates the budget it receives from the US government. As recently as 1997, the public estimated that up to 20% of government budget was allocated to Nasa – a $328bn injection that would almost certainly have meant a successful manned Mars mission by now. In truth, Nasa has requested a budget of$17.5bn for fiscal 2015. Of that, just $89m is allocated to educating the next generation of astronauts, scientists and engineers.“I think it’s a shame,” says Falanghe, “not just for Nasa but for mankind in general, that there isn’t as much interest in space exploration these days as there should be. Reaching for the stars should be the next step for us as a species, especially as we’re so obviously exceeding the current resources the Earth has to offer.”The sim allows you to build a variety of spacecraft, from rockets to satellites.But Nasa is fighting back. Using sites like Facebook, Twitter and its ownNasa TV digital channel, it is building connections with the younger generation, explaining its projects, posting videos and live streams and designing interactive applications around its satellite and Mars Rover initiatives. “As we continue to become more connected through social media, public ignorance of public and private space exploration missions has shrunk” says David Lantz, a flight controller directly inside Nasa’s mission control. “With over 4 million people watching the last launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis and 3.2 million watching the landing of Mars Curiosity rover through various digital outlets, I’d say interest and desire has never been higher.&quot;Why astronauts play space gamesJoining up with Kerbal Space Program has been part of this. As Nasa develops plans to land men on an asteroid by 2025, and with a manned mission to Mars tentatively slated for launch in the early 2020s, it’s even possible we might see games giving real-time access to content, providing a sense of what it’s like to venture onto other worlds. It’s not just about providing PR to a space industry, it’s about interesting gamers in aeronautics as a viable career. “I remember playing an old simulator called Shuttle in the early 90s and then flying a shuttle in the flight simulator, X-Plane,” says Lantz. “I recall being amazed at the quality of the games and surprised at the updated graphics. I can’t help but see newer generations being inspired to go and explore as these simulators continue to follow Moore’s law”.Can space flight sims really inspire a new generation of jet propulsion physicists and systems engineers? Thomas Pedersen, PhD is lead space strategist at Copenhagen Suborbitals, a non-profit aerospace organisation founded almost as a hobbyist venutre by Kristian von Bengtson and Peter Madsen. Since 2008, the organisation has launched several rockets, funded partly by corporate sponsorship and partly by a group of around 1,000 supporters. There was definitely something game-like about the way the outfit started. “What is more challenging that starting out completely from scratch, two men with a simple sheet metal workshop at hand and the ambition to send a man on a suborbital trajectory into space?” asks Pedersen.For him, games have been a key inspiration in his career, not just the worthy simulations, but the more fantastical adventures of galactic exploration. “Games have gone far beyond [real life] for decades – ever since David Braben’s classic, Elite,” he says. “Ah, those memories. Perhaps Elite is why I am where I am today”Sean Lillibridge is at Nasa’s engineering design and analysis branch for advanced thermal systems. He remembers playing simulator games while growing up and insists they inspired him to consider space as a career. “MS Flight Simulator 4.0 had a mode where you could customize the flight model of a few different aircraft,” he says. “This gave me a playground to experiment with the game, specifically the way it perceived how different changes to the aircraft would manifest themselves. Eventually, I came to understand that the computer understood its ‘airplane’ in a very different way than how an airplane actually works, while still maintaining a basic, believable flight model. This got me interested inhow computers can simulate aerodynamics.Games influenced my career by showing the beginnings of what computers were capable of simulating.”Dawn of the serious space gamesWhile Kerbal is one of the most successful space simulators ever created, it’s just one of many being now being developed as educational, potentially inspirational tools. David Braben, co-creator of the space trading sim Elite, is now overseeing the development of a new titles in the series, Elite: Dangerous. He believes that this is the beginning of an important few years for games and space exploration. “Frankly the next generation of space simulation is within games.” he continues. “In Elite: Dangerous we are pulling together all the known information about our galaxy within the simulation. We don’t think that is being done anywhere else.”Other Kickstarter games, like space simulatorSpace Pioneer, are using the expert knowledge cosmonauts and spaceflight experts like Aleksandr Lazutkin to piece together a wonderful picture of space exploration. Lazutkin, a veteran cosmonaut with the Russian Federal Space Agency, has spent more than 180 days in space across his extensive career, survived a fire onboard Russian space station MIR in 1997 and a mid-space collision with the craft Progress a few years later. An impressive set of experiences.“Games have the incredible and unmatched potential to inspire and give life to future ambitions” says Lazutkin. “If a video game is made the right way it can give the player new knowledge in a way that’s unobtrusive, and that’s what we’re striving for - we think that accomplishing this and inspiring people to become space explorers is something that represents the highest echelon of game making.”Kids in spaceThe team at Kerbal certainly sees the opportunity to lead in the field of space education; to revitalise the public interest in Nasa and even to create a new generation of astronauts, cosmonauts, mission control agents and thermodynamic analysts. Games are, after all, becoming the primary medium for a new generation of digital natives, used to interacting with iPads and consoles. Television coverage of the Apollo missions may have inspired kids in the 70s, but today’s children are too busy playing Minecraft. Not that it’s a bad thing – Minecraft is teaching millions of children about architecture, urban planning, even soil mechanics. Kerbal could do the same thing for space.“We did a survey [of over] 12,000 players and more than 92 percent are not nor ever have been part of the aerospace industry,” says Falanghe. “But more than 97% of those players said Kerbal Space Program has increased their interest in science and space and over 95% of them said they learned something about astrophysics or rocket science from playing the game.”For once, it actuallyisrocket science...As a community, Kerbal Space Program’s fans are as dedicated to the mission as Squad, providing feedback and actively participating in the game’s evolution, shaping it into something that even Falanghe couldn’t have anticipated. “When we did our first public release we weren’t even sure if we would keep the orbital mechanics in the game or not, as we couldn’t be sure before if players would receive it well, or think it was too complex to be fun. It was only after we released we saw players not only liked the orbits, they wanted more of it.”It was a turning point for Kerbal, which Falanghe says was not originally intended as an authoritative simulation of space flight, complete with orbiting space stations. After feedback, the design emphasis changed entirely, and a new ethos emerged around progressive learning. With Nasa’s involvement, Squad has now teamed up with educational specialist TeacherGaming to produce KerbalEdu, a version of the game intended for classrooms, allowing teachers to create set tasks for pupils. The project is in its early stages right now, but TeacherGaming has had huge success with MinecraftEdu, bringing the game to schools around the world.From space sim to space careerA career trajectory from interested gamer to space industry expert is one that Falanghe and his team consider plausible. As Squad perfects the balance of education and game, and nurtures its relationship with space organisations around the globe, the team edges closer to that goal.It&apos;s clearly what Falanghe dreams of: “If we hear of a new generation of astronauts and engineers, and a renewed interest in space exploration, and if even one of them was inspired to pursue that career as a result of our little game. Well… that’s about as much as a game designer can hope to achieve, I think.”• David Braben on Elite, Kickstarter and Raspberry Pi• The player: In praise of educational games• How do you build a city in space?
Virtual reality headset manufacturer Oculus is being sued by publisher, ZeniMax Media. The company claims that its intellectual property, as well as the expertise of several employees, was used to develop the Oculus Rift headset, which was successfully crowd-funded on the Kickstarer site in 2012.The 46-page lawsuit, filed in Texas on Wednesday, asserts that Oculus founder Palmer Luckey was just a &quot;college-age video-game enthusiast&quot; working on a &quot;primitive virtual reality headset&quot;when he sought the help of ZeniMax employee John Carmack, one of the co-creators of Doom and widely considered to be one of the greatest programmers in the industry. Carmack was still working for ZeniMax subsidairy Id Software at the time, but allegedly started to provide vital technical assistance. The lawsuit also alleges that ZeniMax employees &quot;literally transformed the Rift by adding physical hardware components and developing specialised software for its operation.&quot;However, after the hugely successful unveiling of the Oculus Rift headset at the E3 video game exhibition in June 2012, ZeniMax claimed that Oculus ignored dozens of attempts to formalise the relationship between the two companies – it also claims that Oculus breached non-disclousre agreements by publicising its technology without permission. In 2013, John Carmack left Id Software to take up a position as chief technology officer at Oculus; ZeniMax claims he took ZeniMax IP with him, and that he poached several members of staff.The lawsuit concludes weeks of wrangling between the two companies. ZeniMax first claimedat the end of Aprilthat Carmack had taken ZeniMax technology, with the Wall Street Journalreporting on legal letters passing between the companies(subscription required). Oculus quickly denied that it had stolen ZeniMax IP or that any specific technologies developed by ZeniMax were used in the Rift headset. Inan email sent out to news sources,Oculus called the accusations &quot;disappointing&quot; and claimed that no ZenMax intellectual property, code or technology was used in the development of Rift.The lawsuit is likely to have been instigated in repsonse to Facebook&apos;s $2bn purchase of Oculus in March. The social media company has said that it will allow the VR specialist to operate with autonomy, but it is likely the company&apos;s immersive VR technology will find its way into future social networking plans. Oculus has so far sold around 100,000 developer versions of its Rift headset and plans a consumer launch later this year. The headset features a high-definition screen and motion trackers, allowing PC users to immerse themselves fully into game environments. Dozens of games already have Oculus Rift compatibility, including Id Software&apos;s Doom3.In a statementto US game site Kotaku, Oculus has once again defended itself against the accusations: &quot;The lawsuit filed by ZeniMax has no merit whatsoever. As we have previously said, ZeniMax did not contribute to any Oculus technology. Oculus will defend these claims vigorously.&quot;Certainly there are questions ZeniMax will be required to answer. The Lawsuit states that the company, &quot;invested tens of millions of dollars in research and development, including research into virtual reality and immersive technologies&quot;. It also highlights the &quot;crude&quot; state of Luckey&apos;s original prototype, which was allegedly provided with &quot;enormous technical advances&quot; by ZeniMax technicians. In which case, the company may be asked why it did not develop and launch its own VR headset, without the assistence of a university student from Southern California.The lawsuit document can be viewed below:Many industry insiders feel that virtual reality could be the next big consumer electronics trend.

A free game where you simply swipe the screen to make money that can only be spent within the game doesn’t sound all that riveting. But, surprisingly, it is – and Make it Rain could easily be the next Flappy Bird, a true viral phenomenon.The free-to-play game forApple’s iPhoneandAndroidtasks the player with making money. Happily, this doesn&apos;t involve a zero-hours contract stacking shelves. You start by simply swiping the screen, making it &quot;rain&quot; pound notes. Generate enough cash and you can start to invest your money, perhaps in something innocuous such as a lemonade stand – or throw caution to the wind and buy a corrupt politician.And it&apos;s addictive. Power begets power, money generates more money and for developer Space Inch it’s generating great wads of real money, to the tune of $50,000 a day from advertising and small in-app purchases.Brilliant mechanicsFlappy Bird was often quoted as generating $50,000 a day for developer Dong Nguyen before it was pulled from the App Store.The success of a mobile game like this hinges on simplicity and brilliant mechanics –something the Bird game got right– and it seems that a layer of humorous complexity could be the secret to Make it Rain’s success.Choose your business strategy and plan your investments carefully.There are three types of investment the player can make, each generating more and more money. “Financial investments” earn money without the need to swipe the stack of cash.Each strategic “business investment” boosts your cash flow, upgrading the rate at which you generate money by swiping the notes and making it rain.Hire a top tax lawyer and really rake it inOthers classified as “political investments” generate money while the game is closed, when you should be doing real work, rather than furiously swiping at your screen. Buying a local politician, for instance, will earn the player an extra £600,000 an hour, while hiring a top tax lawyer boosts that by £550bn an hour, a sum real tax-dodgers would give their right arm for. (However, the FBI – not the real one – does make an appearance if you get involved in dodgy dealings.)The simple swiping game mechanics hide a much more complex strategy game, which a sense of humour that Flappy Bird never offered.Swipe those £5 notes like there's no tomorrow.The game was created for $10,000 and the developers spent an additional $1,000 in marketing, which has led to the game downloaded over 220,000 times a day, racing up the apps charts, according to Joshua Segall co-founder Space Inch,talking to VentureBeat.That could be something to do with the fact that users can double their rate of earning if they share the game with friends or on Facebook, but the developer puts it down to the fact that the game is a hit with people in their 20s, and at least in the US, they&apos;re talking about it and playing it in groups, leading more and more to download it via word of mouth.Small beginnings leading to a viral explosion sounds rather familiar. Even if this isn’t the next Flappy Bird, it’s certainly a contender for most addictive game of the year, at the very least.•Flappy Bird: a new season soars to the top of the app charts
The sound of a gunshot rattled against the back of Mitch Swenson’s teeth as he sprinted across a Turkish field. If the guards had fired to scare rather than wound, the warning had its intended effect.Swenson, a 26-year-old in his final year of a creative non-fiction course at Columbia University, was utterly terrified. As he and his three accomplices pressed through a tight hole in the fence, stepping into an unexpectedly peaceful Syrian pomegranate orchard, the relief was palpable, even if it was short-lived.This was not, as Swenson describes his journey into a war zone, his “first rodeo”. In 2011, he found himself in Cairo’s Tahrir Square on the first day of the revolution that helped instigate the Arab Spring. Since then he’s visited a clutch of troubled nations: Libya, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “I&apos;ve been around men with guns before,&quot; he says.Even so, this murky night was different. “Syria is a type of conflict that humanity has never really seen before,” explains Swenson. “All of the rules are out of the window.”Travelling with rebelsFor the next 10 days he and his partners (David Axe, the founder ofWar is Boring, a blog that covers warzones, a photographer, and a local fixer) travelled with members of theSham Falcon’s Brigade, a group opposed to the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and his troops. The rebels provided transport in exchange for food and diesel fuel.Swenson and his crew were some of the few foreign journalists left in the country; the dangers were extreme. The preceding day two Spanish journalists had been kidnapped while preparing to leave the country (they were eventuallyreleased in March).During his short time in Syria, Swenson interviewed soldiers and smugglers and saw first-hand what he describes as an “all-purveying, all-consuming, merciless, heart-eating, machine of war.” But on 4 October he left. He was due to start at college the following week.War versus popstarsWhen Swenson landed in New York, he found that Syria was some way down the popular news agenda. “I heard that nine times as many people clicked on links to do with Miley Cyrus than the war,” he recalls. “When you consider what would have been more impactful, I think going to war has far greater consequence than a salacious performance by a pop star.”Swensonwrote about his experiences, but wanted to find another way to communicate something of what he had witnessed, a country riddled with chaos and psychologically pockmarked by the president’s illegal chemical attacks on his own people. How to interest an uninterested populace in this seemingly remote nation?Turning terror into a gameHe settled upon the idea of an online game. Swenson describes1,000 Days of Syria, which is freely available toplay on the internet, as “part electric literature; part newscast; and part choose-your-own-adventure.” You follow one of three narratives, that of a foreign photojournalist, a mother of two living in Daraa or a rebel youth living in Aleppo.The story is delivered in disparate chunks and, at the end of each excerpt, you make choices about what to do next: will you attempt to flee the country or stay put? How will you try to pass the time when you’re imprisoned in a dimly lit cell? Each character has three possible endings and, at times, their stories intersect.In his attempt to explain the first three years of the Syrian conflict, Swenson relies on lengthy exposition, yet the tales are at times affecting, not least because they are based upon his own experience and the experience of those he interviewed first hand in the country.Games as journalismSwenson believes that there are numerous advantages to employing an interactive medium over traditional non-interactive storytelling.“I was able to incorporate some of the details from my notebooks into the historical nonfiction aspect of the game that were not pertinent to reporting,” he says. “In that way I could tell more of a full-bodied experience of what’s going on there.”There’s also the fact that, by placing the player in the role of these characters, with a certain degree of agency, empathy and connection is built in a different way to linear media such as film and literature.The power of wordsThe writer has shied away from the use of photography or film in the game, which is entirely constructed from text. “Photographs can take away from some of the intensity,” he says. “Sometimes when I see a video of something going on in Syria it doesn’t always seem real. Descriptive text can, in some way, be a great deal more humanising. For example, even if you watch a CGI image of a child as they choke on Sarin gas, there is still a level of disconnect. But text illuminates the humanity behind everything that’s going on in a place.”Illuminating humanity is Swenson’s primary aim with the project. “I thought if I made an interactive game that explains how things unravelled it might garner some attention to a conflict that I am concerned is being forgotten, especially in the light of developments in Ukraine,” he says.“Perhaps this will be a way for people that wouldn’t be interested to engage with the conflict. If 1,000 Days of Syria can at least inform and perhaps motivate an otherwise naive few, the mission of the game will have been a success.”• 1,000 Days of Syriacan be played for free online.The Guardian&apos;s coverage of the conflict can be found in theSyria sectionof our website•Newsgame hackathon: can we make a game with no coding experience?• News as games: immoral or the future of interactive journalism?

Instead, Microsoft rolled out a Surface Pro 3 with a 12-inch screen and internals that resemble a laptop. Really, it's a laptop with a touch screen that occasionally can double as a tablet. Which, I've argued many times, is exactly the right business case for Windows 8 devices today. Tablet, convertible, whatever -- there's plausible demand from businesspeople who need a new laptop primarily for work, but want the occasional convenience of a tablet for reading and playing games and don't want to buy two devices. But the 10-inch screen of the first two Surfaces made it less than ideal as a laptop. Today's screen could fix that.After the event, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft had in fact planned to reveal a small Surface today, but CEO Satya Nadella and new devices boss Stephen Elop -- who rejoined the company when the Nokia acquisition closed last month -- thought the device didn't stand out enough from similar devices from competitors and pulled the plug.Why I'm sending back Google Glass &gt;&gt; ComputerworldMatt Lake:After three weeks of usage, I have changed my mind.

A year and a half ago, we woke up one day to see a 40% decrease in revenue and traffic to Ask MetaFilter, likely the result of ongoing Google index updates. We scoured the web and took advice of reducing ads in the hopes traffic would improve but it never really did, staying steady for several months and then periodically decreasing by smaller amounts over time.Google updates its index all the time, ostensibly in an effort to kill off spammy how-to sites and content farms. MetaFilter isn't perfect but it's neither of those things, and now it has to lay off some of its staff.

When combined with the Surface tablet, the system is shaky on your lap at best.Microsoft made light of this foible at the Surface Pro 3 announcement today, taking care to highlight how many of the assembled press and analysts were using MacBook Airs to do their liveblogs and take their notes. I was one of those people, so a substantial portion of the announcement was aimed specifically at me (and my kind). Here's a Surface tablet you can use on your lap, as you would a laptop.Challenge accepted, Microsoft! When Panos Panay and the other Microsoft execs left the stage, I stowed my MacBook Air in my bag, grabbed my Surface review unit from the cart, and found a couch.

Justin Cooke, Topshop&apos;s former marketing chief turned digital entrepreneur, launched a new &quot;multi-sensory social network&quot; on Thursday which combines photos, music and moods.Tunepics invites users to upload their images, add a soundtrack from iTunes and label their moodTunepics, which isavailable to downloadfor free for iPhone and iPad, encourages users to post ‘moments&apos; - combination of a soundtrack alongside their favourite pictures which Cooke says is “like dynamite”.Cooke has already attracted celebrity endorsements from Kate Bosworth, Paul Smith,Will.i.amand Jamie Oliver who have all posted to the platform, along with fashion brands Asos, AllSaints and Airbnb.Jamie Oliver used Tunepics to post about meatballsKate Bosworth on TunepicsPaul Smith's post on TunepicsUsers snap or upload an image, select a tune from more than 35 million preview clips on iTunes and then spin the &quot;emotion wheel&quot; – a rainbow disc reminiscent of an old vinyl record – to choose from 16 rainbow coloured emotions designed to reflect the way the user feels about an image before they upload and share on Tunepics.Cooke led several ambitious digital projects at Topshop, including a Christmas campaign featuring Kate Bosworth ‘personally’ addressing those signed up to the brand’s mailing list (Bosworth was recorded saying each of the top 100 names on the list). He believes the potential success of Tunepics will be in the combination of two key modern behaviours: a love of uploading images and of downloading and discovering new tunes.More than 500m pictures are uploaded to the internet every day, and more than 100m songs are downloaded every week. Tunepics, designed by consultancy company Innovate7 and built by AKQA, capitalises on these two prolific digital habits, says Cooke.“Sometime music can express things you can’t say or convey and for some people articulating the moment or how they feel is not an easy thing,” he explains. The idea came to him three years ago during an autumn walk; he photographed colourful autumn leaves while listening to Paolo Nutini, and had &quot;a lightbulb moment&quot; when he moved to pick out a song calledAutumn Leaves.Tunepics' weather filter Photograph: /PRCooke&apos;s attention to detail is apparent as he talks through the features of the platform: the smooth transition between previewing a song clip to buying it from iTunes, the emotion wheel that offers more than a simple ‘like’ for an event, and instant autoplay of the music clips for “a generation who don’t want to wait” (advice he was given by Will.i.am when he showed the musician an early version of the app) .Cooke was also a vice president at Burberry where he helped launch Burberry Acoustic, a music project designed to shed light on emerging British talent.“Often technology companies make products where they are focusing primarily on the tech”, says Cooke, who has used hi experience of the fashion and luxury goods industries to create a certain design sensibility around Tunepics.Comparisons with Instagram would not be unwelcome, Cooke says although he’s keen to stress that Tunepics came from a desire to create a platform that allowed for a different way that users could express themselves.“Justin has an extraordinary vision of what the future looks like and the ability to connect with people in a time when the world is primed for digital disruption,&quot; said Joanna Shields, chair of Tech City UK and UK ambassador for digital industries. &quot;London needs more digital leaders with technology fuelled success stories like his; I am confident that Tunepics is going to be one of them.”Cooke has ambitious plans for the network and says he has resisted moving to San Francisco&apos;s tech scene.“It’s the first British social network - built, made and designed in the UK,” he enthuses, “It’s really exciting”.•Lulu Guinness: &apos;Fashion designers need to be fearless about technology&apos;
Google&apos;s smart-homes firm, Nest, is to return its Protect-branded smoke alarm to the market in a few weeks.Thealarm was pulled from sale in Aprilfollowing reports that it could be accidentally deactivated, which would prevent it from sounding in the event of a fire.Nest advised users to install a software update which deactivates the &quot;Nest Wave&quot; feature, which was the cause of the bug. Once that update is installed, the smoke alarm is safe to use.On Wednesday,a press release from the US consumer product safety commission (CPSC)sparked a flurry of reports that the company was initiating a full recall of all 440,000 Nest Protects on the market.But Nest confirmed to the Guardian that the CPSC release referred to the initial warning that Nest put out in April, and that no further recall was planned.&quot;Nothing has changed since our initial announcement last month,&quot; a spokesman said, &quot;and in fact, we&apos;ll be bringing Nest Protect back on the market in a few weeks.&quot;&quot;Current customers can continue to use their Nest Protects once the Nest Wave feature has been disabled via software update. Even with the Wave feature disabled, the Nest Protect Alarm will continue to perform its essential safety functions, monitoring for increased levels of smoke and [carbon monoxide], and alerting users via voice alerts and Nest app alerts (if set up) as soon as there is a potential issue.&quot;Although the CPSC release describes Nest&apos;s decision as a &quot;recall&quot;, the body of the document refers to the same software update. &quot;Consumers who have not connected their Nest Protect devices to their wireless network and linked them to a Nest account should immediately do so,&quot; it instructs.&quot;The devices will automatically receive the update that disables the Nest Wave feature … No further action is required and consumers can continue to use their devices.&quot;The CPSC&apos;s rigorous process means that the organisation often announces recalls long after initial press reports of faults.•Nest halts sales of Protect smoke and carbon monoxide alarm on safety fears
Auction site eBay has urged users to change their passwords after suffering what may have been the biggest-ever cyber-attack when hackers broke into a database holding its 233m customers’ personal data.EBay said the breach, which was detected two weeks ago, had not given the hackers access to customers’ financial information. But it did affect a database holding encrypted passwords as well as customer names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth which were not encrypted.The site has 233 million customers worldwide, including more than 14 million active in Britain.In a statement, the auction site said that a database was compromised between late February and early March. PayPal, the payment arm of eBay, released a statement saying it was not affected and that financial information had not been compromised.“The scope for damage is absolutely huge and could be the biggest hack of all time, given the number of users eBay has,” said Rik Ferguson, global vice president of security research at security software firm Trend Micro.While financial information was protected the personal information exposed in the compromise was “neatly packaged information that is worth a lot to cybercriminals and though eBay claims that financial information was not compromised we shouldn’t be reassured by these statements,” said Professor Alan Woodward from the department of computing at the University of Surrey.“It is inexcusable for a company the size of eBay with the amount of data it holds to not encrypt all personal information held and to not constantly be at the forefront of security technology,” Ferguson agreed. “It should not have taken them three months to notice a break-in like this.”Exposure of personal information such as postal addresses and dates of birth puts users at risk of identity theft, where the data is used to claim ownership of both online and real world identities. Users are also at risk of phishing attacks from malicious third-parties, which use the private details to trick people into handing over bank account, credit card or other sensitive information.The break-in was not caused by the “Heartbleed” flaw in internet servers that received publicity this year. Instead, the hackers “compromised a small number of employee log-in credentials, allowing unauthorised access to eBay’s corporate network”, the company said.The attack is even bigger than that which affected the US retailer Target in December, when around 40m customer credit cards were stolen by hackers, who broke into the company’s systems. The fallout from that security breach led to the resignation of Target’s chief executive in May.Ebay has been described as the “golden goose” by some security researchers because of its large user base, but other internet companies yet to suffer large hacks of this nature are also considered prime targets.Amazon, for instance, has around 244m active accounts, each with credit cards attached. Apple’s iTunes – arguably the biggest database of shoppers – has around 800 million users, most of which will have credit cards attached to their accounts.“Information security and customer data protection are of paramount importance to eBay Inc, and eBay regrets any inconvenience or concern that this password reset may cause our customers,” said an eBay spokesperson.“We know our customers trust us with their information, and we take seriously our commitment to maintaining a safe, secure and trusted global marketplace.”Ebay said it is investigating the compromise working with law enforcement and security experts.“Ebay has been around for a very long time and given people’s passwords habits – keeping the same passwords for years and re-using that password on many different sites – it is more likely to have that common, old password,” said Ferguson.The company said that there had been “no evidence of the compromise resulting in unauthorised activity for eBay users, and no evidence of any unauthorised access to financial or credit card information”.Troy Gill, senior security analyst at internet security firm AppRiver said: “This breach is a stark reminder that no organisation is immune to cyberattacks.”Users will be prompted by email as well as on-site to change their passwords as a precaution, despite the stolen passwords being encrypted and showing no evidence of being compromised.Shoppers who use the same password on other sites are encouraged to change those passwords too.“It’s important that people listen to eBay and, when notified by email, change their password, as well as updating any other site which uses the same log-in credentials,” said Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm Malwarebytes.
Ebay&apos;s announcement that a database holding the personal details of users – potentially all 223 million worldwide – was hacked raises a number of serious questions.It&apos;s the biggest reported hack ever in terms of the number of people affected, but does not affect financial data, which is stored separately.Q: Do I need to change my eBay password?A:Yes. eBay is recommending this to all users.Q: But I just changed it a few weeks ago when all the Heartbleed stuff was happening. Do I really need to?A:eBay says that it discovered the hack about two weeks ago, and that it happened between &quot;late February and early March&quot;. If you haven&apos;t changed your password since then, you should.Q: What data was stolen?A:eBays says that the database with users&apos; customer names, encrypted password, email address, physical address, phone number and date of birth was breached. It hasn&apos;t said how much of that data was copied. It&apos;s best to assume that it all was.Q: Who was behind it?A:eBay hasn&apos;t said, and it&apos;s unlikely that any group would claim responsibility. But the fact that the hackers targeted eBay and its customer database suggests that they were commercially oriented, rather than an Anonymous-style &quot;hacktivist&quot; group.Q: What could someone do with that data?A:That varies from country to country, but enterprising villains could certainly use it for online identity theft.Q: Was any financial data stolen?A:eBay says not; PayPal, its payment arm, says it was not affected, and that all its information is encrypted.Q: Should I change my PayPal password?A:If you want to be ultra-cautious, yes, but make it different from your eBay one.Q: What&apos;s the biggest risk from this hack?A:The most obvious one is &quot;phishing&quot; emails pretending to be from eBay asking you to reset your password, but which direct you to a fake site that will steal your password. The problem is that eBay is going to be sending out lots of emails asking people to change their password.Normally, you can recognise a real eBay email because it contains your username in the subject line – which run-of-the-mill phishing attempts don&apos;t have. (Those tend to say something like &quot;eBay user, change your password!&quot; and should always be ignored.)But if hackers have got hold of a database with your email address and username (aka customer name), then they can format an email which will look just like the real thing – but lead you to a fake site that looks like eBay but will capture your login details.To avoid this, don&apos;t follow any links in emails that seem to come from eBay. Type the site&apos;s address into your browser. Advise your friends (and relatives) about this too: if eBay&apos;s username database has leaked to any extent, all those people are very vulnerable to phishing.Q: Do I have to changemy &quot;secret question&quot;, which is used if I can&apos;t remember my password?A:No. eBay says that this was stored separately.Q: What method was used to encrypt the passwords, and how hard will they be to decrypt?A:eBay hasn&apos;t yet answered our question on this. Internet companies use increasingly sophisticated methods to encrypt passwords; the idea is that your password should be transformed in a one-way process into a string of near-random characters. When you (or someone else) enters a password for the account, it undergoes the same processing, and the resulting strings of characters are compared. If they&apos;re the same, the password entry is accepted; if not, it&apos;s rejected.Q: Why did eBay wait two weeks before telling everyone of a break-in that happened in February?A:The company hasn&apos;t explained the timeline, but security breaches of this type typically take some time first to detect, then to determine their extent, and then to close against further hacks. It&apos;s only then that most companies announce they&apos;ve been affected.Q: Will eBay be introducing two-factor authentication (where you have to enter a code from a mobile device or previously printed list in order to log in from a previously unused device)?A:We have asked, but so far haven&apos;t received an answer. The large email suppliers (Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple) all offer &quot;2FA&quot; security, which ensures that even if someone steals your password they can&apos;t log in from a new device.
Marketing people like to talk about &quot;positioning&quot; of a new product: which existing products should their new baby be compared with (favourably, of course) so that the gawping masses can fit it into a mental matrix of &quot;things I can buy&quot;?Just briefly, let&apos;s remember the advertising schtick of a famous shampoo ad from the 1980s - the &quot;Wash &amp; Go&quot; campaign, which pretended to address those who took two bottles into the shower - shampoo and conditioner. (Possibly they needed it for their 1980s perms.) Don&apos;t bother with that,said the advert: take this one shampoo which - amazing! - combines both into one. It was a brilliant campaign.With the Surface Pro 3, announced by Microsoft on Wednesday, the company is trying to do something similar. &quot;Take a laptop and a tablet around with you?&quot; the subliminal tagline goes: &quot;With Surface you only need one bottle! I mean device!&quot;It&apos;s clear that the positioning has been significantly shifted from June 2012, when they were first announced. Microsoft isn&apos;t competing for tablet sales any more. It is defining the Surface Pro 3 (the only product officially announced this week) as a laptop competitor. Or possibly, given the offering of a docking station, as a desktop competitor.Whichever. Either is fine if you&apos;re trying to up sales of a product that has signally failed to set any part of the market on fire. Analysts estimate that Microsoft shipped about 2m Surfaces in 2013.Microsoft&apos;s blog post introducing the Surface Pro 3is full of comparisons - but none of them is with named tablets. Instead, Apple&apos;s MacBook Pro and Air get a lot of namechecks (at 0.36in thick, the Pro 3 is half the thickness of a MacBook Pro, and 30% thinner than a MacBook Air - the latter at its thickest point). Weight comparison? MacBook Air, not iPad Air.The constant mentions of Apple by Microsoft on Wednesday might seem a little strange when you consider that, despite everything, the latter still only has about 5% of all PC sales. But there are a couple of reasons why Microsoft wouldn&apos;t mention a Windows laptop as the potential replacement. First, it doesn&apos;t want to diss its OEM replacements. (And it certainly wouldn&apos;t give a Chromebook airtime, because to do so would both give Google more oxygen than Microsoft would care to, while also dissing a Windows OEM - because all the Chromebook makers also make Windows PCs.)Second, Apple has a huge chunk of the laptop market for prices above $900; the MacBook Air range starts at $899/£749 for the cheapest 11in model (128GB disk, 4GB RAM, dual-core i5 processor) and carries on from there. By contrast, most PC companies are trying to compete at prices well below $800.The Surface Pro 3, though, is jostling in the uncrowded market where Apple roams. The base price for a Surface Pro 3 with 64GB storage, 4GB RAM model with a core i3 is $799/£639 inc VAT - but that doesn&apos;t get you a Type Cover (nor a Touch Cover, which seems to be missing in action).Obviously, if you&apos;re creating a laptop replacement where you take maximum advantage of portability, you don&apos;t want to be lugging a wireless keyboard around. You might have a spare keyboard at either end of your journey (work and home) and just use the Surface as a tablet in the meantime, but if you really want a laptop replacement then you want a keyboard you can take with you.So that&apos;s another $130/£110 for the Type Cover - which means the bill for your lowest-spec Surface Pro 3 laptop replacement is $929/£749. Improve the specs any further (say, a 128GB drive, for which you have to also get an i5 processor) and you&apos;re looking at $999/£849 - plus of course that Type Cover, which means a price tag of $1,129/£959.No surprise that it&apos;s pricier than a MacBook Air - it&apos;s got a higher-resolution screen, with touch to boot - but the price tag alone will mean that it&apos;s out of the consideration for the majority of buyers.Stephen Baker, of the retail analysis group NPD,commented on Twitterthat &quot;US consumers want 13in and above notebooks (and really prefer 15in) form factor, and 7in tablets.&quot; But, he also noted, &quot;Surface units [sales] compare favourably to Chromebook [sales] and 11in MacBook Air [sales].&quot;But his point was that PC companies don&apos;t bother with those sectors. &quot;They don&apos;t make them because they don&apos;t sell.&quot;&apos;How can we get a slice of that action?Nor, in general, do touch screens on PCs - which might strike some as odd, given the number of people you see using slot-in keyboards to do work on iPads, and happily swiping the screen. People at Microsoft must see them and think: how can we get a slice of that action?Obviously, they tell themselves, the answer is to position the Surface Pro 3 as a MacBook Air replacement. This slightly overlooks the reason why those people are using iPads with keyboards: because the iPad is very portable (even with a keyboard), has a long battery life, can do the tasks people want to do, and isn&apos;t too expensive.Setting the Surface Pro 3 up against the MacBook Air might seem sensible. But is it likely that people who were considering buying a 13in MacBook Air are really going to say &quot;hmm, I could have this or I could buy a Surface Pro 3 - what shall it be?&quot;The price difference - once you factor in the Type Cover - isn&apos;t in Microsoft&apos;s favour. The Surface Pro 3 has the better screen resolution, but I suspect that people considering a MacBook Air are doing so because they want an Apple product; if they wanted Windows then there are plenty of cheaper laptops.That, in brief, is the Surface&apos;s entire problem. It&apos;s pricey; it offers a feature (portability) that other cheaper devices (laptops, tablets) already have; there&apos;s no clear demand for the combined features that it does offer (touchscreen, Windows compatibility) at the price at which it goes.Inverted disruptionTo those who think that the Surface is going to disrupt the PC market, by persuading all those foolish people who have been - like some 1990s footballer in a shampoo advert - taking two device around with them, it&apos;s worth turning the situation on its head.What if the laptop and tablet had never been invented, and every device being sold was the Surface? What then if some smart-alec came along and began offering tablets like the iPad, and laptops?Classic disruption theory,as promulgated by Clayton Christensen, tells us that it happens by cheaper, less-capable entrants moving into a market. Even though they might not be as capable at everything, they can do enough of the things that people want - possibly in a new way - to make them preferable over the things that are already on sale.Now imagine peoples&apos; reaction on first seeing a non-touch laptop that&apos;s far cheaper than a Surface. They&apos;d probably say: well, it&apos;s a bit heavier but it&apos;s portable, the screen stays at any angle, it&apos;s easier to use on your lap because of the big platter of the main body, and it&apos;s cheap, and it runs Windows programs. Doesn&apos;t do touch? That&apos;s a pity, but the price saving and convenience is more than worth it, and the battery life is comparable.Imagine that at the same time, those people were offered touch-based tablets with lots of available apps -including Office- which sold for far less than the Surface, and were lighter, and had better battery life. They&apos;d probably say: the lack of Windows is a pity, but at least it&apos;s got Office, and it&apos;s much cheaper, and lighter, and the battery life is great.In that situation, you&apos;d expect that you&apos;d see widescale disruption of sales of the Surface as people opted for the cheaper things which did much the same job. They wouldn&apos;t mind too much that they didn&apos;t do all the things the Surface did; they&apos;d like them for their sufficiency.But, you say, that&apos;s not the situation at all! It&apos;s the Surface that is coming in and trying to disrupt the incumbents.Indeed it is - but that reversal analysis tells you all you need to know about why the Surface&apos;s appeal will remain niche. It&apos;s great that Microsoft has got businesses such as BMW, the Coca-Cola Company and LVMH, which are &quot;in some cases planning to use it as a laptop replacement and in others looking at innovative ways to leverage its unique capabilities as a powerful tablet too&quot;. But as laptop replacements go, those are pretty pricey; and if we&apos;re getting into capabilities as a &quot;powerful tablet&quot;, that must be something to do with running Windows apps, which haven&apos;t yet shown much promise in the tablet format. Those will probably be LOB (line of business, ie custom-written) apps.None of this suggests that the Surface Pro 3 will be any more of a breakout product than the two previous generations.Update:some people have suggested (on Twitter) that the Surface Pro 3 will find eager buyers among graphic artists and those using some CAD/CAM software because of its new pressure-sensitive screen, which usesNtrig technology, rather than Wacom&apos;s, in combination with the active pen it comes with. That&apos;s certainly a good argument; the Surface Pro range has found some fans among those users. However, they&apos;re not a large enough group to make this a breakout product; they&apos;re a (highly motivated) niche. The Surface Pro 3 may well attract more of them through its portability and screen quality. But consumers are a different proposition.&quot;Not sure consumers want a 12in tablet,&quot; Baker mused on Twitter. Wouldn&apos;t they if it&apos;s a genuine PC replacement, retorted someone. &quot;Not for $1,000 they don&apos;t,&quot; shot back Baker. &quot;Great niche product, but will never sell in large quantities.&quot;That pretty much wraps it up. There was also the notable absence of a touch-optimised version of Office for Surface; and the lack of anything running Windows RT. The expectation now is that RT will be allowed to die a quiet and unmourned death as Intel improves the power efficiency of its processors, while Nokia - owned now by Microsoft of course - can make big ARM-based devices. You can probably make phone calls on them too.But the Surface? It&apos;s too expensive and doesn&apos;t offer anything that you can&apos;t split out into equally useful devices for less money; and it doesn&apos;t offer anything unique through being combined. You have to admire Microsoft&apos;s persistence, but this doesn&apos;t seem to be the innovation that the market is looking for. (PS: a new blade on a fan isn&apos;t sufficient innovation to make someone buy a tablet-laptop combo.) The last time I looked in the family shower, there were separate bottles of shampoo and conditioner. Some things make better tag lines than real-world scenarios.•Microsoft Surface is still losing money, figures show
It&apos;s time for our weekly roundup of the best new iPhone and iPad apps and games to have emerged on Apple&apos;s App Store.As ever, prices are correct at the time of writing, but may have changed by the time you read this.

Retailer Marks and Spencer is the latest trying its hand at a cooking app, with searchable recipes, step-by-step instructions and a built-in timer feature to help you get dishes just so.iPhone / iPadSwarm by Foursquare (Free)Social location app Foursquare has split into two apps: the main Foursquare is more of a city-guide these days, while the check-ins and mayorships and find-your-friends aspects that made its name have been spun out into Swarm. It’s neat and quick to use, but as ever, its usefulness relies on having enough friends using it.iPhonedeadmau5 (Free + IAP)Dance star deadmau5 is trying something new: a subscription-based app that promises fans exclusive music, live video streams and the chance to chat with the (not always) mouse-headed man himself. It&apos;s part of his existing online community for fans, with plenty of content to explore.iPhoneSago Mini Space Explorer (£1.99)Sago Sago is the preschool arm of top children&apos;s apps developer Toca Boca. This is its latest exploring app, which sees Harvey the dog (who&apos;ll be familiar to kids who&apos;ve played other apps by the company) zooming through space meeting aliens, robots and farting planets alike. Fun and full of character.iPhone / iPadSilent Text 2 (Free)Iwrote about Silent Text 2 at more lengthearlier in the week: it&apos;s a rewritten version of Silent Text, the secure messaging app from security firm Silent Circle. You can ping text messages and file attachments to friends, with the app encrypting them throughout the process. The company says it&apos;s slicker and more secure than the previous version.iPhoneThe Sugar Detox Diet (£1.99)Sugar is in the news a lot at the moment, in health stories that aren&apos;t good news for anyone with a sweet tooth. This is an app from book publisher Random House: 50 low-sugar recipes and a four-week &quot;detox&quot; programme to wean you off sugary habits and keep your blood sugar levels steady.iPhone / iPadLeafsnap UK (Free)If you spend a lot of time wandering around looking at trees – and heaven knows, it&apos;s better for you than sitting down looking at a screen – Leafsnap is well worth downloading. The Natural History Museum is involved: it&apos;s an app for recognising trees from photographs that you&apos;ve taken of their leaves. It claims to be able to identify 156 different species across the UK.iPhoneThe Funeral - an appnovel (£3.99)I&apos;m always a sucker for people trying to do something interesting with the interactive novel format.

This app is for anglers wanting a handy smartphone way to log their catches; share their proud, fish-hugging photos; get an insight into where other people are fishing nearby, and keep tabs on a range of weather-related attributes when deciding where they should cast their lines. The in-app purchase is for a subscription to the FishBrain service.iPhonePaperbag (£0.69)My search for the perfect shopping list app goes on: one that learns what I buy every week until it knows 90% of my list without me having to enter it again, let alone scribble it on a piece of paper. Paperbag looks like it has potential: a neat &quot;shopping assistant&quot; that learns your habits, lets you re-use old lists, and even reminds you to use your old plastic bags.iPhoneThomas Was Alone for iPad.GAMESThomas Was Alone (£5.99)Lots of people are getting very excited about the iPad version of Thomas Was Alone, which has already been a hit as a game for browsers, PCs and PS3 / PS Vita. It sees you bouncing your way through a platform game as a rectangle (yes, named Thomas), but with a proper story around it. Wonderful.iPadTable Tennis Touch (£2.49 + IAP)It doesn&apos;t sound like it should work: table tennis played with a touchscreen. But in this game, it works beautifully: fast, idiot-proof controls, a long-lasting career mode and some very fun mini-games. It&apos;s really good fun: one of those games you think you&apos;ll just dip into every so often, but find yourself playing compulsively on the sofa.iPhone / iPadAtom Run (£1.99)More platforming, although for this rectangles are out and robots are in. It&apos;s the work of developer Fingerlab, which is better known for its very slick music-making apps. Here, you&apos;re racing along as Elgo the robo-prototype, looking for atoms and molecules. The controls work well, and the soundtrack (perhaps unsurprisingly) is a hit.iPhone / iPadMaleficent Free Fall (Free + IAP)Anything Bejeweled can do, Disney can do… Well, it can do it as well. This is a match-three puzzle game based on Disney’s Maleficent film, as you swap gems and trigger combos while working your way through the storyline. In-app purchases, as ever for this genre in recent times, are used for power-ups.iPhone / iPadDarkin (£1.99)There are quite a few puzzle-RPG games for iOS now, and it&apos;s hard to stand out from what&apos;s gone before. Darkin is really good though: a vampire theme as you match three or more tiles, unlock new skills and explore the three game modes. If you&apos;re a fan of the genre, it&apos;s well worth buying.iPhone / iPadKnights of Puzzelot (Free + IAP)What was that about puzzle-RPG games? Knights of Puzzelot is another one, from Glu Games: a familiar mixture of monsters, loot and match-three mechanics. You can craft your own sets of items, and build up a town in the background that helps you progress. Again, definitely worth trying if you like this kind of game.iPhone / iPadGlorious Maximus (£1.49)What did the Romans ever do for us? This is a fighty cartoon action game with 30 levels to batter your way through, looting and upgrading your characters as you go. There’s good scope for different battling strategies with the various characters.iPhone / iPadTransport Empire (Free + IAP)The success of Transport Tycoon showed there&apos;s an appetite for transport strategy games on touchscreen devices. Transport Empire, with its free-to-play model, could find a bigger audience I suspect. It&apos;s a Victorian-steampunk game where you build railroads, boats, planes and roads to get people around, building a virtual business.iPhone / iPadRecord of Agarest War (£10.49)This is expensive, and niche here in the west: a tactical Japanese roleplaying game that will delight fans of the genre, and probably never register with anyone else. Still, if you like your tactical fantasy battlers, you&apos;ll love this: masses of game to explore, spells, monsters and skills galore to tune your fighting strategy.iPhone / iPadAxl &amp; Tuna (£0.69)Finally, a colourful endless runner that&apos;s got enough charm to rise above the herds of mobile games in that genre. It sees you racing down tracks jumping, flipping and falling to get the highest scores possible. It&apos;s bright, sparkly and very diverting.iPhone / iPadBONUS WEB-APPSpell Up (Free)Spell Up isn’t a native app, it’s a “Chrome Experiment” developed by Google, which can be played on computers, smartphones and tablets. It’s a game based on learning English, spelling the words that you hear, building towers of letters as you go. Innovative, and fun. And while it&apos;s designed more for Android, it also works on iOS.Those are our picks, but what have you been enjoying on iOS this week? Post your recommendations (or feedback on these) in the comments section.
Anonymous messaging app Secret is expanding worldwide, less than a month after it became available outside the US for the first time.The app lets users share short text and image posts to friends and the broader community completely anonymously, and has been described as &quot;Twitter without usernames&quot;. Users&apos; friends are pulled automatically from their address book, but posts and comments are not linked message-to-message.From Wednesday, the app will be available to download anywhere in the world, although without localisation for specific languages, it will only be useful for users who can speak English.&quot;We&apos;re getting so much demand that we don&apos;t see the point in holding it back,&quot; explains co-founder Chrys Bader. The app launched in the UK in April, alongside Ireland and Australasia, and Bader says that success in those areas motivated the company to push forward plans for going worldwide.&quot;It definitely validated the international expansion. It gave us a different perspective: Our users were interacting across countries, and it was very interesting to see.&quot;&quot;I think that we&apos;re particularly interested in Brazil, and curious to see how Japan uses it. But, really, now everyone in the world has an app for this, and I&apos;m really excited to see how Secret thrives in all these different cultures.&quot;The appis also coming to Android for the first time, complete with new features exclusively for the Google-owned operating system. The Android version will split Secret&apos;s monolithic feed in two: one will show updates from friends, while the other, named &quot;explore&quot;, will show the best posts from around the world.&quot;We wanted to show that Android can have new features first,&quot; Bader told the Guardian. &quot;And we wanted to reward them for waiting all this time.&quot; The Android development is led by Sara Haider, one of Secret&apos;s highest-profile new hires who was poached from Twitter in mid-March.While Bader confirms that those features will probably be added to iOS at some point, Apple&apos;s platform isn&apos;t left out in the cold. A new feature that will hit both platforms simultaneously encourages users to share specific facts about themselves.&quot;We were calling them icebreakers internally. One we had recently asked &apos;What&apos;s the last lie that you told?&apos; We&apos;re trying to give people more stuff to share.&quot;Once users have answered, they can push the same question to their friends, to encourage them to share too – all anonymously, of course.The feature should overcome an initial difficulty new users report, which is trying to work out information just unspecific enough to avoid identifying the speaker, but still juicy enough to be worth sharing. &quot;It also gives our community team something to interact with,&quot; says Bader, pointing out that the app as it stands offers few chances for interaction between the users and Secret itself.Other changes will tackle some of the obfuscation necessary to make Secret work. Currently, users can&apos;t see their friends list to prevent them reverse-engineering who exactly is sending particular messages; that secrecy goes so far as preventing them from seeing how many friends they have, beyond certain thresholds. Some of those restrictions are being lifted, and users will now see simple information about their followers incorporated into their stream.&quot;We definitely walk a fine line [between ease of use and obfuscation], because given the nature of how it works, you need to make sure that no-one can pinpoint who you are,&quot; says Bader. &quot;But how do you explain that to users? We&apos;re constantly trying to make it make sense.&quot;•Secret answers accusations of bullying
Apple’srumoured $3.2bn acquisition of Beats headphonesis turning into a lawsuit magnet.Steven Lamar, a former hedge fund manager, founder of Jibe Audio and co-founder of Beats has filed a lawsuit against Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine stating breach of contract and demanding as much as 4% royalties on headphones sales.“Lamar&apos;s concept envisioned a partnership between technology that would provide a superior audio experience and an iconic product design and brand identity promoted by a well-known and respected music artist,&quot; states Lamar&apos;scross-complaintfiled with the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles. &quot;Iovine proposed that Dre be the celebrity musical artist to endorse the headphones.&quot;The case wasfirst reported by the Hollywood Reporter. It&apos;s the second lawsuit Beats has faced since the news of a possible acquisition by Apple surfaced. David Hyman, former Beats chief executive and Mog music service founder which Beats acquired in 2012,filed a suit for $20m in Mayclaiming that he was hired and deliberately fired before he could collect his equity grant owed from the Mog purchase.‘Father of Beats’Lamar, the self-proclaimed founder of Beats, has beendescribed as the real “Father of Beats”by Mike Klasco, an audio engineer who worked on the original version of the headphones. Lamar also claims to have had the idea of celebrity-endorsed headphones, which propelled Beats to the forefront of headphones brands.In 2006, Lamar worked with Robert Brunner, the former director of industrial design at Apple and a parter of the Pentagram design company at the time, to come up with the big, bold design of the first set of Beats headphones, which have formed the basis of designs for the majority of the company’s later models.The cross-complaint describes Lamar as “the founder of Beats headphones, its design and corporate identity” and argues that his royalty entitlement should include future models of Beats with a design similar to the originals, instead of just a subset of the original design.Beats and Apple’s history started in 2006The document also details a meeting between Lamar and Jerry McDougal, Apple’s vice president of retail, in 2006 where Lamar presented the company’s first three headphones and proposed to sell Beats directly through Apple’s retail stores, marking Beats’ first meeting with Apple.McDougal then introduced Lamar to Don Inmon who was responsible for product placement in Apple stores, leading the two to work on the correct packaging size for Beats headphones to be compatible with Apple’s store displays.Ultimately Beats chose cable supplier Monster over Apple to be sole distributor of Beats headphones, with the deal seeing Dre and Iovine getting a 20% royalty on all sales, and Lamar a 5% cut. Beatseventually fell out with Monster.Rows from the offIn 2006 Dre and Iovine later filed a suit against Lamar - who was reported at the time to be unhappy with his royalty deal – and his company SLS International, claiming breach of an oral contract and attempting to create headphones very similar to Beats without their involvement. The suit was quickly settled, resulting in Lamar being paid a 4% royalty on some of Beats headphone sales.That royalty was to be split between Pentagram and Lamar. But Lamar claimsin the new complaint that “Brunner surreptitiously negotiated a separate agreement with Iovine, Dre, and/or Beats Electronics for monetary compensation” and “effectively cut Jibe and Lamar out of the royalty stream” for the so-called “covered headphones” design. He is demanding a trial by jury.Beats Electronics declined to comment on the suit.•What does Apple stand to gain from a Beats acquisition?
As a kid, Mike Bithell wasn&apos;t allowed to play video games. Well, not the video games his friends were playing – his parents didn&apos;t approve. Consequently, the formative gaming experiences of this hugely successful &quot;indie&quot; developer were with educational titles. Except that one time his Dad smuggled Doom into the house.A decade or so later, Bithell has released the hit platformer Thomas Was Alone and is currently developing his second game, Volume. We invited him into the Guardian office just as the iPad version of Thomas was hitting the App Store, and wanted to find out how this charming title developed from a Flash game made in 24 hours to a million-selling PC and PlayStation hit.Along the way, Bithell tells us about the creative process, about how he managed to get Danny Wallace to provide the voice-over for Thomas, and why he&apos;s so fascinated with Robin Hood. He also admits that what drove him from working in a games studio toward developing his own games was jealously. Or more precisely, jealousy over the success of indie hits like World of Goo. &quot;I found out about how the developers of that game had quit their jobs, and had become successful enough to do what they wanted. That sounded cool. Especially to a junior designer. I had the arrogance that is only available to 23-year-olds...&quot;Here&apos;s the whole chat:Keith Stuart talks to game designer Mike Bithell
This week on Tech Weekly withAleks Krotoskiwe hear from leading UK indie games creatorMike Bithell.  Mike discusses his hit gameThomas Was Aloneand how he persuaded writer and actorDanny Wallaceto be the voice of the game. On the show we have an extract of the interview butyou can hear it in full by going to our Soundcloud page.Also on this weeks show Aleks is joined by Guardian technology correspondentCharles Arthur, tech writerSamuel Gibbsand Guardian games editorKeith Stuartto discuss Google's bid to buy games streaming service Twitch, the rise of the Phablet outside of Asia and the implications for search engines in light of the new EU law that enshrines the right to be forgotten online.
Its critics include Thom Yorke and Johnny Marr, but music streaming service Spotify has become an established industry fixture that poses a competitive threat to headline technology acts like Apple.The announcement by the Swedish music streaming service that it has 10 million paying subscribers and 40 million active monthly userswill further excite US investors who are anticipating a flotation this year.Despite its detractors, Spotify’s growth confirms that the music-listening public likes the model of paying a monthly subscription – of £10, $10 or €10 – for unlimited access to tens of millions of tracks. The company has leapt from 24 million active users and 6 million paying subscribers in March last year and is the world’s biggest music subscription service.“We’ve had an amazing year, growing from 20 markets to 56 as people from around the world embrace streaming music,” said chief executive Daniel Ek in a statement. “Ten million subscribers is an important milestone for both Spotify and the entire music industry. We’re widening our lead in the digital music space and will continue to focus on getting everyone in the world to listen to more music.”Spotify also announced that its users have created 1.5bn music playlists; that Avicii’s Wake Me Up is its most-streamed song with 235m plays; and that David Guetta is its most-followed artist, with 5m fans subscribed to his updates on the service.The service now has a clear lead ahead of fellow music upstarts. Its rivals in the streaming music market include Deezer, which has 12 million active users and 5 million paying subscribers, and Rhapsody, which has 1.7 million paying subscribers around the world, split between its Rhapsody and Napster brands.But it is the bigger rivals, which have noted Spotify’s success, that pose the main threat. Beats Music in the US is not bigger – it launched in January – but its likely new parent is a problem. Beats Music’s owner, headphones firm Beats Electronic, is close to being acquired by Apple for $3.2bn (£1.9bn). Apple’s streaming music ambitions represent one of the biggest challenges to Spotify. Its iTunes Radio service – which streams personalised “stations” but does not allow users to choose individual songs unlike Spotify – is already available in the US and Australia with more countries, including the UK, expected to follow later this year.Meanwhile, YouTube is also expected to launch a subscription music service in the near future, although it is already the biggest online source of free streaming music. So Spotify may look good money for its mooted $4bn valuation in the wake of Wednesday’s figures, but it faces several key challenges to its business in the months and years ahead:1. Winning over musician sceptics in the musicianSome prominent musicians don&apos;t like Spotify at all.Thom Yorke called the company &quot;the last desperate fart of a dying corpse&quot;in 2013, telling his peers that &quot;I feel like as musicians we need to fight the Spotify thing&quot;, suggesting that the company is just another (unwanted) middleman in the music industry.&quot;All these fuckers get in a way, like Spotify suddenly trying to become the gatekeepers to the whole process. We don&apos;t need you to do it. No artists needs you to do it. We can build the shit ourselves, so fuck off.&quot;David Byrne was more measured, but just as criticalin an article for The Guardian shortly afterwards. &quot;It seems to me that the whole model is unsustainable as a means of supporting creative work of any kind,&quot; he wrote. &quot;What&apos;s at stake is not so much the survival of artists like me, but that of emerging artists and those who have only a few records under their belts.&quot;There are various reasons some musicians don&apos;t like Spotify, although the company is something of a lightning rod for criticism of all streaming services. Some criticise the size of per-stream payouts compared to the money they receive for sales of CDs and downloads, or plays of their music on the radio.Others think that streaming funnels money towards the biggest stars and doesn&apos;t support emerging acts. And others simply distrust Spotify because major labels own a chunk of the business, and they don&apos;t think they&apos;ll get a fair share of advance payments made to those labels, as well as any profits if and when the company is either bought or floats on the stock market.Others are taking a more pragmatic – but still problematic for Spotify – approach of withholding their new albums until they&apos;ve had a few months of sales on CD and download stores like Apple&apos;s iTunes.Coldplay, the Black Keys and Beyoncé are the three latest high-profile artiststo adopt this approach, following Adele and Taylor Swift in previous years.Spotify has tried to tackle all this in several ways. Itlaunched a Spotify Artists websitein December 2013 to explain how it calculates its payouts – including making it clear that it pays labels and publishers but can&apos;t make them more transparent about how they pass that money on to creators.It has also highlighted the success (in terms of streams and sales) of big artists like One Direction and Bruno Mars, whose last albums launched day-and-date on iTunes and Spotify, while launching new features to help artists sell merchandise and tickets from within its service.Spotify also has its supporters within the musician community.Billy Bragg launched his own &quot;talking playlists&quot; showon Spotify in February, and defended the company from attacks by artists. &quot;Let’s not attack the platform: they’re making a lot of money, but they’re paying out a lot of money too,&quot; he said. &quot;It’s where the money is going to: the people who are collectively referred to as the rightsholders.&quot;Meanwhile, Metallica and Pink Floyd – both formerly streaming music holdouts – have added their back catalogue to Spotify in recent times.2. Turning a profit from streaming musicStreaming music is a tough business, to say the least. Companies like Spotify pay out 70% of their revenues in royalties, spending the rest (and a lot more) on running their services, expanding globally and the other costs involved in a modern digital business.Spotify sees the $1bn that it has paid out to rightsholders since 2008 as a positive thing: a sign that it&apos;s adding value to the music industry. But that also means the company remains heavily lossmaking: €45.4m of net losses in 2011, €58.7m in 2012 and possibly more in 2013 – those figures haven&apos;t been announced yet.The argument in point one about whether Spotify is sustainable for artists is important, but so is the question of whether it is sustainable for itself. Thus far, the company has been fuelled by massive venture capital funding rounds – $537.8m so far, including a $250m round in November 2013. That valued Spotify at $4bn, with rumours of an IPO this autumn continuing to bubble away.Investors may not expect Spotify to be making a profit yet, but with no existing business in hardware (Apple, Beats, Sony, Microsoft) or advertising (Google, YouTube) to prop it up, the company&apos;s future depends on figuring out how to reach a much bigger scale with many more paying subscribers, managing its royalty commitments, running costs and investment in new features and countries.Note: renegotiating contracts to lower those royalties is one tactic, but a risky one given the artist-payouts controversies. In the US, streaming radio firm Pandora has been attracting even more heated criticism than Spotify, partly because it has been publicly lobbying to reduce the percentage of its revenues it has to pay out in royalties.3. Appealing to a more mainstream audience40m active users is a decent number, but it&apos;s not what Spotify needs. When the company launched its Spotify Artists website, it set out a target of sorts: 40m paying subscribers – which at its current conversion rate of 25%, would mean 160m active users. Four times its current size, in other words.Spotify has done a good job of appealing to early adopters: tech-savvy music fans. Its bigger long-term challenge is how to attract a much more mainstream audience to first use its service, then pay for it – this is a challenge facing every streaming service, obviously. Spotify and streaming is already truly mainstream in its native Sweden and nearby Norway, but there&apos;s lots of work to do to make this happen elsewhere in the world.It&apos;s likely to be a mixture of marketing and partnerships – the latter particularly focused on mobile operators and ISPs (often the same company, obviously) to promote Spotify to their customers, and perhaps to bundle its premium service in with monthly contracts, so it feels cheaper. Vodafone 4G in the UK is one example, and a recent deal with Sprint in the US another.Spotify and its rivals are all pursuing such partnerships aggressively, because they see them as an important way to both reduce the price (or perceived price) of a subscription music service, while raising awareness that they even exist in the first place.Appealing to a more mainstream audience is also about the product itself. Log on to Spotify (or, again, most of its rivals) and you&apos;ll see more than the &quot;search box&quot; that they&apos;ve been accused of being in the past. Carefully-curated playlists based on genres, themes or moods, and recommendations of artists or songs you may like based on your listening habits, are to the fore.Spotify has made big strides in becoming a more accessible way to find music for people who don&apos;t want to spend that much time actuallyfindingmusic. Those efforts – fuelled by competition from Beats Music, Deezer, Apple and others – will continue.4. Taking on bigger beasts: Apple and YouTubeSpotify is bigger than Deezer, bigger than Rdio, bigger than Beats Music and the rest of its direct rivals. But it has bigger 900lb gorillas to battle in the coming months and years.Spotify isn&apos;t the biggest on-demand streaming music service in the world: YouTube is, particularly among younger internet users. And YouTube is expected to launch its own streaming music subscription service this year.Then there&apos;s Apple. For now, the iTunes Store is mainly about buying downloads rather than playing streams. Mainly? Some albums are available to stream on iTunes before their official release, as an incentive to pre-order the download versions.There&apos;s also iTunes Radio, which is only available in the US and Australia so far, but is expected to launch elsewhere in the next few months. It&apos;s more about personalised &quot;stations&quot; of music based on your tastes, favourite genres or specific artists than Spotify&apos;s fully on-demand – play anything you like – service. But if Apple does buy Beats Music, the two will finally be head-to-head.Apple and YouTube (well, Google) are massive companies with deep pockets: formidable foes for a company like Spotify. Apple in particular already has proven clout in negotiating exclusives with big artists – Coldplay, the Black Keys and Beyoncé&apos;s latest albums aren&apos;t on Spotify but they all got big promotion on iTunes.If the streaming music world turns into a flurry of chequebook exclusive deals, Spotify could be at a disadvantage to these bigger beasts. Who, don&apos;t forget, own the two big platforms – iOS and Android – that have been such an important part of Spotify&apos;s growth so far.5. Moving beyond music if necessaryEvery so often, Spotify is rumoured to be preparing to make a move into Netflix-style streaming video: TV shows and films. It hasn&apos;t happened yet, and it&apos;s fair to say the company has plenty on its plate expanding its music service around the world without trying to get into a different entertainment industry that has its own dominant players.Even so... there&apos;s an argument that the future of digital entertainment may move more towards people getting their content from fewer companies. Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Sony being the five that immediately spring to mind: all able to offer music, TV, films, e-books and games to customers from one place.Where does that leave Spotify – and for that matter Netflix too? This is a longer-term challenge, but Spotify&apos;s management team will already be thinking hard about what life might be like for a pureplay streaming music service in 5-10 years time.This doesn&apos;t necessarily mean Spotify should pile into video (and books, and gaming) as quickly as possible. It&apos;s about at least preparing the arguments for why people should still subscribe to a specialist music service in a potential world of digital jack-of-all-trades.•Spotify says it&apos;s &apos;a matter of time&apos; before it overtakes Apple&apos;s iTunes

Streaming music service Spotify now has 10m paying subscribers and 40m monthly active users, the company announced today.It&apos;s the first time Spotify has updated its public stats since March 2013, when the company had 24m active users and 6m paying subscribers.“We&apos;ve had an amazing year, growing from 20 markets to 56 as people from around the world embrace streaming music,” said chief executive Daniel Ek in a statement.“10 million subscribers is an important milestone for both Spotify and the entire music industry. We’re widening our lead in the digital music space and will continue to focus on getting everyone in the world to listen to more music.&quot;Spotify also announced that its users have created 1.5bn music playlists; that Avicii&apos;s Wake Me Up is its most-streamed song with 235m plays; and that David Guetta is its most-followed artist, with 5m fans subscribed to his updates on the service.Spotify’s rivals in the streaming music market include Deezer, which has12m active users and 5m paying subscribers, and Rhapsody, which has1.7m paying subscribersaround the world, split between its Rhapsody and Napster brands.Other direct rivals include Rdio, Google Play All Access, Microsoft&apos;s Xbox Music, Sony&apos;s Music Unlimited and Rara, although none of these companies have released their active-user and subscriber figures recently.In the US, there is also Beats Music, which launched in January and according to recent reports is beingacquired by Apple for $3.2bn, in a deal thought to also include its parent company Beats Electronics. Apple&apos;s streaming music ambitions represent one of the biggest challenges to Spotify.Its iTunes Radio service – which streams personalised &quot;stations&quot; rather than offering fully on-demand music like Spotify – is already available in the US and Australia with more countries expected to follow later this year, including the UK.Meanwhile, YouTube is also expected to launch a subscription music service in the near future, although it&apos;s already the biggest online source of free streaming music.•Spotify, Pandora and the profits problem for streaming music•Spotify tells fans why it doesn&apos;t have Coldplay&apos;s Ghost Stories•What&apos;s next for Spotify? Perhaps going &apos;beyond the Play button&apos;Buying Beats Music would pitch Apple into direct competition with Spotify, although the latter has already taken a few public potshots at iTunes. &quot;It is so obvious that Spotify is much better,&quot;Ek told The Hollywood Reporterin January.&quot;Some of our partners are saying Spotify is now generating more revenue each month across Continental Europe than iTunes,&quot;added Spotify&apos;s head of label relations Kevin Brownin April.However, that same month Apple said it has 800m registered iTunes accounts – &quot;most of these with credit cards&quot;CEO Tim Cook told analysts– which could be the target for an aggressive marketing push for Beats Music if the rumoured acquisition goes through.Spotify has grown fast: it launched in 2008 but didn’t reach 1m paying subscribers untilMarch 2011. It passed the 2m milestonein September that year,3m in January 2012,4m that July,5m that Decemberand then6m in March 2013. Spotify has thus doubled its paying subscribers since December 2013, adding around 290,000 new subscribers a month over that period.Spotify says it has paid more than $1bn in royalties to music rightsholders since its launch in 2008, with half of those payouts coming in 2013 alone. Streaming music is an expensive business though: in 2012,Spotify&apos;s revenues increased by 128% to €434.7m(£377.9m), but its losses increased from €45.4m in 2011 to €58.7m in 2012.Spotify has raised $537.8m of funding so far, including a $250m round in November 2013 valuing the company at $4bn. In March this year,Spotify was reported to be in talks with investment banksabout a possible stock market flotation in the autumn.Music industry body the IFPI said earlier this year that subscription streaming servicesgenerated more than $1bn of revenues for the industry in 2013, with more than 28m people paying for a streaming service that year – up from 20m in 2012 and 8m in 2010.British music fans spent £103m on streaming music subscriptionsand doubled their number of songs streamed to 7.4bn in 2013, according to industry body the BPI. In some countries, streaming has become the biggest source of industry revenues for recorded music: in Sweden, it accounted for 70% of sales in 2013, while in Norway it reached 65.3%.However, streaming remains a controversial topic for some musicians, who have criticised Spotify – and sometimes its label partners – for the size of its payouts and a lack of transparency over how they are passed on to artists and songwriters.Thom Yorke described the company as “the last desperate fart of a dying corpse”last year – the dying corpse being the music industry – whileDavid Byrne suggestedthat &quot;if artists have to rely almost exclusively on the income from these services, they&apos;ll be out of work within a year&quot;.Artists including Adele, Taylor Swift, Coldplay, the Black Keys and Beyoncé have withheld new albums from streaming services for months after their initial release as CDs and downloads, too.As Spotify grows, it hopes to persuade those artists and their managers that such &quot;windowing&quot; strategies will be counter-productive.The company launched a Spotify Artists websitein December 2013 to explain how it calculates its royalties, and outline its goal of reaching 40m paying subscribers in the future.•Spotify – five big challenges looming for the streaming service
The fallout from the recentEuropean court of justice rulingon the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; has reached far and wide in the past week, prompting an international discussion about how personal information is used online.Mario Costeja González succeeded in his bid to have two archived newspaper articles removed from Google&apos;s search index, securing an apparent victory for those who argue against the hegemony of tech giants. Those denouncing the ruling – spanning the tech industry, free speech advocates, mass media and evenDowning Street - have warnedthat this is bad for the internet, and bad for Europe.But there is another perspective. A growing number of academics have expressed a more profound and inspiring observation – a recognition that this ruling could eventually lead to the updating of an outmoded legal framework and help make the internet more harmonious than it is today.The internet is robust, but don’t touch itThe alarmist position generally proceeds as follows: The first and most compelling point is the assertion that the European court failed to balance rights to privacy and personal data against freedom of expression and information.Second, the ruling is considered hopelessly impractical for intermediaries: an “unprecedented burden”, as the lawyer and free-speech advocateMark Stephensexpressed it.Third, the argument is embellished with emotive claims about how this ruling will fragment, chill, choke, censor, or somehow damage the internet.Once these three factors are added to theselectionofcomplaintsthat Googlechose to revealin the immediate aftermath of the ruling – those from paedophiles, politicians, and physicians - the case appears to be an all-round disaster.We’ve seen arguments like this before. Freedom, impracticality, fragmentation – these are familiar tropes indebates over internet regulation and governance. If we don’t want to break anything, we should preserve the status quo of the great, unregulated, idiosyncratic,flawed-but-untouchableinternet.The counter-argument is that this position demonstrates a failure of imagination; the sacrificing of creativity to inertia. What if we didn’t just accept the compromises of the internet, but tried to improve or resolve them? Instead of harbouring despicable behaviour that we’d find unacceptable offline, what if the internet became moreforgiving and accommodating?Outdated law can now be bolsteredThere are as many points of view as there are academics, but if there was any consensus intheir responseit was that mainstream coverage of the ruling failed to critically interrogate the industry response, or to understand the complex legal precedent it presents.The court’s reasons do not explicitly deal with freedom of expression, leading manyacademicstoagreethat, in this particular case, the balancing exercise was skewed. “The essential problem with this judgment is that the CJEU concerns itself so much with enforcing the right to privacy, that it forgot that other rights are also applicable,” writes the University of Essex&apos;s profSteve Peers.Yetmostalsoagreethat the fault for this lies mainly with the regime created by the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive. With its roots in the preoccupations and technologies of the 1970s, this instrument is well described by Peers as “prehistoric in internet years”.Cambridge fellowDavid Erdosexplains that the directive has “always had lofty, and in many ways implausible, ambitions”. It rather missed the memo about life in the Google age, in its zealous fortification of external handling of personal data.The result, Erdos describes, is that the vision of the &quot;founders of European data protection... is in profound tension with the whole way in which information is disseminated and sought out online including not only by large corporations such as Google but also by hundreds of millions of individuals.”The court could have read Costeja’s case down. Instead, it called out the great sleeping lie of the routine non-application of data protection law. By doing so, it has provided an essential platform for public debate. The Commission’s currentreform proposalspresent an opportunity to rewrite the law to better accord with expectation and practice, so that there is no longer a need to feign compliance.Technology is a necessary agent in applying the rulingIn the meantime, however, Google must adapt to this immediate ruling. The alarmists, as well assomeacademics, call this impractical, invoking that lamentable bulwark of justice: pragmatism.But if anyone canproactively implementthe court’s ruling,Google can. What’s more, it’s right that werethinkthe roleof Googlein society, taking what East Anglia lecturerPaul Bernalterms &quot;a more objective view” that involves thinking “more about the kind of internet we want to have – and how to get it.” AsEvgeny Morozovpoints out, Google is a paragon for the data-hungry. The superficially appealing claim that it should be &quot;uncensored&quot; in satisfying the &quot;right to know&quot; has dangerous implications if we think of banks, insurance companies, and so on.Google of course has considerably more resources than dowdy data protection offices and, as the court recognised, a significant influence on the lives of many individuals.The court’s ruling was necessarily light in the detail of practical implementation. However, it is clear that technology-facilitated solutions are the only option if we intend to realise data protection at scale. Google is as good an agent as any in assisting with the task – underclose examination, of course, and ensuring that any solutions developed are transparent and interoperable across platforms.Fragile but important social norms can now be respectedPerhaps the most insidious aspect of the alarmist view is that it completely overlooks the precious and important social values at stake here: a society that respects autonomy andvalues forgiveness.As the Harvard professorJonathan Zittrain writes, there is a real problem with “the internet’s ability to preserve indefinitely all its information about you, no matter how unfortunate or misleading.” Though sometimes this may require removal of content, he suspects that “in many cases, the desire for such a right is merely the desire not to have your life presented to the world mechanistically and without review, with nothing more than a search term and a single click. This is a legitimate desire.”“Privacy allows us to experiment, make mistakes, and start afresh if we mess up”, writes the University of Chicago professorEric Posner. “Our children can’t stop their friends (or enemies) from posting drunken photos or a heedless rant, barnacles that will cling to them for years.” Privacy, he argues, “allows us to reinvent ourselves, or at least maintains the valuable illusion that reinvention is possible. It is this potential for rehabilitation, for second chances, that is under assault from Google.”The ability to let people move on is a deeply-held social value and one that we should exercise graciously. In this case, we’d do well to digest the court’s ruling, to cease the crossfire, and to think creatively about what happens next.Julia Powles is a researcher in law and technology at the University of Cambridge.

There is one question a lot of people ask while playing Candy Crush Saga: why am I playing Candy Crush Saga?This saccharine-splattered casual gaming treat, which hit 500m downloads last November, is both utterly compulsive and totally inexplicable to a huge number of its users.The same goes for other instant gratification hits like Flappy Bird and Farmville; the compulsion to play combined with the compulsion to tell people you hate playing. What is going on?To find out, we asked the cyberpsychologist Berni Good and Jamie Madigan, who runs the blogPsychology of Games, to explain the hidden processes going on beneath our mystifying addiction to casual games. Here&apos;s what they told us.Candy Crush SagaCandy Crush Saga… addictive.This hugely successful title belongs in a genre known as &quot;match three puzzlers&quot;, because it&apos;s all about getting three or more similarly coloured objects together within a constrained playspace. Zuma, Bejeweled and Jewel Quest work in exactly the same way.All of these games are based around an extremely effective compulsion loop – the sequence of events that underpin most game design systems: you perform an action, you are rewarded, another possibility opens – and so on. Behind the compulsion loop in Candy Crush are two important psychological motivations: pattern recognition and reinforcement.Our brains love to search for systems and sequences in the world around us; it is our primary method of reading our environment. So scanning the Candy Crush screen for possible colour matches is in itself pleasurable. This is how we read everything we see.On top of this, the game is based around very tight systems of reinforcement, the idea that behaviours can be encouraged if a pleasurable stimulus is provided. Indeed, critics of Candy Crush often allude to it as glorified Skinner box, referring to psychologist BF Skinner who experimented with variable reward systems on rats. In Candy Crush Saga, risk, reward and opportunity combine into a smooth and cohesive system, so that we&apos;re getting constant pleasure hits, and therefore constant cravings for more. Reinforcement is a key element of the compulsion loop – and in this case, the loop is so tight, it&apos;s difficult to escape.Another compulsive element of these games is something game designers call &quot;disproportionate feedback&quot; and its something borrowed from slot machines.Our brains have complex reward circuitry that can easily be triggered by an influx of pleasing feedback. In Candy Crush Saga, a successful move is accompanied by flashing colours, upbeat music and affirming words like &quot;delicious&quot;, which appeal directly to our reward receptors.At the same time, successful moves will often trigger a sequence of subsequent onscreen colour matches, which multiply the effect. The game congratulates us for our skill, even though such &quot;combos&quot; are often simply fortuitous – but our brain gets a pleasure rush anyway.Gambling machines work in a similar way through a system psychologists refer to as &quot;the illusion of control&quot;. Providing lots of nudge buttons and other input options – together with flashing lights and sound rewards for successful implementation – fools us into thinking we are skilled players rather than victims of a very clever system.Then of course, there&apos;s the simple innate desire to tidy up – to restore order. From Tetris to Candy Crush to Threes, there is an instinctive satisfaction in correcting something broken, wonky or incomplete. Game designer Hirokazu Yasuhara, who has worked on everything from Sonic the Hedgehog to Uncharted, put it like this inan interiew with Gamasutra:&quot;Let&apos;s say that you have a flat surface with some bumps sticking up out of it. Most people would want to see those bumps removed, as a sort of equalising or &apos;beautification&apos; process. Also, you know the game Othello, right? A lot of the fun in that game is the exhilaration you get when you flip a lot of pieces and make more of the board your color. Tidying up things, in a way.&quot;FarmvilleFarmville... compulsive Photograph: Stefan Sollfors/AlamyZynga&apos;s once hugely successful farming game may itself be fading in popularity, but it belongs to a thriving class of simulations in which players build and customise their own territories, often sharing the results with friends. Why do we enjoy building and personalising virtual environments? In evolutionary psychology, the theory of signalling suggests that a lot of our actions are actually methods of communicating our qualities.&quot;One of the things we tend to signal is conscientiousness,&quot; said game designer Raph Koster, when weinterviewed him about design secretsin 2011.&quot;For example, a really lovely, well-tended garden is a public signal of how responsible and dutiful you are, and how good you are at taking care of things, which could be a signal that you&apos;d be a good parent.&quot; So when we share a well-designed farm, city, or theme park with friends, we&apos;re telling them that we are good life partner material.There is a less charitable reading of our addiction to creative sims like Farmville and Sim City, however.&quot;Psychological research suggests that people will be very motivated to put lots of effort in if it means that they ‘look’ better than others,&quot; says Good.&quot;I think we see a lot of the ‘peacock effect’, also known as conspicuous consumption, going on in these games. First postulated by a Thorstein Veblen in 1899, the theory suggests that an individual will go to great lengths – and expense – to show others their possessions. It’s all about obtaining and exhibiting stuff to show off your wealth.&quot;This may be especially true in free-to-play games that allow players to spend money on customisation options like new outfits or building blocks: the more you purchase and show off, the theory suggests, the richer feel in comparison to friends.Finally, Jamie Madigan sees another motivation at work in games that operate a timer system where, say, crops automatically fail unless the player regularly tends to them.&quot;We hate to lose things and we hate to lose options to do things once we thing we have them,&quot; he says. &quot;This is because of what psychologists call &apos;loss aversion&apos; and &apos;psychological reactance&apos;. People will spend resources like money or time just to keep things in play once they&apos;ve gotten moving instead of losing the option to come back to them.&quot;Clash of ClansClash of Clans… captivating.Human beings have a basic desire for autonomy – a sense of control over our lives. In a 2011 meta-analysis, psychologists Ronald Fischer, and Diana Boer found that autonomy is a better predictor of happiness than money.Battle simulation games like Clash of Clans give the player complete control over an army as it engages in combat with an opposing force, providing not just autonomy but purpose. At the same time, you also get to design and build your own home base, allowing personal creativity.&quot;Simulation games let the player choose what they are building or what their character does or wears,&quot; says Good. &quot;That’s very freeing for people, especially when you think about all the imposed choices we face, such as work projects, paying bills, doing homework, etc. People get a sense of well-being in a fantasy virtual world wheretheymake the choices about ‘how they live’ and get to be creative without constraints or permission from partner or parents. That is very compelling&quot;.Angry BirdsAngry Birds... silly.In terms of casual game design, Angry Birds is effectively the perfect storm of compulsive factors. It has everything and it has it all in exactly the right quantities.Writing in Psychology Today, Michael Chorost once listed the four main reasons for the game&apos;s success: the interface is completely intuitive so there&apos;s no barrier to inhibit compulsion; there is disproportionate feedback when the bird hits the pig building (glass shatters, logs fall, stone crumbles); it&apos;s funny and different everytime so there&apos;s suspense; it&apos;s based on authentic physics, so we feel we can apply real-world skills to the game, making skill feel more &apos;legitimate&apos;.Chorost centres on the delicious delay between firing the catapult and seeing the results – it is nectar to our primal pleasure centres.&quot;The dopamine action in your brain makes you want to know, urgently, what will happen when you fire the bird. And it&apos;s extremely easy to get yourself in a position of wanting, because the game is so simple. It gives you intermittent but extremely satisfying rewards. So you pull the slingshot again and again and again. And again andagainandagainand AGAIN.&quot;Meanwhile, Raph Koster believes that atavistic skills may be re-awakened in the central aiming mechanic.&quot;It&apos;s evolutionarily useful that the brain fastens on challenging problems that have to do with trajectories,&quot; he told us when we spoke to him about compulsive games three years ago. &quot;Physics calculations like this were extremely valuable if you made your living with a spear.&quot;Flappy BirdFlappy Bird... flowyAlthough apparently an incredibly simple design – flap your wings to avoid the incoming pipes – the key to Flappy Bird&apos;s success is in its implementation. Everything from the height of each flap, to the width of the pipes, is exactly right, exactly challengingenoughto make players believe they can do better next time.Meanwhile, all extraneous detail is stripped away. The game starts quickly, and it usually ends quickly: and when it ends you can start immediately.This isn&apos;t just a compulsion loop, it&apos;s a compulsion trap.&quot;There is definitely an element of &apos;flow&apos; going on,&quot; says Good. &quot;Postulated by Mihaly Csikzentmihaly, flow happens when the gamer has clear defined goals and focuses solely on the task in hand so that they become completely immersed and engaged in the task to the exclusion of all else around them. There is a great motivational factor happening in this state: the gamer develops a unique sense of purpose, they forget time.&quot;According to Csikzentmihaly, flowis a route to contentedness; it is an intrinsically rewarding state. However annoying it is, Flappy Bird was born to make us happy.•Flappy Bird is dead - but brilliant mechanics made it fly•Popcap: the 10 secrets of casual game design•The player: Are casual games the victim of sexism?
What do people want from a new smartphone? More than camera quality, processor speed or brand name, what they really want is long battery life, according to a new survey.When asked about the importance of features, 89% cited battery life as &quot;important&quot;, with only 11% citing it as &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;not important&quot;, according to an online panel of 1,000 Britons surveyed by research company GMI.Brand name was next, at 68% (with 26% rating brand as &quot;neutral&quot;), followed by processor speed, at 67% (with 25% neutral).The survey revealed that peoples&apos; concerns over battery life means that half of them turn off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or GPS location services when they&apos;re not needed. Turning down screen brightness - one of the most effective methods of preserving battery power - was used by 40%.Although all those surveyed had a smartphone, only 5% carried a spare battery, and 4% had a case with a spare battery built in. Half of users charged their phone once a day; 10% charged it more than once a day. A third charged it every two to three days.Such tactics meant that 60% didn&apos;t run out of power ever - or only had such problems at most once a fortnight. But they tended to be older users; among the 18-24 group, 29% said that they ran out of power at least once a day while needing to do something, and then had to recharge their phones.Features voted 'important', 'neutral' and 'not important' by British users in GMI's survey, April 2014.

The least-wanted features were touchless payment technology - which only 20% thought &quot;important&quot;, and 53% thought &quot;not important&quot; - and 4G capability, which only 36% thought important, against 31% who didn&apos;t.Other features that ranked well were having a large screen - 60% thought it important, against 9% who called it &quot;not important&quot; - and having an operating system that links easily with the buyer&apos;s other devices, which was important to 57%, while 15% didn&apos;t.Screen size was ranked 5th most important in the GMI survey; in IDC&apos;s survey it was equal 2nd in importance to Android buyers, equal 6th most important to iPhone buyers, and 4th most important to Windows Phone buyersGender differenceThere were some notable differences between genders: although both picked battery life as the most important element, women ranked brand name ahead of camera quality and processor speed.But men thought processor speed was more important than brand, which in turn they picked that ahead of camera quality.The GMI survey also suggested that battery life was a factor in previous purchases: 71% said that it had been an important consideration in their purchase of their existing phone. Perhaps surprisingly, it was least important to those aged 18-24 (cited by 63%) - yet most important to those in the next age group (25-34).But the experience of running out of power clearly left its mark. Only 10% said that they would not research the battery life of their next phone - against 64% who said they would.Ralph Risk, marketing director for GMI in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, commented: “The fact that a long-lasting battery is the leading criteria when buying a new phone may come as a surprise. Whilst consumers are still concerned about getting the basics right, innovative features and ground-breaking apps still help to differentiate the products in a very competitive market.”•Motorola Moto E: is this the best phone for under £100?
A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamMicrosoft's expansion of Surface lineup may be ill-timed &gt;&gt; WSJ.comShira Ovide:"That's definitely been an eye opener: some of the slowdowns we've seen in the tablet market," said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. "Microsoft, they have no choice. They have to drive whatever share gains they can in the tablet market."Microsoft had a tough first foray into homegrown computing devices with the introduction of the Surface in October 2012. Microsoft has recorded about $2.64 billion in Surface sales so far. Apple, by comparison, sold $7.6 billion in iPads in the past quarter alone. Nomura Securities estimated that Microsoft has accumulated roughly $2 billion in operating losses on the Surface.The struggle in part reflects Microsoft's misjudgment of the market, analysts and people familiar with the company's strategy said. When it first introduced the Surface with a 10.6-inch screen, tablets with 7- to 8-inch screens were taking off in popularity. Small tablets accounted for more than half of tablets sold in 2013, estimates IDC.Why tech's best minds are very worried about the internet of things &gt;&gt; WiredKlint Finley:The Internet of Things is coming. And the tech cognoscenti aren't sure that's a good thing.For years, the prospect of an online world that extends beyond computers, phones, and tablets and into wearables, thermostats, and other devices has generated plenty of excitement and activity. But now, some of the brightest tech minds are expressing some doubts about the potential impact on everything from security and privacy to human dignity and social inequality.That's the conclusion of a new survey from the Pew Research Center.Big potential benefits, big potential downsides - mostly around security.Update: Russians capture cigarette-smuggling drone &gt;&gt; Ars TechnicaRussian border guards near Kaliningrad "detained" a low-flying drone entering the country from Lithuania last week. According to a spokesperson for Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), it wasn't on a spy mission—it was smuggling cigarettes.The autonomous aircraft, which had a four-meter (13-foot) wingspan, flew close to the ground following GPS waypoints and released cigarette cartons from its cargo bay at designated drop zones. When captured, it was carrying 10 kilograms (about 22 pounds) of illicit cargo.Expensive HDMI cables make no difference - the absolute proof &gt;&gt; Expert ReviewsTom Morgan:Whether or not to buy an expensive HDMI cable is one of the most contentious subjects on the internet. On pro the side of buying them are home cinema magazines and audiophile websites, which sing the praises of more expensive cables, heralding how they can do remarkable things, such as boosting flesh tones.On the other side, you have the sceptics that say HDMI uses digital, so all cables are equal. In fact, James Randi has even extended his $1 million prize for anyone that can prove paranormal activity to include anyone that canprove that expensive HDMI cables make a difference.Engage or die &gt;&gt; getwired.comWes Miller:Whether it's software or hardware, I've spent a lot of time over the last year or so working to eliminate tools that fail to make me more productive or reduce day-to-day friction in my work or personal life. Basically looking around, pondering, "how often do I use this tool?", and discarding it if the answer isn't "often" or "all the time." Tangentially, if there's a tool that I even use at all because it's the best option, but rarely do so, I'll keep it around. PaperKarma is a good example of this, because there's honestly no other tool that does what it does.However, a lot of software and hardware that I might've found indispensable at one point is open for consideration, and I'm tired of being a technology pack-rat.Google's datacenters on punch cards &gt;&gt; XKCD What If?If all digital data were stored on punch cards, how big would Google's data warehouse be?And loads more fascinating things that you can learn about quite how big Google's data store is.

The person next door routinely woke up at three to go to the bathroom, walking past a window that offered a partial view into the Maks' house. Behind the Maks' residence was a dog that was given to barking loudly. A neighbor across the street came out every morning at four to smoke a cigarette. If any of them were to raise an alarm, the search would not remain secret. Mak would find out and, if he was indeed a spy, it would become harder to find evidence against him.Shortly before midnight, Gaylord and two other agents got into a Chevy minivan with the middle and back rows of seats removed. The vehicle was identical in appearance to the one that Mak drove; it would raise no suspicions even if neighbors happened to notice it.The trick that makes Google's self-driving cars work &gt;&gt; The AtlanticAlexis Madrigal:But there's a catch.Today, you could not take a Google car, set it down in Akron or Orlando or Oakland and expect it to perform as well as it does in Silicon Valley.Here's why: Google has created a virtual track out of Mountain View.The key to Google's success has been that these cars aren't forced to process an entire scene from scratch.

They are not even the rich, road-logic-filled maps of consumer-grade Google Maps.They're probably best thought of as ultra-precise digitizations of the physical world, all the way down to tiny details like the position and height of every single curb. A normal digital map would show a road intersection; these maps would have a precision measured in inches.But the "map" goes beyond what any of us know as a map. "Really, [our maps] are any geographic information that we can tell the car in advance to make its job easier," explained Andrew Chatham, the Google self-driving car team's mapping lead……So far, Google has mapped 2,000 miles of road. The US road network has something like 4 million miles of road.Madrigal suggests that it would be more accurate to say that Google is "crawling" the world than "mapping" it.You can followGuardian Technology's linkbucket on PinboardTo suggest a link, either add it below or tag it with @gdntech on the freeDeliciousservice.
It&apos;s time for our weekly roundup of the best new Android apps and games to have emerged on the Google Play store.As ever, prices are correct at the time of writing, but may have changed by the time you read this. (Free + IAP) means in-app purchases are used within the app.Want more apps? Browse previousBest Android Appsroundups on The Guardian. And if you&apos;re looking for iOS apps, browse the archives ofBest iPhone and iPad appsroundups instead.APPSBright Weather (Free + IAP)We Brits love talking about the weather, but also checking it on our devices – weather is one of the most popular app categories in terms of usage. Bright Weather is the latest app hoping to take advantage: a sleek, well-designed app providing forecasts, weather maps and pretty backgrounds on demand.Swarm (Free)Social location app Foursquare has split into two apps: the main Foursquare is more of a city-guide these days, while the check-ins and mayorships and find-your-friends aspects that made its name have been spun out into Swarm. It’s neat and quick to use, but as ever, its usefulness relies on having enough friends using it.BillGuard - Money &amp; Finance (Free)One for Americans, this: a financial planning app that helps you budget and track spending, browse what you’ve been buying, and get an alert if your credit card is being used by a nefarious third-party. It works with a range of bank accounts and credit cards in the US, aiming to catch the fraud that banks miss.PingTune Music Messenger (Free)Messaging apps are popular, and music is popular. Now: they’re together at last! Is the theory behind PingTune, which gets people to find music they like on YouTube and SoundCloud, then ping it to friends with text and emoticons. It’s a neatly-developed idea, although sceptics will wonder whether this will ultimately be a feature in bigger messaging apps, rather than a standalone one.The Awesome Collection (£2.99)This app for children is a collection of three apps in one from developer StoryToys: Haunted House, The Jungle Book and Grimm&apos;s Puss in Boots. They’re all virtual pop-up books, offering a mixture of stories, mini-games and digital stickers and colouring. Good animation and sound make them perfect for preschoolers.City of York Hologram Tour (Free + IAP)One of my favourite school trips when I was young was to York’s Jorvik Viking Centre. Now there’s a new way to explore the city’s history: an augmented reality app. At certain places around York, it can be used to watch holograms of characters from the past – Romans, Normans and Victorians alike – while snapping photos of them. Sounds gimmicky, but it’s a fun way in to York’s past times.netwars – The Butterfly Attack - Episode 1 (£1.99)netwars is another intriguing use of mobile technology for storytelling: in this case, a three-episode (this is the first) graphic novel blending animation, video and gameplay. The story being told is one of sci-fi cyberwar: digital terrorism, virtual battlefields and the like. And the app is just one way in to the story, with plans for e-books, a TV series and online video.FishBrain Fishing: Angling Map (Free + IAP)Meet the quantifished self! This app is for anglers wanting a handy smartphone way to log their catches; share their proud, fish-hugging photos; get an insight into where other people are fishing nearby, and keep tabs on a range of weather-related attributes when deciding where they should cast their lines. The in-app purchase is for a subscription to the FishBrain service.Titanfall Companion App (Free)This should possibly be in the games section below, but it’s not a standalone game: instead, it’s an app working alongside EA’s critically-acclaimed console game Titanfall. You can check your stats, get information on the game and its world, and – possibly most useful – use the app as a second-screen map while playing the game.Taxicode (Free)- We must be getting to the point soon where there are as many taxi-booking apps as there are taxis on the streets of the UK. Taxicode is the latest, promising to cover 95% of the UK population, letting you compare quotes from different cab companies, book rides and pay via credit card.Monument Valley for Android.GAMESMonument Valley (£2.49)Beautiful puzzler Monument Valley was critically acclaimed on iOS, and managed to sell 500,000 copies in its first month. Now it’s on Android too: a surreal shape-shifting game that sees you guiding a mysterious princess through a series of impossible-architecture levels by tapping and swiping. Short, but incredibly sweet.Half-Life 2 (£5.99)Don’t get too excited yet: for now, legendary first-person shooter Half-Life 2 is only available for one Android device: Nvidia’s Shield handheld. Its appearance on the Google Play store hints that it will (hopefully) expand its footprint in the not-so-distant future though. Graphics, gameplay and storyline working together in perfect harmony (still).Maleficent Free Fall (Free + IAP)Anything Bejeweled can do, Disney can do… Well, it can do it as well. This is a match-three puzzle game based on Disney’s Maleficent film, as you swap gems and trigger combos while working your way through the storyline. In-app purchases, as ever for this genre in recent times, are used for power-ups.JoyJoy (£1.17)There’s a lot of excitement around JoyJoy this week, and rightfully so: it’s a twin-stick shooter with well-crafted controls, varied visuals and a well-tuned progression curve. Shoot everything, then shoot some more things. As twitch-gaming on Android goes, it’s up there with the best.Portal (£5.99)Don’t get too excited yet (again) – this is also exclusive to the Nvidia Shield for now. Hopefully it’ll soon broaden out too, because Portal remains a stone-cold classic of gaming on any platform: a first-person puzzler with head-boggling physics.Tiny Dice Dungeon (Free + IAP)This is a pixelly RPG from developer Kongregate: more monsters and character development, but with digital dice playing a key role in settling the frequent combat. But the real treat comes with an online multiplayer mode to test your skills against other players.FlapThulhu (Free)Yes, it’s a Flappy Bird clone, but wait! It’s not a rubbish one. In fact, this comes from well-respected developer Noodlecake Studios, and is a new take on the compulsively-addictive game inspired by the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft. Including the ability to play as a beast and fight things. Good fun.Mother of Myth (Free + IAP)What did the Romans and Greeks ever do for us? Apart from slaying mythical beasts, packing monstrous god-given fighting skills, and delivering one of the most polished action games for Android this year, of course. A neat blend of swiping’n’slashing with strategic collection of “deity cards” to boost your powers.Summoner Wars (Free + IAP)There are lots of card-battling strategy games for Android, but Summoner Wars has the makings of one of the best. Already acclaimed on iOS, it sees you battling against a mixture of Android-controlled and human opponents, building a deck and mastering the strategy of playing your cards right. Additional races can be unlocked through in-app purchases.Glorious Maximus (£0.59)Finally, more Romans! Although not in York, as far as I can make out. This is a fighty cartoon action game with 30 levels to batter your way through, looting and upgrading your characters as you go. There’s good scope for different battling strategies with the various characters.BONUS WEB-APPSpell Up (Free)Spell Up isn’t a native app, it’s a “Chrome Experiment” developed by Google, which can be played on computers, smartphones and tablets. It’s a game based on learning English, spelling the words that you hear, building towers of letters as you go. Innovative, but also rather fun.Those are our picks, but what have you been enjoying on Android this week? Post your recommendations (or feedback on these) in the comments section.
Facebook is rolling out its &quot;I&apos;m a voter&quot; feature worldwide, after the app&apos;s success in the Indian elections in early May.More than four million Indian voters clicked the button, registering that they had voted during the country&apos;s parliamentary elections,according to Reuters. Thanks to that success, the company is rolling the feature out for a number of upcoming elections.Facebook users in the EU, Colombia, South Korea, Indonesia, New Zealand and Brazil will all have the option to broadcast their status as voters. Scottish voters will have the chance to click the button twice, in both the European parliament elections and the referendum for Scottish independence.The feature was first introduced for the 2010 US mid-term elections, and by 2012, more than nine million voters had clicked it to report that they had taken part in the US presidential election.Now that the feature is active worldwide, Facebook estimates that a third of its active users will see the message in their news feeds at some point this year – more than 400 million people.And it&apos;s about more than just over-sharing. In 2010, the feature was credited with encouraging 340,000 people to vote who would otherwise have stayed at home.According to a studypublished in Natureby UCSD professor James Fowler, the &quot;social, non-partisan ‘get out the vote’ message&quot; had such a strong effect that 60,000 people who directly saw it will have been encouraged to vote. A further 280,000 users who saw the message when it was shared by their friends were also motivated to vote. &quot;The social network yielded an additional four voters for every one voter that was directly mobilized,&quot; Fowler said.•Facebook will take away users&apos; right to vote on policy – unless they vote for it
In social media terms,Facebookis already the guy at the bar who is reading your phone over your shoulder, making a note of your drink order, and grabbing a selfie with you without your permission (basicallyphotobombingyour entire life). And it just got creepier.Facebook is now asking you about your relationship, and more importantly,allowing others to ask you about your relationship. Facebook is sidling up to you at a bus stop, when you&apos;re minding your own business, and starting a conversation with a laboured, &quot;So…&quot; Facebook is inquiring whether you come here often, except it already knows you do, because all of your activity has a time stamp.For its next trick, the social media behemoth is testing out a new function to allow users to &quot;ask&quot; others about their relationship status,Gizmodo reports, as long as their status is set to private or undisclosed. You might think omitting this information is a clear sign that you&apos;d rather not share it with the world; but Facebook sees it as the green light to allow people to ask, so, like, what&apos;s going on with that?For a while now,Mark Zuckerberghas prompted users to fill in certain information on their profile page, which may have been left blank. He wants to know your hometown, and where you went to university.Photograph: Facebook/Business InsiderOpenly encouraging users to pester other people, however, is a new development. It&apos;s clear that Facebook is looking to cash in on the success ofTinderandDown (formerly known as Bang With Friends), the Facebook add-on which encouraged casual campus hook-ups.Online dating is big business. Sex sells. Facebook has always been apart of sniffing out potential beaus, but has never explicitly before tried to get in on the action, like a winking waiter lingering a little too long on a first date. Of course, the data collected on the reasons behind individuals&apos; relationship status will also bevery useful to Facebook and its advertisers.Photograph: Facebook/SlateEssentially, this isBridget Jones&apos; worst nightmare. Pre-internet, the worst thing about being single was enduring distant relatives pointing out your singleness. Or a Saturday night spent listening to thetumbleweed roll through your empty womb. Or your mum asking why ahandsome young man like you didn&apos;t have a girlfriend. And then asking whether you were gay.The worst thing about being married was watching with envy as your single,childless friendsgot to disco-hop across sticky nightclub floors. The worst thing about being in a civil partnership waslonging to be in a same-sex marriage. The worst thing aboutbeing in an open relationshipwas, well, everything about being in an open relationship.Now, the worst thing aboutall of these thingsis that people have the option, should they want to, to ask you about it.What do you make of Facebook&apos;s new Ask feature? Let us know in the thread below.
You can&apos;t stream Coldplay&apos;s new album Ghost Stories on Spotify yet: it&apos;s been withheld by the band, although its three singles (Magic, Midnight and A Sky Full of Stars) are available to stream.It&apos;s not a big surprise: Coldplay premiered the album as a pre-release stream on Apple&apos;s iTunes store, and famouslywithheld their last album Mylo Xyloto from streaming servicesfor four months after it went on sale.Whatismore of a surprise, though, is the message fans see when browsingColdplay&apos;s artist profile on Spotify. Ghost Stories is listed there, with all bar the three available tracks greyed out.But there&apos;s also a message: &quot;The artist or their representatives have decided not to release this album on Spotify. We are working on it and hope they will change their mind soon.&quot;This is the first time the company has experimented with this kind of messaging within its service for albums that have been held back. The same message appearson the Black Keys&apos; profilefor their new album &apos;Turn Blue&apos;, and onBeyoncé&apos;s profilefor her eponymous last album, which has yet to be made available to stream.The Coldplay message wasspotted and tweeted by Kieron Donoghue, who runs the playlist-sharing service Playlists.net.The message that fans see on Coldplay's Spotify profile.However, forAtoms for Peace–prominent critics of Spotifyin recent times – there&apos;s no message, or indeed any listing for the band&apos;s albums, so the message isn&apos;t yet standard practice for any album withheld from Spotify.Motivation? On the one hand, it&apos;s a sensible move: explaining to Spotify users why they can&apos;t listen to a particular album rather than just pretending it doesn&apos;t exist. As Spotify goes after an ever-more mainstream audience, this kind of explanation will be necessary.However, it is also hard not to interpret the messages as a slight raising of the stakes in the ongoing debate about albums being withheld from streaming services: making sure fans know who&apos;s responsible for an album not being accessible on their service of choice, and perhaps tacitly encouraging them to protest about it.A number of artists and songwriters have spoken out against Spotify and streaming in general over the last year, criticising the size of the royalties they get (via their label or publisher) from streams of their work.However, holding back albums – or &quot;windowing&quot; as it&apos;s sometimes known – is sometimes more about trying to maximise sales through download stores like iTunes before opening out to streaming, rather than a permanent boycott on principle. Taylor Swift and Adele are two other prominent musicians whose last albums were windowed in this way.&quot;Coldplay has decided not to make Ghost Stories available on Spotify and other streaming services,&quot; a Spotify spokesperson told The Guardian. &quot;There are tens of millions of the the best music fans in the world using Spotify and we&apos;re obviously disappointed at the band&apos;s decision to withhold this album from them.&quot;Magic has been streamed 54.4m times on Spotify so far according to figures on Coldplay&apos;s profile page. A Sky Full Of Stars has been streamed 6.3m times.•Spotify v Musicians: 10 things to read to understand the debate
Samsung has filed a trademark application for “Gear Blink” in Korea, an addition to the “Gear” line of smart wearable devices that is expected to be a Google Glass competitor.The Korean giant is working on a set of smartglasses, and has published various patents for wearable augmented reality glasses including one for avirtual keyboardprojected onto the wearer’s hands which allows typing in thin air.Samsung's patent for a virtual keyboard projected onto a user's fingers. Photograph: SamsungA patent application published earlier this year showed a headset that combined anearphone with a heads-up displaymounted in front of the wearer’s eye, much like Google Glass without the glasses frame, while a patent from March showed amore traditional glasses-frame mounted design.Samsung has leveraged eye-watching technology in its Galaxy S line of smartphones before, building features that allow users to scroll through text by looking up or down and that keeps the screen unlocked while the user is looking at the screen.The new trademark for “Samsung Gear Blink” could indicate that Samsung is preparing to bring its take on smartglasses to market, directly taking on Google’s Glass whichrecently went on general sale in the US. Reports from Korea indicate thatcould be as early as September this year.Samsung filed the trademark under 4020140033123 with theKorean Intellectual Property Rights Information Service.•Ray-Ban and Oakley maker Luxottica partners with Google to create Google Glass eyewear
China&apos;s government says it will avoid buying PCs running Windows 8, in a setback for Microsoft&apos;s efforts to promote the operating system.The government is the largest buyer of computer software in China, which in turn is thelargest PC market in the world, and now larger than the US. A decision there to avoid Windows 8 could have a long-term effect.The announcement, posted on a government news site on Tuesday, said desktop, laptop and tablet personal computers bought for government use must use a &quot;different&quot; operating system, without specifying which one. The Central Government Procurement Centre said the ban was part of a notice on the use of energy-saving products, Reuters reported.Some PC suppliers are still able to supply machines running the older Windows 7 software, which might satisfy the government under the new rules.The announcement was posted last week, suggesting that the move is not a retaliation for the decision by the US tocharge five Chinese military officials with hacking into US companies and organisationsto steal data.China still has the largest user base of PCs running Microsoft&apos;s 13-year-old Windows XP, for whichsupport was withdrawn in April. As much as 50% of the PCs there are still running XP, according to the research firm Canalys.Microsoft wants customers to switch to Windows 8, though a substantial number have not because of the expense and inconvenience.•US charges Chinese military officials over hacking claims going back to 2006
The Department of Health has commissioned the world&apos;s biggest study into the effects of mobile phones&apos; radio waves on childrens&apos; brains, nine years after a government study said children should only use mobile phones when &quot;absolutely necessary&quot;.The Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones (Scamp) will examine about 2,500 schoolchildren at the ages of 11 and 12, collect data about how they use the phones and how much time they spend on them, and assess them two years later on mental functions such as memory and attention, which continue to develop into the teenage years.While no study has ever shown harmful effects from the low-power radio waves, known as &quot;non-ionizing radiation&quot;, generated by mobile phones, almost all have focused on adults.The last advice on childrens&apos; use of mobile phones came in the Stewart report in January 2005, in which Sir William Stewart suggested that as a precaution children under eight should not use mobile phones at all, and that older children should use it for texting rather than voice calls.Since then ownership of mobile phones has continued to rise: an estimated 70% of 11- to 12-year-olds in the UK now own a mobile phone, rising to 90% by age 14.The Scamp study will be led by Dr Mireille Toledano, of the faculty of medicine at Imperial College, who has written papers on investigations into claims of cancer links between low-power emissions from mobile phones and from power lines.The Scamp study was commissioned by the Department of Health through the Research Initiative on Health and Mobile Telecommunications, which is funded jointly by the government and mobile phone operators.Toledano said: &quot;This advice to parents is based on the precautionary principle, given in the absence of available evidence, and not because we have evidence of any harmful effects.&quot;As mobile phones are a new and widespread technology central to our lives, carrying out the Scamp study is important in order to provide the evidence base with which to inform policy and through which parents and their children can make informed life choices.&quot;By assessing the children in year seven and again in year nine we will be able to see how their cognitive abilities develop in relation to changing use of mobile phones and other wireless technologies.&quot;The study will by its nature include some examination of the effect of Wi-Fi capability, given that many children now use smartphones - which tend to have higherSAR (specific absorption rate) values, a measure of how much electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by the body during use, than older mobile phones.But even that picture is complicated because older phones tend only to use GSM technology, which emits more radiation than the 3G technology of newer phones.Current UK health guidelines, based on the 2005 Stewart report, say children under 16 should be encouraged only to use mobile phones for essential calls, and where possible to use a hands-free kit or to send text messages. When they do have to make calls, they are advised to keep them short.Despite there being no convincing evidence that mobile phones affect adult health, experts have hypothesized that children could be more vulnerable to any effects due to their developing nervous systems and thinner skulls, which absorb higher levels of radio energy.Professor Patrick Haggard, deputy director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London and chairman of the Scamp steering committee, said it was important to have a well-funded, large-scale study. &quot;It has taken a long time to get to this. A longitudinal study, which looks at a lot people, is better but more expensive and hard to set up.&quot;A lot of earlier studies were too small to rule out chance effects, he said. &quot;It&apos;s good that the UK is leading in this. I hope that the public, parents and kids are prepared to give generously of their time.&quot;The World Health Organisation (WHO) has ranked forward-looking studies of the effects of mobile phones on children and adolescents as a &quot;highest priority research need&quot;, but to date there are only two studies, both in Europe, focusing on childhood cancers and mobile phone use. One has reported no association and the other is ongoing.Co-investigator Professor Paul Elliott, director of the MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health at Imperial College, said: &quot;Scientific evidence available to date is reassuring and shows no association between exposure to radio frequency waves from mobile phone use and brain cancer in adults in the short term (less than 10 years of use). But the evidence available regarding long term heavy use and children&apos;s use is limited and less clear.&quot;Another study, called Cosmos, which has a UK arm funded by the Department of Health, is currently investigating the possible long-term health effects of mobile phones on 290,000 adult users over a period of 20 to 30 years. The most recent study on this subject wasconducted in Australiafrom 2006-7 with 250 participants, and published in 2010. It found no statistical effect.Toledano said: &quot;Scamp will complement this other research by focusing on the ongoing development of cognitive functions in the brain during adolescence.&quot;Cognition is essentially how we think; how we make decisions; and how we process and recall information. It is linked to intelligence and educational achievement and forms the building blocks of the innovative and creative potential of every individual and therefore society as a whole.&quot;Children volunteering for the study will undertake classroom-based computerised tasks designed to measure cognitive abilities that underpin functions such as memory and attention. Together with their parents, they will also answer questions about their use of mobile phones and other devices, wellbeing and lifestyle.Toledano added: &quot;Taking part in Scamp is a fantastic opportunity for schools to bring &apos;live&apos; science into their classrooms, show children how we conduct health research and, above all, for schools, pupils and parents to make a real contribution to the health of current and future generations.&quot;
Motorola is hoping its £90 Moto E smartphone can kill non-smartphones and disrupt the budget phone market just like its Moto G has for the past six months. Motorola claims its selling point is a handset that is cheap but built to last - so is it really a bargain at just £90?SinceGoogle’s purchase of the company, Motorola focused its efforts on creating phones to fill the needs of specific groups of users. Its first phone,the Moto X, was critically acclaimed – a flagship phone that wasn’t too big and was packed with innovative features like touchless control. It didn’t sell very well, however.TheMoto Gwas Motorola’s next phone. It was low-cost, solidly built and with a classy software experience that was great value for £135, a budget smartphone that easily competed with phones twice its price. It sold well, becoming Motorola’s best ever seller, andpropelled the company from zero to 6% marketsharein the UK within six months.The Moto E, then, is Motorola’s lowest-end and likely to be the last Google-owned phone (beforethe Lenovo purchasecompletes), something it isopenly calling a “feature-phone killer”. It sits underneath the Moto G and aims to be the first smartphone for a group of consumers that have not been able to afford to buy a smartphone before.A body that doesn’t feel cheapMotorola Moto E review - a solid build. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Moto E is clearly a modern Motorola smartphone. It is the spitting image of the Moto G, only slightly smaller, and is obviously related to the Moto X.It feels robust, with very little flex in the body apart from when pressing very hard on the screen, which bends slightly. That solid build makes the phone relatively heavy at 142g, and noticeably heavier than the Nokia Lumia 520 or some other super-budget smartphones.The Moto E is also relatively thick at 12.3mm deep, but its curved back fits nicely in the palm of the hand. The back is made of a matt black plastic, which is smooth enough to help slide the phone out of bags or pockets, yet grippy enough that it doesn’t fly out of the hand when in use.A range of coloured backs will become available for those who want to personalise their phone.Motorola Moto E is splash resistant. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianCompared with larger smartphones, the curvaceous Moto E is easy to hold and use one-handed. Its 4.3in screen is bigger than the iPhone’s current 4in screen, but the majority of Android phones have screens in excess of 4.5in.The screen is also very good for a budget smartphone under £90. It is relatively low resolution with a screen density of 256 pixels per inch (ppi), far below the 329ppi screen of the Moto G, but comparable or higher than most of the other phones in its class.Despite being low resolution, the screen is very good. It is bright, with decent viewing angles and good colour saturation – a cut above most of its competition, including the Nokia Lumia 520. In general use the screen is crisp enough for viewing most text. It is only when you start to look at smaller text on desktop web pages that it becomes hard to read compared to higher resolution phones like the Moto G.Gorilla Glass covers the Moto E’s screen, making it scratch resistant, while a P2i nano waterproof coating on both the inside and outside of the phone makes it water repellent and splash proof.Overall, the Moto E feels more premium and expensive than it is, with build quality and features you might not expect on a £90 smartphone.SpecificationsScreen: 4.3in 540 x 960 qHD displayProcessor: 1.2 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200RAM: 1GB of RAMStorage: 4GBOperating system: Android 4.4 “KitKat”Camera: 5-megapixel rearConnectivity: Wi-Fi (n), Bluetooth 4.0 and GPSDimensions: 64.8 x 124.8 x 12.3mmWeight: 142gPowerful enough and lasts all dayMotorola Moto E review - SIM and micro SD slots hidden under the removal cover. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Moto E is a low-cost phone and doesn&apos;t have as much power as more expensive smartphones. Yet it doesn&apos;t feel slow or sluggish.A Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 1.2GHz dual-core processor makes the Moto E relatively fast and responsive, while 1GB of RAM – typically twice what is available in other smartphone costing less than £100 – allows every app to run without running into memory issues.The latest version of Google’s Android 4.4 “KitKat” software is designed to run on smartphone with 512MB of RAM, but some apps demand more than that - and so having 1GB of RAM makes a big difference in multitasking and apps performance.Of course it isn’t going to perform like a current flagship smartphone costing £500-plus, like the HTC One M8 or Samsung Galaxy S5, but the Moto E ticks along perfectly acceptably with minimal lag and even when browsing large websites like thedesktop Guardian front page.Apps also run well, including games, if you can get them installed in the first place, because the biggest corner that has been cut to make the Moto E cost so little is internal storage space.Motorola Moto E review - ergonomic curved back Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Moto E only has 4GB of built-in storage. The user only has access to just over 2GB of that, which means that storage is certainly tight. It has a microSD card slot that can accept cards up to 32GB – easily enough space for music, movies and photos – but for the most part apps need to be installed on the internal 2GB of storage.While most applications are relatively small, and careful management of which apps need to be installed will mean that the majority of users will not have much in the way of storage issues there are some apps that need much more space than 2GB.Some games, for instance, download a small program which then downloads a much larger file full of assets for the game. That can often be 1GB on its own, some even larger. While the games will normally run fine once installed, actually installing some games can be a real issue.Motorola has added a utility to Android that allows apps to be moved to an SD card, but not all apps can be moved and it is a time-consuming, manual process requiring the user to move apps individually.Motorola promises all-day battery life and in my testing the Moto E lives up to that that promise. The smartphone will last a good day’s worth of fairly heavy use with email constantly arriving via push messaging, about two hours of web browsing, one hour of listening to music via Bluetooth headphones and around 30 minutes of gaming.The standby time was much longer, lasting a good three days while dropping only around 30% battery.For the average first-time smartphone buyer the Moto E should easily last two days&apos; average use, if not much more, if left on standby for large periods of the day.Motorola Moto E review - headphones port in the top Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSmall, useful tweaks to optimised AndroidOne of the reasons the Moto E is relatively fast and fluid at loading apps and within the Android software is that Motorola hasn’t added much to the standard Android experience.As with the Moto G, most of the company’s software development efforts have been spent on optimisation, speeding aspects of the phone up and reducing the Moto E’s overall power consumption, which has paid dividends in the responsive feel of the phone and extended battery life.The Moto E has full access to the Google Play store with its 1m standard Android apps and runs the latest Android 4.4 “Kitkat” version of the Android software. Motorola will guarantee an update to the next version of Android, which is due to be announced at the Google I/O developer conference at the end of June.Motorola has added a few bespoke apps, including Motorola Migrate, which helps you transition to the Moto E from other Android smartphones, pulling contacts, call history and text messages, photos and videos wirelessly to your new phone.Motorola Assist is another useful app that plugs into your calendar, automatically silencing your phone when in meetings or at night, with favourites lists that allow phone calls through if the caller calls twice in quick succession.Finally, Motorola Alert is worth mentioning as it acts as a panic button, automatically calling emergency contacts or the emergency services, as well as sounding an alarm. The app can send your location to a friend or family member, and send short bursts of pre-defined text like “I’m in danger! I need your help.”.Poor cameraMotorola Moto E review - the 5-megapixel camera on the back isn't up to much. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianAlong with low storage space, the other corner Motorola cut when getting the price of the Moto E under £90.It’s a 5-megapixel camera, but it lacks auto-focus, which means that objects in the foreground can appear out of focus if too close. The photos it captures are weak, often lacking colour and detail – not a replacement for a point-and-shoot camera like most more expensive smartphones.It also lacks a flash, while video capture is limited to standard definition. There is also no front-facing camera, which means selfies and video calling are out, but that is probably not a problem for the target market.Priced to sellThe Motorola Moto E costs £90 available from 22 May in the UK, but it costs just Rs 6,999 (£70) in India exclusively from Flipkart. It is expected to cost less, in the region of £80, locked to particular mobile phone networks on pay-as-you-go plans.Verdict: a super-budget smartphone done rightMotorola Moto E review - a decent, budget smartphone for under £90. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianMotorola has done an very good job of balancing price and quality with the Moto E. As a first-time buyer’s smartphone or for emerging markets like India it is both affordable and a great experience, easily being the best smartphone available for less than £90 list price.The Moto E does have some shortcomings, most notably the poor camera and shortage of internal storage, which a microSD can’t quite fully make up for. But it is solidly build, with a decent for the price screen, all-day battery life and Android that feels fast and fluid, not laggy and bogged down by bloatware.While the Moto G is still a better phone - and one I would recommend spending the extra £20-40 on - the Moto E is leagues apart from most of its poor sub £100 competition.For those trying to replace a feature phone with their first smartphone, or for whom most smartphones seem too expensive, the Moto E is a solid smartphone that gets the basics right. And that’s all you can really ask for £90.Pros:Solid build, microSD card slot, good screen for the price, all-day battery life, cheapCons:poor quality camera with no auto-focus, very limited internal storage, 3G-onlyOther reviews•Motorola Moto G: a great budget smartphone for £135•Google Nexus 5: a flagship Android smartphone for just £300
A breakthrough in wireless technology could allow a new wave of health tracking tools that can be embedded inside our bodies – in our livers, hearts and even in our brains.A new wireless charging technique known as “mid-field wireless transfer” can deliver power to tiny electronic devices such as sensors, pacemakers and nerve stimulators embedded deep within the body. They can be charged using a device the size of a credit card placed outside the body.&quot;With this method, we can safely transmit power to tiny implants in organs like the heart or brain, well beyond the range of current near-field systems,” said Dr John Ho, co-author of the study thatappears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.‘Make these devices as small as possible’Sensors can be embedded deeper into the right areas of the body, without needing to be close to the skin for current near-field wireless charging technologies like those that charge electric toothbrushes. The embedded devices will also no longer need large, bulky batteries, which means it is possible for them to fit into tighter, more sensitive spaces.“We need to make these devices as small as possible to more easily implant them deep in the body and create new ways to treat illness and alleviate pain,&quot; explained Professor Ada Poon, lead researcher behind the new techniquein a press release.An example of a tiny wireless power module that could be implanted in the body.Current implantable devices such as pacemakers use large, long-life batteries which often need replacing, requiring more surgery, while others use near-field wireless charging and therefore need to be placed close to the skin.Poon’s team developed a new type of near-field wave that propagates through skin and body tissue, rather than be reflected like longer wavelengths or absorbed by like typical near-field chargers. The wireless charging emits waves at roughly the same power levels of a mobile phone, and is therefore deemed safe for use.The researchers demonstrated the power delivery technology in a pig and a rabbit, which had a tiny pacemaker fitted solely powered by the wireless technique.‘Paving the way for new innovation’The discovery opens up greater possibilities for medical implants called “electroceutical&quot; devices, which use electrical stimulation to treat illness or alleviate pain that would typically require longterm drug treatment. Diseases like Parkinson&apos;s are already treated with techniques like deep brain stimulation to control shaking symptoms.Beyond medical devices, one of the largest stumbling blocks to embedding computing devices and sensors in the body has been supplying them with power. With the ability to power them the possibility of embedding fitness trackers, biosensors such as heart rate, blood glucose and hormone monitors, or any other small electronic devices within the body has been opened up.“The Poon lab has solved a significant piece of the puzzle for safely powering implantable microdevices, paving the way for new innovation in this field,” said William Newsome, director of the Stanford Neurosciences Institute.Having proved that the technique works in animals, Poon and her team are currently preparing for human testing, which will require approval from safety regulators and will take several years before the technology will be certified for use in medical devices and beyond.•Headphone implants are the ultimate in discreet listening•Apersonal NFC chip in your handcould unlock your house with wave
Thought Facebook was creepy enough? Think again.The social media giant has reportedly rolled out a feature which lets you ask your friends if they&apos;re single, if they&apos;ve yet to fill out their relationship status on their profile. Once you click the button, you also have the option to send your friend a message telling them exactly why you&apos;re so curious about their relationship status.For now, the feature is only visible on US profiles. Facebook has encouraged users to &quot;ask&quot; their friends to fill out full contact details since January, but this is the first time the feature has been extended to relationships.Some,like Mashable, are saying it&apos;s another way to use Facebook to find dates. Others think it&apos;s just a step too far.Whatever you think about the new feature, plenty of us have creepy stories about Facebook to share. We&apos;d like to know what&apos;s the strangest thing that&apos;s ever happened to you on Facebook?

The Towpath Cafe, on the bank of the Regents Canal as it runs through Haggerston in east London, isn&apos;t the best place to hold an interview: on the first warm day of the year, distractions are rife.&quot;That dog is really … what&apos;s happening over there?&quot; asks Hannah Donovan, one half of This Is My Jam, mid-way through a description of how her site will change as it drops the beta label and launches fully this summer. Shortly afterwards, a flotilla of school-age kayakers pass, and drown out her co-founder Matthew Ogle.The bundle of changes that make up the new version 1.0, collectively called &quot;song clubs&quot;, come after two years of experimentation. There&apos;s a lot of changes afoot, but at their heart, the pair hope to end the debate over whether algorithms or humans are better at making the sort of accurate recommendations which are the lifeblood of companies as diverse as Spotify and Amazon.&quot;The pendulum has swung,&quot; explains Donovan. &quot;We&apos;re not stuck in this stupid argument anymore about &apos;robots v people&apos;. There&apos;s major companies out there that are starting to see the value in both.&quot;Donovan and Ogle, both naturalised brits who met in their native Canada, have experience on both sides of the war. They got their start at Last.fm, one of the first companies to apply the basic tenets of big data to music. Users &quot;scrobbled&quot; every track they played to the company&apos;s servers, which then crunched the numbers and used the information to suggest new things to listen to.&quot;Technically, big data was just a really sexy problem to solve,&quot; says Donovan. &quot;Like, all of a sudden we had the computing power, and the storage, and the speed and the ability to do all thisstuff, you know what I mean? And so between 2006 and 2012, if you were a technologist working in that area, it was one of those things that was becoming possible and it was awesome and exciting.&quot;At last.fm, &apos;editorial&apos; was a bad wordThe pair tired of that attitude. &quot;In many ways, especially at the start, This Is My Jam was a direct response to our time at Last.fm,&quot; says Ogle. &quot;At Last.fm, saying the word &apos;editorial&apos; in a meeting was like saying &apos;cunt&apos;,&quot; adds Donovan.But This Is My Jam isn&apos;t a total reversal. The site asks users to share the one song which is currently most central to their lives, lets them listen to all the songs their friends have selected in one long playlist. The result is inevitably an eclectic compilation of stand-out tracks; but one fundamentally put together by humans, not algorithms.For the first two years, that was enough. With a well-curated list of friends (both Donovan and Ogle emphasise the importance of avoiding adding people on Jam out of a sense of social obligation. &quot;I think we&apos;re actually going to change the wording on the &apos;follow&apos; button,&quot; says Han. &quot;If it was &apos;add to my playlist&apos; or something it would have a little less weight&quot;) Jam wins out against the best radio station for finding new music to listen to, or just running in the background.But now, the pair find themselves in possession of a treasure trove of data, and old habits die hard. Their database consists of a tiny fraction of that collected by services like Last.fm or The Echo Nest, the music data service where Jam began as a skunkworks product and which still owns a small stake in the company. But every single song in that database was for one fleeting moment someone&apos;s favourite song in the world.For Ogle, the power of that database became clear when he was working on That One Song, a feature hacked together in two days which recommends &quot;the one song&quot; to listen to for any band. At the last minute, they decided to add a &quot;B-side&quot; feature, looking for a more obscure selection from the same artist.&quot;The algorithm for what makes a b-side was very primitive… it just looked for jams that hadn&apos;t been posted nearly as much as the A-side but had strikingly high likes or plays. I thought that would be a good indicator for something which was loved but less common song.&quot;I reloaded the page for New Order, the B-Side became 1963, and then the first comment was… &apos;total unappreciated jam&apos;. I just stood there being like &apos;wow, OK, this is some powerful shit&apos;.&quot;Not big data, but notable dataThe rationale for big data is that, with enough information going in one end, and enough processing power crunching it, insights can be drawn from the flimsiest of foundations. So, for instance, Last.fm&apos;s algorithms don&apos;t care if you leave iTunes on shuffle while having a shower, because the randomness is cancelled out by the sheer weight of songs which you did choose to listen to.Jam&apos;s breakthrough is that you can apply the same processing techniques to data which is picked with care and attention, and the results are far more effective. They call the idea &quot;notable data&quot;.&quot;Notable data is two things,&quot; Donovan explains. &quot;One is the fact that the piece of data is more significant, it&apos;s maybe got some higher emotional quality.&quot; For Jam, that means that the service isn&apos;t simply asking users what they&apos;re listening to, but asking them what the most important song in their life is.&quot;The second is that it has more of these rings of metadata associated with it. Think of the jam as a planet: it&apos;s got plays, comments, likes, and they all tell you something more about it.&quot;Ogle jumps in. &quot;I would argue a third tenet, which is that it should be recorded explicitly, rather than implicitly. One of the big things about big data was that all the technological advances that Hannah spoke of really meant that suddenly you could track and store and notice things that before would never tracked or stored or noticed or acted upon.&quot;&quot;So, at Last.FM in particular, the mental breakthrough was &apos;wow, we don&apos;t need to rely on people clicking star ratings or a heart button, we can simply look at what they play.&apos; For data to be notable, there&apos;s something about consent or permission. The explicitness of someone saying, &apos;hey, this may not be my most listened song this week, but I&apos;ve decided to tell you that this song is important right now.&apos; The very fact that I&apos;ve decided to do that is interesting.&quot;Citizen DJsWith notable data, Jam is attempting to find a synthesis between the all-algorithm approach of big data, and the human-driven response of companies like Beats, which launched its streaming music platform to great fanfare with hand-curated playlists.&quot;With Jam,&quot; Han says, &quot;we have less data but it&apos;s also more notable. So we have an opportunity to highlight stuff that feels as curated as a Beats playlist might, but that&apos;s actually been brought to you in a slightly more programmatic way.&quot;It&apos;s a little bit like, I guess, the Guardian experimenting with citizen journalism. Anybody who works in the space knows that there&apos;s a ton of untapped potential. I found this amazing Turkish user on Spotify who&apos;s put together the definitive playlist of turkish psychedelic rock, Anatolian rock, ever.&quot;But will the concept spread beyond Jam? &quot;Music just happened to be one of the media types to get thrown at the internet shit fan the soonest,&quot; she says, &quot;and because of that it tends to be a good indicator of trends around media.&quot;As the Song Clubs update rolls out over the summer, Jam users will have the chance to put Donovan and Ogle&apos;s theories to the test.•Introducing This Is My Jam
Under the arches of London Bridge two policemen pursue a murder suspect. The man gasps for breath, desperately searching for an escape route as the cops close in. Meanwhile, some place not far away, a crowbar-wielding physicist lunges desperately at a reanimated corpse. An experiment has gone wrong, opening a portal to a savage alien world. Chaos ensues.Both of the above are performances of sorts; in the first, the suspect is an audience member in an immersive theatre production; in the latter, the physicist is a gamer. At first glance, theatre and games seem like opposing artforms – one steeped in hundreds of years of convention; the other technologically advanced and obessively forward-looking. But beneath the surface there are many similarities; they can play with us in ways that film and TV cannot. And increasingly they are moving closer together.Being the storyOver the past three decades, the experience of playing video games has had a profound effect on the way artists and audiences engage with stories. Adventures like Myst, Half-Life and Grand Theft Auto have introduced fresh narrative structures and plot devices, and theatre practitioners have picked up on the cues.Loosely embracing categories like &quot;promenade performance&quot; and &quot;site-specific play&quot;, immersive theatre refers to any production in which audience members are put into the scene, and maybe even given bodily involvement in the action. Sometimes the audience is ushered from one place to another, sometimes they’re allowed to explore the space of the play all on their own.Immersive theatre has grown in popularity since the beginning of the 21st century, its rise aligning with gaming&apos;s entry into the wider public consciousness. British companies such asPunchdrunk,Belt-upanddreamthinkspeakhave pushed the form, filling warehouses with large sets and channelling the audience through their scenes much like a game will channel the player through a level. It’s clear the two art-forms tell stories in very similar ways.Stories are divisionsWalls are a good place to start. In the expanse of an empty computer-generated environment, a game designer needs to erect walls; walls that inevitably form into corridors. Half-Life, that seminal science-fiction shooter, is a master-class in directing the player down these tight spaces. As you run from one part of the sprawling Black Mesa facility to another you choose how to fight, you decide when to hide, but you are inexorably funnelled down a path to a specified end.Half-Life – a world of corridors and constrained spaces. Oh and transmogrified scientist monsters.It’s a technique familiar to anyone who’s been to see a piece of immersive performance. Liberated from the plush balcony chair, you are thrust into a world where you can go where you please, but you need to go different ways to see what happens next, down an alley, into a room. Making a good immersive show is difficult and, like games, much of the trick teeters on the balance between scripted-events and audience-freedom, between getting people to go down the corridors and making them want to go down the corridors all of their own accord.In Rift’s 2013 adaptation of Kafka’s The Trial, the audience members were cast as protagonists and squeezed around a transformed Shoreditch Town Hall. Given some agency over where to go, the audience were presented with an impression of freedom but were ultimately, like Josef K in Kafka’s tale, led inexorably to an execution site. It was a structure directly inspired by games. “Train, the level in Goldeneye 64 where you walk down one long corridor is utter genius,” says Felix Mortimer, Rift&apos;s co-director. “It’s great at guiding the player along a linear track. In The Trial we had a track which led our audience – but they would often challenge it.”A scene from RIFT's interactive production of The Trial by Franz Kafka Photograph: RIFTThis sense of defiance is also at the heart of The Stanley Parable, a surreal adventure game which sees the player constantly trying to evade the narrator’s direction. If you disrupt one line of story, the narrator needs to adapt to make a new one and in this way the game raises interesting questions about what can be done to empower the player while maintaining a satisfying narrative structure. If the player continually attempts to derail from the linear tracks, how else can a story be told?“We try not to spoon-feed the audience,” says Felix Barrett, artistic director of Punchdrunk, whose showThe Drowned Man, a fable about sixties Hollywood, is currently occupying four floors of the Temple Studios building in central London. “There are two ways of watching The Drowned Man. Either you can follow one character and treat it as a completely linear show, or you can follow your instincts, treat it as free-form exploration and let the beats of architectural detail lead you.&quot;It’s similar to how in Skyrim you can follow a character and go on a mission, or you can explore the landscape, find moments of other stories and achieve a sense of an over-arching environment.”Skyrim – the sprawling RPG adventure can be as much about exploration as narrativeFor Barrett, exploration is crucial. Walls can make rooms as well as corridors, rooms with secrets to uncover. And uncovering here doesn’t necessarily mean unravelling or derailing the story, it can mean discovering separate, smaller tales. Skyrim lets you do this on a grand, loose scale, but for a more focused experience Barrett points to Gone Home; a game which puts you inside a large family home and lets you discover journals and tapes which illuminate the story.“Gone Home has an implicit narrative,” says Barrett. “You’ve either just missed the action or it’s just about to happen and you’re suspended in-between.” Like Gone Home, The Drowned Man gives the audience space to discover messages and trinkets hidden behind cupboards and here again it’s these personal findings, more-so than any prescribed set-pieces, which stick in the memory. “Rather than an audience crafting their own narrative they are peeling back layers of story, almost archeologically,” says Barrett.Fullbright Company's intriguing adventure game Gone Home feels like an immersive theatre production in its use of environmental story tellingBoth Gone Home and Drowned Man cast the participant as a hunter, an active assembler. You are not passively waiting for the next event to happen, you have to dig into the scenery and heave out the plot. This is a method that&apos;s very different from books and film, but shared by immersive theatre and games. In effect, understanding The Drowned Man is like solving puzzles in Grim Fandango or piecing together the history of Lordran in Dark Souls. It is interactive, not passive.From linear corridors to rooms full of secrets, the question surfaces of whether audiences or players can completely construct their own stories in these environments. The interactive theatre companyConeycertainly believes so. Its 2009 show, A Small Town Anywhere, casts the audience as citizens in a small town on the brink of social collapse. Given roles and nudged towards events, the audience had objectives to complete but the way these were achieved (or not) were down to the individuals.“We developed a ‘game engine’, a live game engine, which was based on the play adapting to the gossip around the town,” says Tassos Stevens, co-director of Coney. “But if it’s a game it’s a badly designed one, because it’s deliberately open-ended about where the audience can take the action.”There are echoes of game design in Coney’s method but, compared to the pre-programmed approaches of a game, the audience’s imagination and actor’s improvisation mean there are a multitude of ways to create a scene, as Tassos illustrates: “There was one performance where a teenage boy playing La Librarian decided that ‘her’ secret was that she was not a middle-aged woman but rather a man called Barry in hiding; he played this by sustaining a bad broken falsetto through the entire two hours of the show.”Freedom and dramaIt’s hard to imagine the same level of adaptability in a game story, but the possibilities of live performance can lead to limitations of another kind. While theatre has to make do with what’s physically at hand, in most cases a warehouse and dim lighting, games can expand beyond these boundaries into massive cityscapes, temples and mountains.With procedural generation, these landscapes can pop-up differently each time. In games like Minecraft or Don’t Starve there are no real objectives other than survival; the balance between scripted events and player freedom skews toward the latter. While Coney’s show had a level of open-endedness, there were still actors and directors shaping the audience’s decisions towards a definite conclusion. While the prospect of a Minecraft play, in which audience members chop down trees and build cabins in an east London warehouse, sounds like a hoot, translating these open-ended experiences into a live performance would result in a pretty unsatisfying theatrical experience.“How can you take theatre and put it into games?” asks Barrett. “What’s the Titus Andronicus of computer games? That’s the questions we want to be actively posing over the next 10 years.” The gaps in the brickwork mean that theatre and games can peer at each other, but the lines between the two are still there. Theatre shouldn’t necessarily try to be a video game, and games shouldn’t try to be theatre, but, as Barrett suggests, there are things to learn, techniques to borrow.Games are growing, breaching into other spaces to define their own territory. Theatre is doing the same, snatching at its neighbours, testing its barriers. They make spaces of their own but the overlap is quietly growing. Standing in a room, whether in a game or a performance, you still search for story. You have the same desire to explore.•Inside The Drowned Man with Punchdrunk&apos;s Felix Barrett – audio slideshow•Interactive theatre: five rules of play from an audience perspective•Wisdom of the crowd: interactive theatre is where it&apos;s at
The US Justice Department indicted five Chinese military officers with stealing data from six US companies and unions on Monday, inaugurating a major escalation of tensions with China over economic spycraft.Attorney general Eric Holder announced that the US for the first time would seek to bring officials of a foreign government to the US to face charges of infiltrating American computer networks to steal data beneficial to US trade competitors. The Justice Department even went as far as printing “wanted” posters.The charges come as revelations about the scale of National Security Agency surveillance from whistleblower Edward Snowden indicate that at least some US surveillance carries an economic benefit.“The range of trade secrets and other sensitive business information stolen in this case is significant and demands an aggressive response,” Holder said on Monday.While suspicions about government sponsorship of corporate data theft have swirled around China for years, never before has the US formally accused officials from China, or any other government, of involvement.Not only has attribution of online espionage long vexed investigators, the prospect of diplomatic or economic retaliation has also been an impediment to taking action. The Justice Department national security chief, John Carlin, and colleagues from the Federal Bureau of Investigation credited a years-long effort, and the willingness of companies to admit to a data breach, with “exposing the faces and the names behind the keyboards in Shanghai.”Accused are Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu, and Gu Chunhui, whom a federal grand jury in Pennsylvania indicted on 31 counts of espionage. Carlin described the five men as members of a People’s Liberation Army entity known as Unit 61398.Three of the five officials on an FBI 'Wanted' poster. Photograph: APLast year, a report by the information security firm Mandiant concluded that Unit 61398 was most likely behind data theft comprising hundreds of terabytes, a scale it found to be unlikely to have occurred without government sponsorship.Mandiant found that the unit’s network infiltrations “periodically revisit the victim’s network over several months or years and steal broad categories of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, and emails and contact lists from victim organizations’ leadership.”The alleged data theft affected aluminum giant Alcoa, US Steel, the US Steelworkers Union, electricity and nuclear energy firm Westinghouse, Allegheny Technologies Inc, and SolarWorld. A senior FBI official, Robert Anderson, said he hoped other companies who experienced theft of proprietary information would “come forward and talk to us”.China&apos;s foreign ministry called the allegations “extremely ridiculous&quot;. Ministry spokesman Qin Gang demanded that the US “immediately rectify its mistake&quot; and repeal the lawsuit, according to astatement on its website.“This grave violation of the basic norms of international relations has harmed Chinese-US cooperation and mutual trust,” he said, adding that China has already lodged a formal complaint with US authorities.The Chinese government frequently counters hacking allegations by claiming that the country is a safeguard of internet security and that cyber-attacks are a universal problem. Qin said that China “never engages in the activity of stealing commercial secrets through the internet.” He called the allegations “baseless”.“For a long time, American authorities have conducted large-scale, organized cyber-theft and cyber-espionage activities against foreign dignitaries, companies and individuals,” he said. “This is already common knowledge.”The US military has for years suspected its Chinese counterpart of stealing proprietary defense information, including about thedesign of the F-35 family of stealth jets, even as it seeks to forge closer ties with the People’s Liberation Army.General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, welcomed his PLA counterpart to the Pentagon last week, but both officersavoided talk about cyber espionagein a Thursday press conference.Some observers said China was all but certain to retaliate, economically or diplomatically. “Clearly, China will need to respond in some fashion,” said a trade lobbyist who requested anonymity. “Hopefully, advancements will be made that won&apos;t impact economic development for either country.”James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the effect would be &quot;intangible&quot; but the formal accusation &quot;sends a strong message&quot; to Beijing.But Holder said that he wanted China to turn the five officers over to the US to stand charges, an unlikely step for the Chinese to take. “Our intention is for the defendants to have due process in an American court of law,” Holder said.The US posture is complicated by recent revelations of widespread NSA surveillance that impacts the blurry area between economic and security matters. Since the Edward Snowden disclosures began, the US has drawn a distinction between spying for security purposes, which it considers legitimate, and surveillance intended to reap economic advantages, which it does not.But the NSA penetrated the servers of the Chinese telecom corporation Huawei, which US officials consider little more than a stalking horse for Chinese surveillance, and put the company’s executives under surveillance, the New York Times and Der Spiegelreportedin March.While the US insists its concerns about Huawei are predicated on security threats from Huawei products sending customer data back to China – and the opportunities of inserting backdoors into Huawei products used by surveillance targets – Huawei has felt those concerns amounted to a pretext. Last year it announced it wouldabandonthe US market, although executives laterwalked the announcement backsomewhat.Documents leaked by Edward Snowden showedthe NSA targeted the Brazilian oil firm Petrobras, even as the NSAinsistedthat its Defense Department parent “does not engage in economic espionage in any domain, including cyber,” in a statement to the Washington Post.Holder attempted to distinguish between economic and security surveillance in a Monday press conference. “All nations are engaged in intelligence gathering,” Holder said, but the current indictment involves “a state sponsored entity, state sponsored individuals, using intelligence tools to gain commercial advantages, and that is what makes this case different.”
