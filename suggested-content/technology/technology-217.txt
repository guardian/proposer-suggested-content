Microsoft is in talks to invest up to $3bn (£1.9bn) in the private equity buyout of personal computer maker Dell, according to a US report.As the world's third largest PC manufacturer, Dell is one of the biggest distributors of Windows software and its future is tightly bound with Microsoft's.The software giant is in negotiations with the company's chief executive, Michael Dell, and buyout firm Silver Lake about helping finance a deal to acquire the company, currently valued at almost $23bn, according to theCNBCnetwork.Microsoft has yet to make headway against Apple and Google's Android operating system in the smartphone market, and sales of portable devices are beginning to stifle the PC market, threatening its core business. The group is said to be considering spending some of its $66bn cash reserves on an investment in Dell of between $1bn and $3bn, in a deal which could be announced by the end of the week. The commitment could take the form of a loan rather than an equity stake.Global sales of PCs fell by 13m last year, the first drop since the dotcom crash produced a temporary dip in 2001. The software group has taken stakes in other companies in the past, including Apple and, more recently Facebook.Juliette Garside
Every morning, two articulated lorries filled with letters and paperwork pull into the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). It's a fact that Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, perhaps finds a little irritating. As the minister charged with improving the digital delivery of services, to him those articulated trucks are a symbol of the gap yet to be crossed by his office's efforts."There's almost nothing DVLA does that couldn't be done digitally," he told the Guardian in an exclusive interview. "Yet a huge amount is still being done on paper. There are huge numbers of people running a clerical paper processing factory."Maude isn't making a criticism of the DVLA itself, which has made vast strides in the past few years to make its services available online – so that you can now renew your car tax disc ("I did mine the other day, took three minutes," says Maude) or even update your driving licence without having to leave your front room.But for Maude, it's a symbol of what remains to be done. "Three-quarters of car insurance renewals are done online," he points out. "If you can get 20% of people doing something, you should be able to get to 80%."Equally though he is happy with some of the dividends that digital delivery, and a renewed focus on costs, is bringing. "The cost of technology has plummeted," he said. "We retendered the hosting for a small part of government recently, and the incumbent systems integrator bid £4m, while a UK SME [small/medium-sized enterprise] bid £60,000. That's a 98.5% saving. That's massive." The SME got the business. But despite – or perhaps because of – cost differentials such as that, Maude says "people are worried about doing it differently. There's a comfort in the size of big suppliers, despite the poor record some have for delivery – and costs from some bidders that seem too good to be true."Maude on Monday spoke to a government conference at which he was lauding the successes of the group led by Mike Bracken, the digital director at the Cabinet Office which is trying to make the government "digital by default" – rather as newspapers are trying to remould themselves to the digital world by thinking of the web before print.In his speech to the conference, Maude said: "This government has made it a priority to bring Whitehall into the 21st century. And as you will see and hear today – the digital transformation of government has begun. We are catching up with the private sector, with plans to build simple, fast, cost-effective online services that are designed around the user's needs."At the moment the government provides more than 650 transactional services serving about 1 billion users per year – but there are only a handful where a large majority of people who could use the online option do so. Half don't offer a digital option at all – and apart from a handful of services, if there is a digital option few people use it because it's not sufficiently fast or convenient."But although government has the capacity — as with the workers re-entering data into a computer from paper at the DVLA — Maude pointed out that "the average cost of a digital transaction is almost 20 times lower than the cost of a telephone transaction, about 30 times lower than the cost of [a] postal transaction and about 50 times lower than a face-to-face transaction."Even so not all of the bugs are yet out. "A vast number of phone calls to government services are from people who tried an online service and it failed," he told the Guardian. Speaking to the conference, he said: "we are determined to build fast, clear, simple digital services that are so good that people who are online will choose to use them."Departments such as HM Revenue and Customs, the Home Office, Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), Ministry of Justice, Department of Transport, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)  have been chosen to put a key number of their transactions online.That move, announced in November,could save billions in the coming years, according to the government's calculations.The biggest success so far has been the shift to the "gov.uk" portal for transactions with government, Maude said: "Gov.uk is simpler, clearer and faster for users looking for government services and information. And it costs taxpayers up to £50m less per year than the services it replaces."Equally, though, Maude recognises that not everyone will be able to –or want to – go online to carry out transactions: 18% of the population isn't online. "This does not mean we will neglect the people who do not have online access – every single government service will still be available to everyone through our assisted digital programme that will ensure no one is left behind," he said in the speech. But you get the sense he will only be really happy when those two articulated lorries that presently pull into the DVLA's offices transmute into a single van — holding just one sack. It might take a while, though.
Apple is forecast to report the first fall in profits since its financial turnaround a decade ago, as its period of "hyper growth" comes to an end.Wall Street analysts believe demand for the iPhone 5 has been lower than expected, and are forecasting on average that net income will have slipped 2% to $12.8bn (£8.1bn) during the last quarter compared with the same period last year.Apple, which reveals its first quarter results, which includes the Christmas period on Wednesday, has a track record of beating forecasts and could prove analysts wrong. It has not seen profits fall since its last loss making spell in 2003, before the company's success with music players set it on a massive growth trajectory.The iPad mini could also be taking a bite out of profits. It is selling well but brings in less profit a unit than the larger version of Apple's tablet device and may be suppressing demand for the original iPad.Revenues from October to December are projected to have risen 18% to $54.8bn, according to a Bloomberg poll of analysts, a growth rate which would satisfy investors in most other companies but marks the slowest increase at Apple since 2009."It will no longer be the hyper-growth company of the last five years, but rather a premium, branded consumer company, along the lines of Nike, Louis Vuitton and Saks," said Toni Sacconaghi at broker firm Sanford C Bernstein.He calculates that if Apple's continued expanding at its current pace for another five years, its annual revenues would reach $1.2 trillion, nearly the size of the Australia's GDP.The iPhone 5 is likely to have been the world's best selling phone in the last quarter. But as Apple's most profitable gadget and lower sales would impact margins.The device generates a hefty 55% margin, according to an estimate by Nomura. The bank is forecasting net income profits of $12.2bn for Apple, down from $13.1bn a year ago, and has cut its overall iPhone sales estimate by 2m to 48m for the three months from October to December."iPhone margins are unsustainably high and will fall," said Stuart Jeffrey at Nomura. He added that LG Display, which makes screens Apple, was expected to see a 50% fall in orders from its largest customer in the first three months of 2013. Apple is transferring business from LG to Sharp, but Jeffrey says half of the decline is owing to disappointing sale trends.The smaller iPad may not only be suppressing demand for Apple's bigger tablet, but could also be taking spending power away from the iPhone, said Neil Mawston at the research firm Strategy Analytics. "One of the key things we will be looking for is whether the iPad mini has canibalised full iPad volumes or even full iPhone volumes."
What of the future of search?Albert Wenger of Union Square Ventureswent out on a limb at the DLD13 conference on Tuesday to predict that Google will not be able to retain such a dominant market share, and pointed out that Microsoft already has a 15% share of the US search market with Bing.Being default search provider on many Windows 8 machines is a factor in that: "Google is losing the OEM [companies who buy in components from others] search deal," he said. "Search is so big that Google cannot retain that market share. It makes sense for Microsoft to retain its share, even if it is slow growing. It's a sensible place they have to go."In mobile search – a critical growth area – does Google need to screw up for another player to get a look in? "Head-on competition with Google will be hard, but something smart will peel off the side," said Wenger, referring to tracking-free search siteDuckDuckGo[in which Wenger's company Union Squarehas invested]."One of the things that has changed on the internet in the last few years are the pools of knowledge like StackExchange, Yelp and Foursquare. That's knowledge around specialist domains, and DuckDuckGo is partnering with those pools. Unlike Google, DuckDuckGo has no competitive properties," he added.Is voice search really going to catch on, or is it some sort of consensual hallucination by the tech industry? Rockmelt's head of business developmentPhilip Inghelbrechtsaid Google is on a three-year mission to change how consumers search."I think they will succeed in that," Inghelbrecht added. "What comes next? Step out of the paradigm of search as we know it – before I start driving my car knows [from my calendar] I am on my way to San Francisco, gives me the route and updates my wife to tell her when I will be home so I don't have to phone her. Combine that with voice and that is really one step ahead."In television – and particularly smart television – search is being held up by incumbent TV companies, contended tech bloggerHenry Blodget. "Everybody wants a search interface on TV that just gives you what you want when you want it. Can anybody do anything about those greedy cable companies?" Blodget said."That's not a search problem but a rights issue, and it's beginning to solve itself," said Wenger. "In startups when I ask who has a cable subscription, nobody has. I've got three kids that use YouTube, Vudu and on demand, and they never feel they can't get what they are looking for."
"How many of you are creative?" askedJohn Maeda of the Rhode Island School of Designat aDLD13 conferencesession on Tuesday. "How many of you are leaders? And how many of you are creative leaders?"Creative people don't think of themselves as leaders, yet during times of transition and when things need to change, creative people are not afraid to take on challenges, to disrupt and to make things. His point was to introduce architectZaha Hadid, who took the stage at DLD to receive the Aenne Burda award for creative leadership.Hadid's architectural partnerPatrik Schumacherexplained the patterns that formed their unique style. In 1975 – a critical period for architecture – modernism was rejected in place of nostalgic historical references, and formalism. Hadid recalls being told by one tutor that she was "obsessed with geometry" in a tone that was far from complimentary, but praised its forces on ideas and conceptualisation."The assumption was that modernism was too abstract, and there were those that wanted to radicalise abstraction," said Schumacher, adding that Hadid was drawn to the Russian avant-garde, but also to nature. "It was a certain radicalised, digitised nature, the ability to pick up on natural analogies using algorithms to generate form. It brought organic forms into the domain of sophistication through digital tools."Hadid travels to Beijing every six months and has relished being part of a landscape that has embraced such radical change so quickly. But in Europe, the climate is more restrained. "Across Germany, they need to go a bit wild. I don't mean in any way that Germans are uptight, but for a long time in Europe they thought there is only one kind of order and one kind of rationale that would overrule everything," she said.German cities, she said, need to move away from one typology; one commission in Dusseldorf endured a painstaking approval process because planners had to measure every triangle. "They thought a triangle was a waste of space, and not rational," said Hadid.

The British company TweetDeck Ltd, which was bought by Twitter so it could gain control of the multi-column app for viewing the social networking site, will soon cease to exist as an independent entity after Companies House moved to strike it off its register.But the app itself will continue as part of Twitter itself, which now owns the intellectual property and employs the staff who had been working on the product.TweetDeck, the company, became one of the iconic names for the regrowth of the UK's technology industry focussed on social media in locations around London's Old Street – an area later dubbed Silicon Roundabout.The letter from Companies House, firsthighlighted by Sky News, said the company will be struck off in three months and forcibly dissolved unless it files accounts. Those were due in September.That follows a statutory warning earlier this month from Companies House, which regulates the activities of all companies registered in the UK, that TweetDeck could be struck off because it had not filed accounts for the year ending March 2011.TweetDeck, set up in 2008 by Iain Dodsworth, wasbought in May 2011by Twitter for a rumoured $40m, apparently to head off competition from would-be advertising sellers on the network.The closure of TweetDeck Ltd would have no effect on Twitter or TweetDeck, the app, because the assets of the UK company have been acquired by the larger US company.

Tuesday! How are you coping with the weather? Having fun?
A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamMoore's Law won't kill passwords &gt;&gt; Light Blue TouchpaperJoseph Bonneau, at the Cambridge University computer security research lab:Inmy thesisI charted 20 years of password cracking improvements and found an increase of about 1,000 in the number of guesses per second per unit cost that could be achieved, almost exactly a Moore's Law-style doubling every two years. The good news though is that password hash functions can (and should) co-evolve to get proportionately costlier to evaluate over time. This is a classic arms race and keeping pace simply requires regularly increasing the number of iterations in a password hash. We can even improve against password cracking over time using memory-bound functions, because memory speeds aren't increasing nearly as quickly and are harder to parallellise. Thescrypt() key derivation functionis a good implementation of a memory-bound password hash and every high security application should be using it or something similar.Stephen Hawking's New PC &gt;&gt; Intel Free PressIntel application engineer Travis Bonifield has been working closely with Hawking to communicate with the world for a decade.

The IP address in use matched a line in McFarlin's apartment in nearby Alameda that was also being used by an Apple device registered to a member of his family, according to a police report.Is Kim Dotcom's new site, MEGA, really safer than MegaUpload? &gt;&gt; Daily DotThe new MEGA can provide better harbor to Internet pirates--provided they're careful.MEGA, the new file locker service created in the wake of MegaUpload's shuttering and ongoing legal trials, differs from its predecessor in a single important way (besides the fact that it's not currently the subject of a massive, multinational trial): Users can encrypt their files.While this won't change anything for those who would use the site to encourage broad piracy, people who just want to share pirated material with their friends are unlikely to be caught.That's not readily apparent. Those who sign up for the service, which goes public Saturday, are greeted with terms of service that make it seem they're likely to get into trouble if they upload pirated content.Gatecrashing Nintendo's girly gamer event, By a guy &gt;&gt; Gizmodo UKGrant Howitt:There is a couple on the balcony kissing.

They hope to grow a modest business focused on digital and mobile platforms, according to a knowledgeable person not authorized to discuss the matter privately.Although the 31-year-old brand is still known worldwide for its pioneering role with video games such as "Pong" and "Asteroids," Atari has been mired in financial problems for decades. Since the early 2000s it has been closely tied to French company Infogrames, which changed its name to Atari S.A. in 2003 and in 2008 acquired all the gaming pioneer's American assets.You can followGuardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard.

Google severely underestimated demand for its Nexus 4 smartphone, the French chief of south Korea's LG, which makes the handset, has told a French paper.Cathy Robin, director of LG Mobile France, also said thatestimates made by websites that fewer than 400,000 of the handsets had been shippedwere "much lower than the reality" - but did not to put a figure on shipments.However she said that Google had forecast high demand in the UK and in Germany than in France, for which she blamed shortages there. That however doesn't explain the shortages and delays suffered by would-be buyers in the UK.She said that LG is not making a loss on the handset but that "there is an agreement between Google and LG to sell it at a very compelling price."The interview continues a tit-for-tat in which LG, which has been trying to revive its fortunes after being crushed in the Android market by Samsung, HTC and Sony, was given the accolade of making the reference "Nexus" model by Google ahead of other Android manufacturers, and launched it in November 2012. But with frustrated buyers filling online forums, LG has been the target of complaints that it failed to ramp up supply quickly enough - an allegation that Robin has rebutted.Instead, she has put the blame back on Google in its forecasting.The handset, initially offered by Google through its Google Play website, is awell-regarded high-end phone using a "reference" version of Google's mobile Android software. Google offered it as the price of just £239 (8GB) or £279 (16GB) and €349 in Europe - but for £390 (16GB) or €630 through retail outlets and operators. That has led to complaints after the phone became almost immediately unavailable on Google Play after going on sale; before Christmas there was anapology from Google's UK managing director, who blamed LG's "scarce and erratic" supply for the shortage.But Robintold Challenges.frthat "supply problems are not necessarily completely related to LG. Google presented forecasts according to sales predictions, based on their sales history for the previous Nexus. However they were lower than the actual demand. The current shipments from LG to Google match what has been preordered on the Google Play site. We still ship them regularly. But it's 'just-in-time'. That's why the Nexus 4 is always in showing as sold out and potential buyers have the feeling they can't buy it."Increasing the pace of shipments would involve a six-week delay, she said - indicating the inertia in the supply chain between LG's factories and customers.She says that Nexus 4 production will continue, growing in amount, and that by February "there will no longer be any tension [between demand and supply] in the market."On whether LG's plans to offer Windows Phone handsets, Robin comments that "it's clearly not high priority. We are very pragmatic."
Legendary explorerReinhold Messnersaid he lost his enthusiasm for rock climbing and switched to mountain climbing after losing some of his toes to frostbite at 25.Hugh Herr, was also a well-known climber, but his own brush with death led to a career in bionics.Diversity is a mark ofDLD, so it was a pleasant surprise that Messner took the stage at the Munich conference on Monday alongside Herr, who is researching and developing advanced bionics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."It was actually nice that I didn't lose just my toes but lost my legs up to here," Herr said, gesturing towards two impressive looking prosthetics. "From here down I'm a blank canvas. I can go beyond what nature intended; I could extend my height to get more hand and footholds."Herr describes Darwinian as slow and bionics as a rapid evolution, the technology for which will be unimaginably sophisticated in 20 years.Messner, also appearing at DLD13, draws a line at modifications to the brain: "The brain is partly animal. Genetically there is the experience, and that instinctive part of my knowledge is more important for my behaviour in dangerous situations on the mountain than pure intelligence … without this instinct I would not be here."Both raised the point that the technology that has enabled Herr to climb again (using modified prosthetic feet for climbing) is only possible to a wealthy elite; Herr's limbs would cost $120,000 to buy, but are only possible because of $43m in research and development. Morally, said Herr, the solution would be geographically distributed manufacturing based on open source, IP-free designs.Furthermore, once augmentation is a possibility, how far does that go? "If you have the ability to correct depression via an electrical interface, how depressed do you have to be to have the intervention?" asked Herr. "Maybe they are producing great art or something … but do they have to be slightly depressed, or suicidal?"
Is the cyber security analystEugene Kasperskythe most dangerous man in the world? After more than 15 years researching cyber-crime and running the international online security firmKaspersky Lab, he is certainly the most paranoid.Cyber threats are developed as quickly as new technologies themselves, he told a session at theDLD13 conferencein Munich on Monday, and with computers now such a critical part of our infrastructure – from our smartphones and cars to national energy systems and even prisons – the potential for damage and danger is catastrophic.He points toStuxnet, which was confirmed as the culprit behind three incidents of cyber-terrorism: one in Estonia, one on an Iranian nuclear facility and one on oil companies in Saudi Arabia, which destroyed data on 30,000 computers. If viruses can damage hardware, as in 1998 and 1999 when 10,000 notebooks were destroyed with one virus, are we ready to reinstate human-operated mechanical control systems as roadblocks? It won't happen, but things are only going to get worse, he warns.Co-speakerMikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, dismisses the "happy teen hacker" image of the last decade. "In the late 1990s the enemy was simple – happy hackers writing for fun. Those days are behind us – now the hackers have motives."Hackers now are either criminals out to make money, activists out to protest or governments engaged in targeting their own citizens or attacking other governments, whether for espionage or cyberwarfare. Hypponen flashed up some mugshots of hackers, mostly convicted criminals and one Estonian who ran a rogue ISP that produced enough money to employ experienced hackers, fund its own servers, test and quality control on its malware. That level of resource and sophistication makes life very difficult for those charged with defending networks from attack, said Hypponen.The biggest threat, both agreed, is state involvement. Where a rogue phisher or malware attack might be the criminal equivalent of a street mugger, state-sponsored attacks come with all the resources and technological sophistication of James Bond. Resistance, if not futile, is extremely hard. Attacks are also very difficult to attribute to anyone; they could be written in a Chinese version of Word to make it appear the attack originated in China, or could be routed via Canada.We are at the beginning of a new and dangerous era of cyberwarfare, both concluded. Hypponen pointed out that it is essential to identify what kind of attack it is; governments should be encouraged to cooperate to defeat criminals, but will also be engaging in cyber espionage against each other.Karspersky was characteristically jolly, but painted a neurotic Alice in Wonderland scenario. "It's a totally new world and we are trying to work out how to behave in the right way. We are trying different doors and different drinks… that's the view of a paranoid man, but I do believe we will survive."
You don't expect to find one of the world's richest men riding the New York subway looking a little like a hobo. But last week, Sergey Brin, the co-founder with Larry Page of Google, wasphotographed by Noah Zerkin, who happens to be an enthusiast about augmented reality and wearable computing – which, as it happens, is what Brin was experimenting with down in the subway.Brin, 39, is in charge of the top-secret developments inside the "Google X" projects, while Page runs the company as the chief executive. One of those projects is "Google Glass" – wearable glasses which also include a screen showing computer data just at the edge of the field of vision of the right eye.Worth more than $15bn (£9bn)  based on his Google stockholding, Brin co-owns a Boeing 767 jet plane – but as the photo shows, he's also perfectly happy to take the underground, carrying a yellow plastic bag.Brin is wearing the glasses which, if connected to a wireless network, can feed in information about the scene in view, based on location data and Google search data. However,commented Zerkin, "I suspect that even the most powerful man in the world can't get [a] signal in the NYC subway."Brin has also been photographed on the streets of San Francisco using the Glass prototype, which looks like a pair of lightly shaded spectacles with slightly thicker sides. The computer inside is able to take photos and video of what the wearer is looking at and share them immediately online, or show information about the surroundings and possibly people you recognise.Zerkin certainly recognised Brin, andsaidhe had had "a brief conversation with the most powerful man in the world. On the downtown 3 train. Nice guy."Brin's appearance brought some comment: Nick Bilton of the New York Times commented that he looked "like an assassin". Mark Turetksyremarked: "He was probably playing [online game] Words With Friends during your conversation."Google Glass is expected to be made available to developers later this year, costing $1,500, and Google is inviting developers to "hackathons" in San Francisco later this year, and in New York at the beginning of February, to try to figure out interesting applications for the glasses. Brin has previously said the biggest problem has been the battery life, though Google is working on that.Brin showed off the potential of Google Glass last May at the Google I/O conference, when ateam of skydivers gave a live relay from the built-in camera on the glassesto the audience below.
Its distinctive logo has been familiar to gamers for more than 40 years, but the great survivor of the interactive entertainment industry is now facing another stern test. According to a press release issued on Monday, the US arm of Atari has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a bid to separate from its French parent company.According tothe LA Times:"Its leaders hope to break the American business free from French parent Atari SA and in the next few months find a buyer to take the company private. They hope to grow a modest business focused on digital and mobile platforms, according to a knowledgeable person not authorised to discuss the matter privately."The modern New York-based Atari Inc bears very little relation to the Atari Inc founded by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in 1972, which established itself with the classic bat-and-ball game Pong. From there, the company went on to dominate the early console era, shifting around 30m units of its wood-paneled Atari 2600 machine. The company was sold to Warner Bros in 1976, but the failure of later consoles, as well as the Atari ST home computer, saw the legend passed between a succession of different owners. In 2000 it was bought by French publisher Infogrames, which changed its name to Atari and hoped to cash in on the company's vast roster of classic brands including Pong, Breakout and Centipede.Now concentrating on repackaging those classic Atari titles for the growing smartphone and tablet markets, Atari Inc is apparently making a profit, but growth is being hampered, not just by its loss-making French parent, but by a reliance on London-based finance firm, BlueBay Asset Management. According to the LA Times:"A $28m credit facility with BlueBay lapsed 31 December, leaving Atari without the resources to release games currently in the works, including a real-money gambling title titled Atari Casino."Of course, fans of Bladerunner will know that the Atari brand is set to survive for at least another six years: the company's logo is clearly visible on a shop front in one scene of Ridley Scott's noir thriller.

Flippancy aside, NewsWhip is an interesting addition to the massed ranks of such apps, claiming to scan "a billion people on Facebook and Twitter" to see which stories are popular right now, then serving them up in category-based streams.iPhone / iPadRolling Stone Magazine (Free)Only available in the US for now – a shame given its global reputation – Rolling Stone magazine finally has its own iPad app. Charging $1.99 a month, $19.99 a year or $4.99 per issue, it's a replica of the print edition with added streaming samples of songs and iTunes Store links.iPadKingdom Conquest II (Free)Remember when Sega's Super Monkey Ball was the first big hit in the App Store's early days? Now the veteran publisher is finding its way in the free-to-play market too, with strategy game Kingdom Conquest having been a sizeable hit. This sequel mixes up card-battling, real-time strategy and 3D dungeoneering, with in-app purchases funding your ambitions.iPhone / iPadHerd Absurd! (£1.99)Herd Absurd! is a characterful take on those children's books where you flip sections of the page to put different heads, bodies and legs of characters together. Here, it's animals that your kids will be mixing and matching, with suitably-cheeky animations making them smile along the way.iPhone / iPadFinal Fantasy All The Bravest (£2.49)I have mixed feelings including this game. It's certainly notable: a brand new Final Fantasy action-strategy game designed for mobile. Yet it's also one of the more controversial exponents of in-app purchases in recent memory: not just charging 69p to unlock "premium" characters – there are 35 to collect but you get a random one each time – but also charging for hourglasses needed to re-enter battles quickly when you get defeated.iPhone / iPadCar Jack Streets: Directors Cut (Free)Openly inspired by the original top-down Grand Theft Auto games, Car Jack Streets was an early hit on the App Store. Now it's been rebooted as a free-to-play game, as you drive around Jack City completing nefarious missions to pay off your Mob debts.iPhone / iPadRiven for iPad (£3.99)Several games out in the last week will be giving gamers of a certain age a nostalgic glow. Riven is the sequel to adventure game Myst, with a similarly-enormous footprint on your iOS device – 1.93GB. It looks an accurate conversion of the original PC game, which sees you exploring a beautiful-looking world.iPadBritain in 2013 magazine (£3.99)Britain in 2013? Freezing! But thankfully Immediate Media's new app has its sights set on loftier topics than a spot of snow. It aims to showcase "the state of the nation through the realm of social science", from climate change (okay, a bit on snow) through to police behaviour, our ageing society and educational reforms.iPhone / iPadPinYinPal (Free)iPad app PinYinPal looks a lot like Words With Friends (well, Scrabble, obviously) but it's actually got even-more educational ambitions. It's actually an app for learning Chinese through play, as you use letters of the alphabet to spell traditional Mandarin characters. A clever idea that looks good for anyone learning Chinese.iPadAmerican Idol Official (Free)It's a little while before X Factor fever strikes again in the UK, but over in the US the viewing public are already gearing up for the new American Idol series. It's got a very slick second-screen app too, with voting, social feeds, video clips and news on the contestants and judges.iPhone / iPadGroupVox (Free)A few years ago, the idea of Push-To-Talk (PTT for short) was all the rage among some mobile operators, who thought adding walkie-talkie features to phones was The Future. It wasn't. Can the idea make a comeback with apps? GroupVox hopes so: it's a walkie-talkie app for talking to your Facebook friends, including the ability to record messages for people when they're offline.iPhoneConor Maynard (Free)Increasingly, music artists' apps are going beyond pure news, tweets and iTunes links, which is good. In the case of youthful star Conor Maynard, his app's twist is a photo-sharing feature that puts him in the photo with you, lets you scribble your own messages on top (OMG!) then share to social networks.iPhonePitchero (Free)A few companies have had a bash at creating connected sports apps, withFanatixbeing the most high-profile here in the UK. Now Pitchero is entering the market, but with a wider focus on sports clubs at all levels, including non-league. Its app offers news, fixtures, tables, photos and videos and other content from more than 10,000 clubs.iPhoneJongla (Free)More messaging, but this time the instant variety. Jongla is a new cross-platform messaging app with hopes (even if they're slim hopes) of taking on WhatsApp and the like. Sharing photos and locations is included, and the app uses push notifications to ensure messages aren't missed.iPhoneHeroes and Castles (£1.49)There are more orcs, goblins and giants than you can shake a (great big flaming) stick at in this impressive castle-defence game, which throws in action-RPG elements to put you in the heart of the battle. It sees you taking on hordes of monsters while upgrading your castle walls and buildings to keep your army in spiffing condition.iPhone / iPadThe Land of Me - Shape, Size and Colour (£1.99)British startup Made In Me has been exploring interactive children's fiction with its The Land of Me apps, scooping a BAFTA nomination in the process. This latest example focuses on, yes, shapes, sizes and colours as kids create monsters, animals and vehicles.iPadFive Little Monkeys Play Hide and Seek (£1.49)Here's another app for kids, this time from US publisher Oceanhouse Media (of Dr. Seuss apps fame). It's a digital version of a book starring five cheeky monkeys trying to get out of bedtime by playing games. Expect rhyming text, lots of chances to practise counting, and a mixture of voice narration and word-highlighting to help young readers.iPhone / iPadThe Sun Smile (Free)Also covered last weekin a standalone story, this is a new appy spin-off from The Sun newspaper, serving up "the day's funniest stories" in a free app, tying in with News International's latest marketing campaign.iPhoneCrazy Blind Date by OKCupid (Free)Better when used in the US than in the UK by all accounts, but still an interesting launch. Released by dating website OKCupid, this strips the idea of online dating down to suggesting a time and place, then seeing who's in the area for a speedy blind date there.iPhoneAmazing Alex Free (Free)It seems harsh to criticise Rovio's Amazing Alex for not being an Angry Birds-sized hit, given thatnothinghas been an Angry Birds-sized hit apart from Angry Birds. Now the puzzler is getting a second lease of life as a cut-down free title, with 16 levels to play before deciding whether to upgrade to the full version's 100+ puzzles.iPhone / iPadMedical Recorder (Free)There are all sorts of hurdles to jump before new technology can be adopted across the board by doctors and the medical professions. Still, some individuals – and medical students in particular – may be attracted by this app, which helps them take voice notes, text and images when treating patients.iPhoneKu: Shroud of the Morrigan (£1.49)Dublin developer bitSmith games has a hit on its hands in its native Ireland with Ku: Shroud of the Morrigan, but the game deserves a wider audience too. It's an action-RPG with plenty of monsters and puzzles to negotiate, but its appeal is as much in its lovely hand-drawn graphics.iPadD.O.T. Defender of Texel (Free)Here's a game from Japanese social games giant DeNA (well, its Mobage subsidiary) which sees you doing battle with robots and dragons in a pixelly 8-bit universe. Your job is to explore the world, evolve your characters and tinker with battle formations to get the best results.iPhoneTomo Garage (£0.69)There are dozens – if not hundreds – of independent developers making quirky, fun apps for children. Thats Junior is one of them with Tomo Garage, which sees kids playing a letter-blocks game to collect virtual items, which they can then play with. No in-app purchases involved.iPhone / iPadBlue Stage by Sennheiser (Free)Blue Stage is an iPad magazine for audiophiles, created by audio firm Sennheiser. With a new issue due every month, it'll offer a mixture of features, videos and music promising to "turn you from the average sound buff into a fully-fledged sound connoisseur".iPadUnderground Kingdom (£1.99)We've covered retro games, but what about retro game-books? Underground Kingdom is an attempt to rethink the Choose Your Own Adventure books that were all the rage in the 1980s. That means a story – complete with artwork and animation – with choices for you to make along the way to decide how it progresses.iPadOrSaveIt (Free)This is a great idea for anyone whose new year's resolution is "stop blowing my salary on booze / fags / CDs / other consumable goods that, let's face it, aren't going to make me happy in the long run (possibly)". The idea: you choose an amount of money that you want to save, and then tell the app every time you DON'T spend money on a range of things – which counts up against your saving goal.iPhoneDataMan Next (£0.69)DataMan Next could also be a handy money-saver, but this time to track data usage on your iPhone in real-time, so you know when you're in danger of going over your limit. Colourful alerts make it even clearer when you're at risk of slamming into per-MB charges.iPhoneChromasphere (£0.69)Steering balls around multi-levelled, ahem, levels has a long and rich history on all gaming platforms, so Chromasphere has a reassuringly familiar feel. It uses the accelerometer to guide its sphere through a series of obstacle-strewn levels.iPhone / iPadThat's our selection, but what have you been using on your iOS device recently? Make your recommendations with a comment, or pass judgement on the apps above.
How smart is smart TV? Anyone who has grappled with the clumsy, cluttered menus of their new multi-functional flatscreens would be forgiven some disappointment. This isn't the TV-meets-internet promise, surely?Either TV manufacturers really don't understand how to create a decent internet TV experience, or they are eking out every last penny by releasing incrementally "smartened" TVs over many years.It is almost certainly the latter. That's all a roadblock, however, to the next era of content, one that brings together the diversity and interaction of online content with the quality and adverting security of traditional TV distribution.Glam's chief executive, Samir Arora, speaking at smart TV session on Monday at theDLD13 conferencein Munich, said that until 18 months ago, the company's advertising had been comparable to print media, with specialist advertisers chasing specialist audience communities. But when Glam hit scale (it reaches 110 million US users each month and 500 million globally across 1,800 brands) it suddenly became interesting to broadcast advertisers and big brands.What the internet offers those advertisers, he said, that is better than TV advertising is intelligent targeting: "On the smart internet, you should not see an ad for a car if you have just bought a car. Bring that forward and consumers will get used to it – it will make advertising something people want, targeted and packaged carefully."Arora described the perception of Glam in the past as an online-only business, which, he said, is even now still put down as a "digital pennies" business. A decade ago, they realised this attitude was partly because they weren't recruiting "the Anna Wintours", but a level below that. Now, that has changed, and Glam's business has exceeded not just Vogue's website but Vogue's print business.The key questions for self-preservation should be: is there fragmentation in this medium, and is there potential for re-aggregation?ProSiebenSat's chief digital officer, Christian Wegner, who was stubbornly defensive of cable TV, insisted that television is still the only medium with real reach and status for advertisers. That's because of quality content, he said, quoting the $2bn (£1.2bn) ProSiebenSat spent on content in Germany in one year, compared to the $100m YouTube spent in the US. But he described a future where that authority could be combined, through smart TV, with ads targeted by region, town or even interests.What smart TV needs to crack, said Arora, is discovery. "In the cable business, you have access to power and place that the user will need. But the people who are best at content discovery today, that's not the guide – it is Apple, then Facebook, then Twitter and then maybe Google (they are good at search but not discovery)."Look at the visibility problem for most apps and you can see that Apple doesn't always get it right, but look at what it did for music. Arora, it should be said, used to work for Apple.Even in smart TV, all roads lead to social.

Sorry for the delay to Chatterbox. This has been caused by icy conditions on the internet.
Danny Kellysays good riddance to HMVbecause it was sickly for some years before it died. I suggest however that the fact it took time to die does not make its loss (and that of its high street competitors) any less regrettable. What replaced them is a disaster for freedom.I miss stores like HMV because I could go there with cash, buy records (usually CDs), and take them home as mine. These large stores had a wide range of music, and I could listen to records in-store (mostly music I had never heard of) to find what I liked. Once I had bought the records, I was free to give or lend them to friends. Under copyright law, I could even copy them, to audio tapes in the old days, and give those to my friends. All this without the state's knowing anything about it.You can't buy music that way on the internet. You are forced to identify yourself to the seller (and to Big Brother, watching over his shoulder) -- and if it's not a CD, you have to sign a restrictive contract whichdenies you the rights we all enjoyed. I say "you" because I won't go there.For those who love both music and freedom, today's form of internet sales is out of the question, which leaves ever fewer opportunities for us to buy music. Aside from disks sold by musicians, and a few surviving large record stores such as Amoeba in San Francisco, the only way a self-respecting person should get copies of music is through digital sharing.The superficial convenience of internet music sales is the bait; in the UK, the Digital Economy Act is the jaws. And HMV was the safe and ethical road to music, which a society focused on the short term has not kept open.Copyright 2013 Richard Stallman.

Apple prefers surprises. Speculation – often informed – is always rife before the company makes its latest announcements, but the computer giant itself never comments. On Wednesday, Apple boss Tim Cook may have another surprise in store, although it has been predicted by many – the tech firm's first decline in profits for nine years.Things have been difficult for Apple recently. Its shares have lost 20% in the last three months and they closed on Friday at $500, down from an all-time high of $705.07 when the iPhone 5 launched last September.Shares in Apple have been largely on the slide since that launch, marred by an unpopular decision to drop Google Maps for the company's own own botched version that left navigators three times more likely to get lost, according to one survey. Executive heads rolled.There was speculation last week that the company had cut back on suppliers – suggesting that iPhone sales had slipped. Apple changes suppliers often and may, according to other rumours, be planning to use new glass technology on its devices. With no comment from the company, Apple's shares slid again.And yet, for all these issues, Apple is widely expected to have sold close to 50m iPhones last quarter – another record – and fans can't get enough of its iPad and iPad Mini. The company remains the most valuable on the planet.This is a tale of two Apples. One, fans argue, is set to continue to redefine business in the way companies like General Motors and IBM did in their heyday. The other, for critics, is an over-hyped phone manufacturer which is about to be caught up by reality.Walter Piecyk, analyst at BTIG, is firmly in the latter camp. He downgraded Apple's stock to neutral from buy last April – a move that looks like smart timing now. Piecyk predicts Apple will have another record setting quarter in sales for the company and close to an 80% increase in iPhone sales from the September period, when sales were hit by customers held off in anticipation of the new phone.But it's not this quarter's sales that worry him. What worries Piecyk is Apple's "compressed product cycle". The company could once rely on growing sales for its hit products even after their hype-fueled launches. The Apple fever is still there – huge lines formed at Apple stores around the world for the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini. But there are now worrying signs that Apple has lost the ability to build on the momentum of those launches.Apple launched its iPhone 3Gs in June 2009. In the June quarter it sold 5.2m iPhones, in the September quarter it sold 7.4m, in December 8.7m and another 8.7m in the quarter after that. The pattern repeated itself with the iPhone 4, launched in June 2010. In the September quarter Apple sold 14m iPhones, in December they sold 16.2m and in March 18.6m.Apple is selling far more iPhones these days in more markets but sales are falling after launch. When the iPhone 4S was launched in late 2011, sales hit 37m in the December quarter – up nearly 120% from the preceding period. Sales then dropped over the next two quarters."It is selling in more markets than before and sales fall off more quickly than before," Piecyk said, adding: "Frankly they have no choice."For a while Apple had the smartphone and the tablet locked up. Now Samsung, HTC and others have products that generate as much buzz. "They can't wait now. If you wait you are selling an old phone," Piecyk said.Early sales tend to be less profitable for the company as returns are higher due to teething issues. But Apple can no longer rely on mounting sales to set off those costs. The speed of launches and level of competition is only increasing and for Piecyk, Apple is the likely loser.Horace Dediu, an Asymco analyst, has roughly the same numbers as BTIG but he couldn't disagree more. There are technical reasons that the quarter may underwhelm – this quarter is a week shorter than last year's comparable quarter and the company had two launches to contend with – but fundamentally, he says, Apple remains a stellar performer with room to grow."The global appetite for devices is measure in billions of units," he said. "The numbers of units Apple is shipping remain relatively small."He expects that Apple will launch a new series of iPhones aimed a more cost-conscious buyers. It's a model Apple has pursued before, with the iPod, and one that it looks to be following with the iPad. "Samsung has 37 smartphones," he said. A new family of cut-price Apple phones could bring a Apple a massive new market.Apple's problem, he believes, is one of perception. "What Apple does – make hit, blockbuster products – is seen as unrepeatable," he said. "The iMac is not repeatable, the iPod is not repeatable, the iPhone, the iPad. See the pattern?" He predicts that Apple will come up with other "unrepeatable" products. TV is the most often touted target.The company has not launched an entirely new product since the death of its founder, Steve Jobs. For a company whose share price has been driven by anticipation of a new blockbuster, that is an issue. Cook is in need of some new surprises, ones that prove Apple hasn't lost its spark.
Dell could be taken private in a $22bn (£14bn) deal this week as the mounting crisis in the PC market forces one of the world's largest technology companies to switch from making computers to providing information technology services.The buyout, led by private equity group Silver Lake Management and Dell's founder and chief executive, Michael Dell, would be the largest leveraged takeover since the banking crisis struck in 2007.Last year the number of personal computers Dell shipped to retailers shrank by 12%, and its stock market value slipped by a third. The problem is industry-wide: shipments from all manufacturers fell by nearly 13m in 2012 – the first drop since the end of the dotcom crash in 2001.While sales quickly recovered at the turn of the century, this time the PC's decline looks irreversible. Consumers are switching their attention to tablets and smartphones, and none of the world's five largest makers of desktop computers have a significant business in these devices."Whereas once we imagined a world in which individual users would have both a PC and a tablet, we increasingly suspect that most will shift to a personal tablet," said analyst Mikako Kitagawa at Gartner. "Most buyers will not replace secondary PCs in the household, instead allowing them to age out."PCs account for 70% of Dell's revenues and more than half of its profits. If it is to survive, it must shift its dependence away from laptops and focus on the more nebulous business services that have made companies such as IBM successful: building and managing servers, software in the cloud, and data centre equipment.Having founded the world's third-biggest maker of personal computers in 1984, Michael Dell remains chief executive and chairman and controls nearly 16% of the company. The attempt to take his company off the Nasdaq stock exchange suggests he believes the difficult transition is best performed behind Silver Lake's closed doors."The rationale at this time appears to be that sentiment around the PC business and Dell is overly pessimistic, and that Michael Dell is willing to bet that his enterprise strategy is going to be highly successful," wrote Bernstein Research analyst Tony Sacconaghi.The deal is "feasible", he believes, because Dell could switch the cash it pays in dividends to meet the interest on the loan needed to take the firm private. The result would be "one of the larger LBOs [leveraged buyouts] in history".To buy Dell, Silver Lake has lined up at least four banks to provide an estimated $15bn in financing, according to Bloomberg. The lenders include Credit Suisse Group, Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays and Bank of America, and the price being offered is reported to be between $13.50 and $14 a share.News of the talks broke last Monday, sending Dell's shares up 18%. They closed at $12.84 on Friday night, valuing the company at over $22bn.Attempting to fix Dell while it remained on the Nasdaq would be like trying to repair a race car that was still running, rather than one that was parked in the workshop, said analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group."If they can get out from underneath the massive amount of reporting and scrutiny a public company is under, it would make them much more agile and able to take the kind of risks Michael Dell would like to take to transform the company," he said.
The internet entrepeneur Kim Dotcom boasted on Sunday that his new file-sharing service, Mega, was the fastest-growing startup in internet history.In a bravado-filled launch at his estate north of Auckland, the German-born entrepreneur ramped up his counterattack on US prosecutors who argue that the site's predecessor, Megaupload, was at the heart of a "mega conspiracy", a "worldwide criminal organisation" enabling the exchange of copyright material."I've never seen anything like this," Dotcom said at an event that was equal parts press conference, polemic and buffoonery. "I've done a bit of PR and got a bit of attention, that's certainly helped. But I never expected 250,000 user registrations in the first two hours – I think it's unheard of. I don't know of any other startup that has had this kind of early success."The site had more than a million visits in the first 14 hours, he said, with more than half a million registering for the service, which offers 50GB of free cloud-based data storage.The launch was held at Dotcom's semi-rural home a year to the day after it was raided by New Zealand police in what was widely regarded as a bizarrely gung-ho operation at the behest of the FBI.As if the timing and rhetoric were not enough, the import of the new enterprise was hammered home in an at times high-camp performance featuring a mock invasion of the estate, with gun-waving, balaclava-clad commandos descending the inner walls while a helicopter with "FBI" painted on the sides flew overhead.Earlier a pair of comperes introduced Dotcom on stage as "a multimillionaire maniac, heavyweight champion, three-time Academy Award winner and qualified veterinarian".US authorities are seeking the extradition of Dotcom and several of his associates to face charges of conspiracy to commit copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. Backed by Hollywood producers, they allege that Megaupload knowingly and willingly profited from the provision of a conduit for the exchange of pirated copyright materials. The US case has suffered aseries of setbacksin New Zealand's courts.The Motion Picture Association of America expressed scepticism about Mega. "We are still reviewing how this new project will operate, but we do know that Kim Dotcom has built his career and his fortune on stealing creative works," it said.Dotcom says advanced encryption built into the new site is in part motivated by his growing awareness of the importance of privacy issues. In aninterview with the Guardianbefore the Mega launch, he positioned himself as a leader in the movement for "internet freedom", and said his own experience of being illegally spied on – which resulted in a public apology from New Zealand's prime minister – had informed his thinking.On Sunday night Dotcom said Megaupload had been unfairly targeted, and asserted that half of all internet traffic was pirated material. "They are trying to blame us for an internet phenomenon … You can ask any ISP that connects users to the internet, how much piracy traffic do you think you have on your network, and anyone who will tell you less than 50% is a liar. On the internet, piracy is so common that any internet company has to deal with the same issues," he said."They can't blame me for the actions of third parties. Megaupload was a dual-use technology. You can use it for good things, and you can use it for bad things. If someone sends something illegal in an envelope through your postal service, you don't shut down the post office. If someone speeds with the car he just bought, you don't go to the car manufacturer and say, hey, we're shutting you down."
Price£28,475MPG49.6Top speed123mphThe grumpy driver of the school bus looked surprised when I tapped on his window. I was a bit surprised myself, actually. But I was annoyed. "Your engine has been idling for 45 minutes," I said. "The whole time I've been swimming you've been parked here, going nowhere." There was a silence while he gathered his thoughts, his sandwich hovering mid-air. "It's a&nbsp;waste of fuel," I almost shouted. "It's crazy." More silence, just the relentless gurgle of his diesel. Then he leaned forward and turned the key. Silence. He smiled at me and took a big bite. "Thanks," I mumbled, and walked away, thinking what an unbearable prig I must be…But there is a more serious point. Research forTransport for Londonhas revealed that if all the capital's drivers turned their engines off when idling for one lousy minute on each journey they made, the city could reduce its carbon emissions by 100 million kg a year and about £60m less fuel would be burned. It's a gloriously easy, small individual change that would make a massive collective difference.  So why not? Let's embrace the silence…But it's harder than you think. All of us who have ever driven cars that were not fit for purpose – the smoke chuggers, the oil burners, the rust bloomers – know that the first rule of motoring preservation is to never, ever turn your engine off once you've got it started. It may never start again.However, things have moved on and rather than revving your engine to keep it from dying, modern cars can be switched on and off with equanimity. The car I&nbsp;have been driving this week,Volkswagen's newPassat AllTrack, goes a step further. It turns its own engine off every time you stop, soundlessly restarting it the moment you lift your foot from the brake. And it's just one of many  clever technologies on this most driveable of VWs.With its raised ride height, four-wheel drive, flared arches and metal bash plates, the AllTrack (maybe it should have been called the Attack?) is the pumped-up, gym-bunny version of the better-known born-to-serve Passat. Heavier and chunkier, much has been done to keep fuel efficiency on a par with the family model. The 4MOTION drive unit sends 90% of the 2.0-litre diesel's power to the front wheels, but if a loss of grip is detected, it's automatically redirected to the rear axle. That saves petrol without compromising off-road performance, while on the road it offers a&nbsp;responsive and engaging drive.There's a stack of gadgetry on the options list, too – sweeteners to help seal the deal, such as lane assist, blind-spot monitoring, self parking and auto-dip headlights. Book a test drive and your mind will be made up in minutes. Mine was. In speed-dating parlance it's a double tick – from you and from your future date.But there's always a niggle, isn't there? A plastic handle used to adjust seat height came off in my hand and the music system has a mind of its own… But they're hardly deal breakers. Would I&nbsp;consider a second date? Just tell me where and when.Toy story: Britain's best-selling carTeam GB: the best-selling Little Tyles Cozy Coupe. Photograph: ObserverAs theSociety of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders(SMMT) announces its annual figures for the UK New Car registration 2012, toy companyLittle Tikesis celebrating because its iconic Cozy Coupe toy car hasdriven off with the top spot. The company, owned by US toy giant MGA Entertainment, sold 156,693 Cozy Coupes in the UK alone, placing it in pole position ahead of the Ford Fiesta, which saw 109,265 new registrations in 2012. Furthermore, Little Tikes reports it has seen a boost in sales of Cozy Coupes of some 25,000 vehicles compared to its 2011 figures. Much of this down to the introduction of the GB Coupe – a new model sporting a smart Union Flag on the roof – which had some bumper sales months around the times of the Jubilee and the Olympics. And the fact that it is one of Britain's cheapest cars – just £54.99.Little Tikes has also started up a Cozy Coupe Owners Club for its loyal drivers. Membership includes a personalised number plate, T-shirt and driver's licence. In addition to the new GB Coupe and the classic red and yellow Cozy Coupe, sales have also been strong for the pink coloured Princess Coupe, a police liveried Tikes Patrol Coupe, as well as a London Black Cab version.Leader of the pack: the award-winning Bilbos Celex LWB.

And the Bilbo Celex LWB came out on top. The Wheelhome Skurry was the runner-up in the Campervan of the Year category, while the Wellhouse Hyundai Bianco and Hillside Ellastone were selected for a special mention.Head of the judging panel and editor ofWhich Motorhome, Peter Vaughan, said: "Bilbo's has been building VW campervans for 35 years and that experience shows, both in the quality of the designs and the class-leading build. You won't find a better VW camper than this."Bilbo's has been converting campervans since 1977. Prices start at £35,000 and it offers a wide range of short or long-wheelbase VW T5 conversions with a choice of high-tops or elevating roofs. There are also four layouts to suit customers' needs and lifestyles. The Bilbo's Celex LWB is priced from £40,940. For more information, go tobilbos.com
It was fitting that a memorial service held Saturday for computer freedom activist Aaron Swartz, who killed himself on January 11 as he faced hacking charges, was open to all.In a spacious meeting room in the heart of New York's East Village neighbourhood, friends, fellow activists and supporters of 26-year-old Swartz gathered to recount fond memories mixed with angry calls for justice and a continuation of the fights that Swartz dedicated his life to.Swartz's girlfriend, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, was firm in her belief that Swartz's death had been caused by a prosecution system that had threatened him with up to 30 years in jail for hacking an online collection of academic journals linked to MIT with the intent of releasing millions of research papers on to the internet.She said the prospect of a trial had dominated their life together and that prosecutors in the case should be held accountable for a tragedy that has shocked the tech community worldwide. "He faced a deeply dysfunctional criminal justice system," she said, and blamed a recent delay as a final straw. "He was so scared, so desperate and so tormented, and more than anything else just so weary, he could not take it another day," she said.Stinebrickner-Kauffmann asked the packed crowd of several hundred inside the famed Cooper Union building's Great Hall – a scene of major civil rights and anti-slavery speeches in the past – to fight on for internet freedom and win justice for Swartz. Her anger was matched by that of Roy Singham, a close collaborator with Swartz who founded the Freedom to Connect initiative.In a fiery and emotional speech that earned a rousing standing ovation, Singham slammed the case against Swartz. "This was not suicide. It was murder by intimidation, bullying and torment," he said. "We must demand accountability for those who tormented Aaron." He cast Swartz as the latest in a long line of heroic activists trying to change a powerful and entrenched system. "He was, in my humble opinion, one of the true extraordinary revolutionaries that this country has produced," he said.The actions that brought the case against Swartz were just part of a young life spent using his undoubted computer genius in the cause of internet freedom and trying to make as much information accessible to all as possible. He helped build the Reddit online community and had been an instrumental voice in defeating legislative efforts aimed at extending control over the internet.But Swartz was also troubled by a long struggle with depressive moods. The US attorney for Massachusetts, Carmen Ortiz, who brought the case, has disputed claims that her office was too zealous. "This office's conduct was appropriate in bringing and handling this case. The career prosecutors handling this matter took on the difficult task of enforcing a law they had taken an oath to uphold, and did so reasonably," she said in a statement last week. It has also emerged that Swartz had been offered a plea bargain for a six-month sentence.But during the moving memorial service, during which numerous speakers paid tribute to their friend and a video of a speech by Swartz was played, there was also a strong focus on the happy side of Swartz's life. Amid much laughter, a picture emerged of an intensely driven young man who had a playful side that won immense loyalty from friends and activists all over the world."Aaron would have loved to have been here," Stinebrickner-Kaufmann said. His longtime friend Ben Wikler paid tribute to Swartz's personality. "What I found incredible about Aaron was not only his dedication and his brilliance, but also how much fun he was," he said.Another speaker, Holden Karnofksy, who heads the GiveWell charity industry group, remembered long walks through Brooklyn's streets with Swartz intensely debating everything from Victorian sexuality to the reliability of GDO figures.But perhaps the most poignant vignette, especially in the wake of the outpouring of global emotion among hackers and internet professionals, came from journalist Quinn Norton, who had been a close confidant of Swartz's. It seemed to symbolise the link between his private and public lives. She described a camping trip in northern California in which the two had tried and failed to light a camp fire in the face of driving rain. But, upon later returning to the pile of wood they thought their sparks had failed to ignite, they discovered it had become a roaring blaze. Fighting back the tears, she described the scene. "It was strong enough to stay lit in the rain," she said.
Last year'sNinja Gaiden 3enjoyed a mixed reception at best. With former series head Tomonobu Itagaki absent, it was perceived to have softened, been made more accessible, less demanding and, most sinfully, easier.In this enhanced Wii U version, super-ninja Ryu Hayabusa's globe-trotting battle against the Lords of Alchemy cult remains the same, but there's a distinctive spike in difficulty. Where players could formerly progress at a steady pace through button-bashing,Razor's Edgedemands far more precision, timed defences against enemy attacks and lightning-fast retaliations. Extra modes, including the online Shadows of the World, and bonus missions for female ninja Ayane (among others) add considerably more playing time to the package.However, while the content is significantly improved, the Wii U gamepad often feels ill-designed for it. Touchscreen controls for special attacks or swapping weapons complement, rather than replace, the physical button commands, and reaching over to activate them feels less intuitive than hammering out a combo. The bulkier pad also proves less than ideal for the more challenging combat, meaning some will prefer to stick with the flawed earlier release.
On 11 January, a young American geek named Aaron Swartz killed himself, and most of the world paid no attention. In the ordinary run of things, "it was not an important failure", as Auden put it inMusée des Beaux Arts.About suffering they were never wrong,The old Masters: how well they understoodIts human position: how it takes placeWhile someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully alongBut Swartz's death came like a thunderbolt in cyberspace, because this insanely talented, idealistic, complex, diminutive lad was a poster boy for everything that we value about the networked world. He was 26 when he died, but from the age of 14 he had been astonishing those of us who followed him on the internet. In 10 yearshe had accomplished morethan most people do in a lifetime.In the days following his death,the blogosphere resoundedwith expressions of grief, sadness and loss not just from people who had worked with him, but also from those who only knew him from afar – the users of the things he helped to create (the RSS web feed, social news websiteReddit, theCreative Commonscopyright licences, for example), or those who had followed his scarily open andthoughtful blogging.But in addition to the grief, there was real anger, because many people feel that Swartz had been hounded to his death by aggressive federal prosecutors. This view was most vividly expressed by his father at Aaron's funeral service in Chicago on Tuesday. "Aaron did not commit suicide," said Robert Swartz, "but was killed by the government. Someone who made the world a better place was pushed to his death by the government."What lay behind this anger was United States v Aaron Swartz, a prosecution launched in Massachusetts, charging Swartz with "wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer and recklessly damaging a protected computer". If convicted, he could have faced 35 years in prison and a $1m fine. The case stemmed from something he had done in furtherance of his belief that academic publications should be freely available. He had surreptitiously hooked up a laptop to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology network and used it to download millions of articles from the JSTOR archive of academic publications.Even those of us who shared his belief in open access thought this an unwise stunt. But what was truly astonishing – and troubling – was the vindictiveness of the prosecution, which went for Swartz as if he were a major cyber-criminal who was stealing valuable stuff for personal gain. "The outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron,"wrote Lawrence Lessig, the distinguished lawyer who was also one of Swartz's mentors. "It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor's behaviour. From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterise what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way. The 'property' Aaron had 'stolen', we were told, was worth 'millions of dollars' – with the hint, and then the suggestion, that his aim must have been to profit from his crime. But anyone who says that there is money to be made in a stash ofacademic articlesis either an idiot or a liar. It was clear what this was not, yet our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed."The phrase that came to mind when I first saw the indictment against Swartz was Alexander Pope's famous rhetorical question: "Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?" It would be possible to write off the Swartz prosecution (as some have done) as the action of a politically ambitious attorney general, but actually it fits a much more sinister pattern. It was clear that a decision had been made to make an example of this cheeky young hacker and in that sense this grotesque prosecution sits neatly alongside the treatment of Corporal Bradley Manning, not to mention the hysterical reaction of the US authorities to WikiLeaks.What has happened, in fact, is that governments which since 9/11 have presided over the morphing of their democracies into national security states have realised that the internet represents a truly radical challenge to their authority, and they are absolutely determined to control it. They don't declare this as their intention, of course, but instead talk up "grave" threats – cybercrime, piracy and (of course) child pornography – as rationales for their action. But, in the end, this is now all about control. And if a few eggheads and hackers get crushed on the way well, that's too bad. RIP Aaron.
Many app developers simply port successful titles from consoles to mobiles without any thought as to how they might be suited to the new medium. WithJoe Danger(Apple iOS, £1.99) Hello Games, however, has wisely rebuilt its award-winning title from the ground up.Taking charge of motorcycling daredevil Joe, there are 59 levels filled with tricky obstacles and challenges. Joe's bike now pushes forward automatically, leaving the player free to focus on jumping, ducking and all-important stunts – with taps, presses and swipes. Obstacles vary from the sharks in pools to muddy puddles, but they all require intense concentration to make it through the course unscathed, and even more so to earn a pro medal. For that three bonus missions have to be completed, in addition to simply surviving the level. It's an excellent example of how to revamp a console favourite.Alpha Squadron(Android, Martian Monkey, £1.85) takes a different approach. In look and gameplay, it's eerily similar to Gamecube favouriteRogue Squadron– putting you in control of a red and white X-shaped ship familiar to allStar Warsfans. It's aerial combat, now in the palm of your hand, and despite being a shameless rip-off it looks superb, with all the mission types you'd expect – but as always it's the dogfights that provide most fun.Inevitably, the touchscreen controls let it down slightly – it's much harder to steer on the screen in the midst of hectic combat than with a gamepad – but is nonetheless a sterling effort, that will appeal to anyone with fond memories of blasting Tie fighters in the late nineties.
Ostensibly a 2D pick-up-and-play scrolling platformer,Fractured Soul, in development since 2004, offers far more than might be expected. The only apparent objective is to escape a labyrinthine space station filled with baddies. Drawing comparisons with retro classics of theMega Manilk, the game blends familiar run, jump and shoot 'em up mechanics with the ability to switch between the 3DS's dual screens, where pressing the shoulder buttons offers a parallel view of gameplay. This works surprisingly well, with an alternative self invulnerable to solid structures and enemy fire, enabling you to outmanoeuvre bad guys and solve puzzles.It quickly ramps up to frantic, often excruciating, difficulty, demanding lightning fast reactions and co-ordination to track the action across two screens. New challenges are also frequently introduced, such as slippery ice or inverse gravity on the second screen.Fractured Soulhas the potential to earn its stripes as a bona fide 3DS classic. Not to be missed.
Thinking about Google over the last week, I have fallen into the typically procrastinatory habit of every so often typing the words "what is" or "what" or "wha" into the Google search box at the top right of my computer screen. Those prompts are all the omnipotent engine needs to inform me of the current instant top 10 of the virtual world's most urgent desires. At the time of typing, this list reads, in descending order:What is the fiscal cliffWhat is my ipWhat is obamacareWhat is loveWhat is glutenWhat is instagramWhat does yolo meanWhat is the illuminatiWhat is a good credit scoreWhat is lupusIt is a list that indicates anxieties, not least the ways in which we are restlessly fixated with our money, our bodies and our technology – and paranoid and confused in just about equal measure. A Prince Charles-like desire for the definition of love, in my&nbsp;repetitive experience of the last few&nbsp;days, always seems to come in at No 4 on this list of priorities, though the preoccupations above it and below it tend to shift slightly with the news.The list also supports another truism: that we – the billion components of the collective questioning mind – have got used to asking Google pretty much anything and expecting it to point us to some kind of satisfactory answer. It's long since become the place most of us go for knowledge, possibly even, desperately, for wisdom. And it is already almost inconceivable to imagine how we might have gone about finding the answer to some of these questions only 15 years ago without it – a visit to the library? To a doctor? To Citizens Advice? To a shrink?That was the time, in the prehistory of about 1995, when our ideas of "search" still carried the sense of the word's Latin roots – a search was a kind of "arduous quest" that invariably involved "wandering" and "seeking" and "traversing". Not any longer. For those who are growing up to search in this millennium, it implies nothing more taxing than typing two words into a box – or, increasingly, mumbling them into a phone – and waiting less than an instant for a comprehensive answer, generally involving texts and images and films and books and maps. Search's sense of questing purpose has already gone the way of other pre-Google concepts, such as "getting lost".That rate of change – of how we gather information, how we make connections and think – has been so rapid that it invites a further urgent Google question. Where will search go next? One answer to that question was provided by the billionaire double act of Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google's founders, in 2004, when pressed about their vision of the future by the formerNewsweekjournalist Steven Levy."Search will be included in people's brains," said Page of their ambition. "When you think about something and don't really know much about it, you will automatically get information.""That's true," Brin concurred. "Ultimately I view Google as a way to augment your brain with the knowledge of the world. Right now, you go into your computer and type a phrase, but you can imagine that it could be easier in the future, that you can have just devices you talk into or you can have computers that pay attention to what's going on around them…"Page, generally the wilder thinker, was adamant, though. "Eventually, you'll have the implant, where if you think about a fact, it will just tell you the answer."Nine years on, Brin's vision at least is already reality. In the past couple of years, a great advance in voice-recognition technology has allowed you to talk to search apps – notably oniPhone's Sirias well asGoogle's Jelly Bean– whileGoogle Now, awarded2012 innovation of the year,  will tell you what you want to know – traffic conditions, your team's football scores, the weather – before you ask it, based on your location and search history. Page's brain implants remain some way further off, though both Google founders have lately been wearing "Google Glass" prototypes, headbands that project a permanent screen on the edge of your field of vision, with apps – cameras, search, whatever – answerable to voice-activated command. Searching is ever more intimately related to thinking.Outside Google HQ in Mountain View, California. Photograph: Donald Weber for the ObserverIn this sense, the man who is, these days, in charge of the vast majority of the world's questing and wandering and seeking and traversing is called Amit Singhal. Aged 44, head of Google Search, he is a boyishly enthusiastic presence, who inhabits a much-mythologised office in Mountain View, California, somewhat in the way that the Wizard of Oz lived at one end of the Yellow Brick Road. Singhal is the man who pulls the levers that might just help you find a heart, or a brain, or the way back to Kansas. For a dozen years, he has taken over responsibility from Brin for writing and refining the closely guarded algorithm – more than 200 separate coded equations – that powers Google's endless trawl for answers through pretty much all of history's recorded knowledge. So far, he has never stopped finding ways to make it ever smarter and quicker.To find Singhal, I go through all those by now second-nature travel preparations. I Google a hotel to stay at nearby in Palo Alto, view the options, have a virtual look around a couple before booking. I Google my flight times and check in. I Google a car hire firm, find the cheapest on a comparison site, and choose a car, and hook up to Google maps to plan the route of the 400 or so miles I'll drive from Los Angeles northwards. I Google information about where to park at the Googleplex, and Google theStreet Viewof the walk I will make from the car to the right office building, past the replicaT rexoutside. I Google a few interviews Singhal has given in the past. And then a day or two later I do it all for real.There is something slightly disconcerting about the Mountain View Googleplex itself, which I guess has a lot to do with finding yourself in the physical space of so virtual an entity. At the end of last year, Google published photographs of its vast and ever-growing data centres for the first time. The images of our cloud of knowing were either inspiring or terrifying, depending on your point of view. Endless banks of servers, linked with primary coloured Google wiring, stretched as far as the eye could imagine, a great outsourced brain thrumming in high-security hangars in Oklahoma, Ohio and Georgia, fed by all the world's anxiety and curiosity. The control centre of that unprecedented storage centre could hardly be more open access, however.You can wander around the sprawling  landscaped Googleplex campus or hop on a primary coloured Google bike to cycle between buildings and nobody bothers you at all. The Googleplex was conceived by Brin and Page to encourage geeks to be sociable. It seems to work; it is overpopulated by a chatting and mingling crowd of what seem like quite intense postgrad students who look happy and healthy and are, though you would never quite guess it, often jaw-droppingly rich. The site is full of free cafes, punctuated by volleyball courts; every workspace has pool and table tennis tables; you can visit a doctor or a dentist, get a haircut, get your dry cleaning done, have a massage (Google's masseuse became a stock millionaire), go to the gym.It has book talks, movies and music events – when I visit David Beckham had just been on site as a "guest speaker". There are whiteboard walls everywhere full of algebra and in-jokes; there is a learning space with classes in everything from mindfulness to Greek myth. And of course lots of gadgets. In the foyer is a mini wraparoundImaxof screens that allows you to key in a postcode and stand in any street in the world. Fittingly, having Googled the way here, now I have arrived I find myself standing outside my house in London again, exactly where I was two days and a transatlantic flight earlier.Amit Singhal: 'The fascination with flying though galaxies and talking to a computer that could answer any question was always there for me.’ Photograph: Donald Weber for the ObserverGoogle's Mr Search, Amit Singhal, has likewise come a long way to get here. He started out in a village in Uttar Pradesh in India, in a home that for the first eight years of his life possessed no screen at all. When one arrived in 1977, a black-and-white television, it carried for Singhal, he tells me, all the magic of prophecy. "There were two kinds of programmes," he recalls. "Programming for local farmers and reruns of American series such asStar Trek." You don't really have to think too hard to imagine which of these programmes Singhal chose."I watched way too muchStar Trek, to the extent that I could remember episodes by heart," he recalls with a laugh, "and I deeply believe now that shaped my thinking. The fascination with flying through galaxies and talking to a computer that could answer any question was always there for me. But of course I never imagined those problems would begin to be solved in my lifetime at all."Singhal found himself in any case in the right place at the right time. He started studying the idea of search as a graduate in America in 1991, the year the world wide web began making its connections. He did a PhD and then ended up in the Bell laboratories at AT&amp;T. It was only when he came to Google in the millennium year, however, that he experienced "a strange kind of discontinuity". Everything that had seemed like science fiction all his life was suddenly within his compass.To prove that point, Singhal takes his Android smartphone out of his pocket and, like Captain Kirk, talks into it. "Google: what is the population of London?" he says. "The population of London was 8.174 million in 2011," the carefully conversational voice replies. "How tall is Justin Bieber?" he&nbsp;wonders. "Justin Bieber is 5ft 7in tall." Singhal looks at me with childlike glee. "If I had gone to sleep 20 years ago and you had woken me up today and I heard that, I would be thinking, yes! And where do I sign up to fly to another galaxy?"What he is demonstrating, however, he insists, is still just the beginning. Google search is, he says, with evangelical zeal, on the threshold of another epochal change in its fast-forward evolution. Having searched for a decade or so using the original brilliant principle of hierarchies of web-based links, the great primary coloured knowledge domination machine has, Singhal suggests, "begun to learn how to understand the real world of people, places and things".To answer his question about Justin Bieber, Google already has to know quite a lot. It has to know Justin Bieber is a person and that tallness means height. "So you have already got to get to the semantics of what is being asked. But even that is not enough. Because beyond that there is this huge mass of unstructured text that we know as the web. And you cannot properly understand what was asked for without really understanding how you are going to go about answering it."Until now, Google has been an unprecedented signposter of knowledge. It has not "known" the answer to anything itself but it has had an awfully clever way of directing you to exactly the place you can find out. In some senses, that attribute is in the process of changing. This year, Google will roll out what it calls itsKnowledge Graph, the closest any system has yet come to creating what Tim Berners-Lee, originator of the web itself, called "the semantic web", the version that had understanding as well as data, that could itself provide answers, not links to answers.Inside Google HQ. Photograph: Donald Weber for the ObserverThe Knowledge Graph is a database of the 500 million most searched for people, places and things in the Google world. For each one of these things, it has established a deep associative context that makes it more than a string of words or a piece of data. Thus, when you type "10 Downing Street" into Google with Knowledge Graph, it responds to that phrase not as&nbsp;any old address but much in the way&nbsp;you or I might respond – with a string of real-world associations, prioritised in order of most frequently asked questions.Five years ago, whenJohn Battellewrote his bookThe Search, which is still the definitive history of the subject, he concluded by imagining a future directly out of Isaac Asimov's science fiction. "All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected. But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships. A timeless interval was spent doing that."Knowledge Graph, you might say, is the beginning of that "timeless interval". Google has already come closer than anyone could ever have imagined to the "nothing was left to be collected" part of that equation. It is in searchable possession not only of the trillions of pages of the world wide web, but it is well on the way to photographing all the world's streets, of scanning all the world's books, of collecting every video uploaded to the public internet, mostly on its ownYouTube. In recent years, it has been assiduously accumulating as much human voice recording as possible, in all the languages and dialects under the sun, in order to power its translation and voice recognition projects. It is doing the same for face recognition in films and photographs. Not to mention the barely used possibilities of the great mass of information Google possesses regarding the interests and communications and movements and search history of just about everyone with a phone or an internet connection.This data has been collected not just for the purpose of feeding it back to us as accurately as possible, but also for the wider purpose: of teaching Google how to think for itself. Singhal has worked with what he calls "signals of salience" for the past dozen years, finding ever more accurate text- and link-based methods of making searches happen. But also, crucially, as these signals have become ever more sophisticated, Singhal and his team have been able to "observe the whole world interacting with the data, and with that we were able to begin to do something else, which was to begin to make the computer understand the context of what was being asked".Outside Google HQ. Photograph: Donald Weber for the ObserverThe way in which this is done is quite simple. Search analysis is divided into "long clicks" and "short clicks". A long click represents a satisfied customer. A user performs a search, clicks through on a result and remains on that site for a long time. They don't come back to the result set immediately to click on another result or to refine their query. A short click is the opposite of a long click. It occurs when a user performs a search, clicks through on a result and quickly comes back to the result set to click on an alternative result. It represents a minor failure. We may think we are learning all the time from Google, but by virtue of this ongoing trillion-click analysis, it is learning far more from us.In this way, as far back as 2002, Singhal introduced a refinement based on Ludwig Wittgenstein's theory on how the meaning of words is always influenced by context. Searches for ambiguous terms began to look beyond the search terms for other related words. So a phrase such as "hot dog" would be understood in relation to mustard and baseball games, not overheated canines. "Nuance," he says now, "is what makes us human."I imagine, I say, that along the way he has been assisted in this work by the human component. Presumably we have got more precise in our search terms the more we have used Google?He sighs, somewhat wearily. "Actually," he says, "it works the other way. The more accurate the machine gets, the lazier the questions become. So actually our lives get harder." He had to work especially hard to correct and understand spelling errors and analyse synonyms. And all along the dream has been the oldStar Trekone of providing the right answer to what you think you want to know even if you don't know quite how to phrase the question. To work like a mind works, in other words. "The end game of this is we want to make it as natural as possible a thought process," he says. "We are maniacally focusing on the user to reduce every possible friction point between them, their thoughts and the information they want to find." Getting ever closer to Page's brain implants, in effect.Knowledge Graph is the first real demonstration of that prowess. It started a couple of years ago when, Singhal says, "We ran into this tiny company calledMetaweb, which had, through a symphony of machines and humans, begun to perfect a system to present real-world people, places and things in a computer memory. The method seemed scalable. So we bought this company."By that point, Metawab had stored 12 million reference points. Over the last two years, in its characteristic style, Google has quickly accelerated that to "over 570 million references with 18 billion factual connections between them". (This is a&nbsp;sizable number: by point of comparison, the English version of Wikipedia has about 4 million pages.) Google is in the process of launching Knowledge Graph in seven languages and aiming to exhibit the same local intelligence in each.Knowledge Graph's project manager is Emily Moxley. She talks me though some of this intelligence. It goes quite a long way beyond being able to distinguish between an English query for football scores and an American one. "In Japan for example," she says, "our analysis shows that people want to know quite a lot about the blood type of film stars", so that will be a prioritised part of the instant Knowledge Graph in that part of the world.Likewise, Japanese Googlers seemed short-click frustrated that the search for sumo wrestling data was not as accurate as it might be. "We worked on rectifying that," Moxley says. "We thought at the very least we should be able to answer a certain depth of queries." What kind of depth? "Somewhere at least in the most popular tens of millions," she suggests.More than that, Singhal wants to be sure all aspects of the data are properly in harmony with your desires. "If you wanted to find out about Dr Martin Luther King's 'I have a dream speech'," he says, "you might want the text, you might want a picture of him, but we guess that what you really want is a video clip of him delivering the speech – so how to get that to the top of&nbsp;your search." Again Knowledge Graph can deliver that; it starts to know what you want to know.In talking to Singhal, it is quite easy to get caught up in the utopian possibilities of the technology and quite easy, of course, to forget that Google has also created wealth faster and more efficiently than any company in history; that it is probably the most effective generator of advertising dollars ever invented; and that a great deal of what it knows about us we might well want it not to (an unease that might grow by association now that Facebook hasannounced a search engineof its own data, one that promises to be even more intimate in its revelation of personal history than Google has ever dared to be).Inside Google HQ. Photograph: Donald Weber for the ObserverAll the Google employees I speak to adopt the same kind of reflexive flinch if you hint at any of this, if you suggest that their motives for all this data gathering, this knowledge sharing, might be anything other than pure. It is the same kind of "Why wouldn't you trust us?" flinch that has powered the company's growth through loyalty and that sees it refuse to reveal its own intimate search history even when threatened, as it is currently by the European Union, to prove that it does not artificially weight algorithmic results in favour of its own products and commercial partners.Singhal rejects all of this. He winces when I ask: "What's in it for Google?""We are a search people," he says. "The thing that motivates me is to build a search engine that will outdo all my previous creations. Simple as that."Further, he believes, as a statement of faith, "that all information is empowering". One of his favourite examples comes from his own family. Every year, Singhal returns to Uttar Pradesh and sees the transformations that the mobile availability of all the world's knowledge has brought. And most years his father comes over to California. "My dad is a retired civil servant," Singhal says, "and when he visited us he used to worry the whole time about returning home and taking presents through customs where the rules about what you could bring home were very complicated, and changing all the time, and he would get harassed and asked a hundred questions."I remember 10 years ago when he was here I showed him how to Google 'Indian custom regulations' and there it all was in black and white, up to the&nbsp;minute. He printed it out and his chest all puffed out. As soon as he got home he called me excitedly to say how he had presented the customs officer with&nbsp;this bit of paper and told him how&nbsp;his gifts for his grandkids complied with the letter of it. To which&nbsp;the customs officer replied, 'Welcome home, Mr Singhal!'"Singhal could no doubt point to a multitude of such examples. But what&nbsp;about the less measurable ways that the ease of search has changed our lives? I ask. What about the ways in which it has diminished the excitement of serendipity, the way that&nbsp;it has made the personal experience of a chance encounter with&nbsp;knowledge so much rarer?Singhal has been working on that. The Knowledge Graph will still return the results it thinks you most likely need, but down the list it will have a randomised element; it will have chance built into it, another way it might mimic the way we think. His current obsession is in behavioural psychology; he has become an avid student of the work of Daniel Kahneman. "I just love the way it details how human beings feel when faced with choices and decisions, what makes you run away when someone offers you 32 chocolates to choose from, but which satisfies you when they only give you one chocolate."How, I wonder, will Google incorporate that knowledge in its unending search?"I don't know exactly yet…" Singhal says brightly, leaving you in no doubt of what might be his organisation's guiding mantra: he will soon.LOOK THE OTHER WAY Other search engines are availableDuckDuckGoSearches the web without filtering results based on previous searches. Google will customise results based on a person's search history, which can give you biased search results (called the "filter bubble"). Not only does DuckDuckGo burst the filter bubble to give you more results, but it won't remember your previous searches.Good for:Unbiased searches, maintaining privacy, finding illicit content.Wolfram AlphaNot a search engine but a "computational knowledge engine", Wolfram Alpha can interpret queries and provide concrete factual answers rather than a list of search results.

For example, "Italian restaurants in London my friends like", or "Friends of friends who are single and live in Ipswich" would yield specific, personal results. Graph Search will be integrated with search engine Bing (much like Google) to provide answers outside the realm of Facebook.Good for:Narrowing down photo searches or holiday recommendations, online dating.StartpageSearches Google for you by proxy so you&nbsp;can still use the powerful search engine but results aren't skewed by your&nbsp;search history and your searches will not be tracked.Good For:Finding results without being spied on.Julia Chapman
What can we expect at the ninthDLDin Munich this weekend? Every tech conference now has the inevitable blokes (and it usually is blokes) flogging their books, blokes perpetuating hype about some possibly-soon-to-IPO consumer web business and blokes pitching their impossibly niche and on-trend startup. See also: never-ending panel discussion on the economics of social media, the groundbreaking digital marketing campaign of our times or whether paywalls are a good idea. Change the MP3, will you?Photo byDavid SifryonFlickr.Some rights reserved.DLD, or Digital Life Design, gathers a higher calibre of speakers (partly because it runs just before the World Economic Forum in nearby Davos) but also an invite-only audience of around 800 people from Europe, the US and beyond (imagine that!). Though there is a fairly detailed schedule, the organisers like to regularly remind conference groms (as surfers would say) that the aim is spontaneity; that might meanEsther Dysonpopping up at breakfast,Alec Rosslingering around the bagels at lunch orPeter Thielhovering by the bar at bedtime.But beyond the names is the nature of the conversation, and DLD does like to throw its net a little wider. Discussions are beyond individual companies and more concerned with concepts, with new thinking and approaches, and with connected thinking across projects from bionics and biosynthetic architecture to climate prediction, big data, 3D printing and crowdsourced cultural authority.DLD has tried to counter criticism of the male-dominated event by introducing theAenne Burda award, which this year architectZaha Hadidwill collect, as well as a separate summer conference calledDLD Women. Despite that, the DLD programme is still overwhelmingly male; either the conference organisers have struggled to find high-impact female speakers in business, science, technology and the arts, or men have a monopoly on building and identifying the patterns that connect to create the future. I sincerely hope it is not the latter.
In some ways, the flasher the car, the slower it is. No,&nbsp;seriously. Say I've got some top-of-the-range German luxobarge to review. I get in, by pointing&nbsp;and pressing – that bit's usually straightforward. But then I've got to&nbsp;start the bloody thing. Is&nbsp;it a&nbsp;question of putting the key in&nbsp;a hole and turning? Almost certainly not. A while back, someone decided that aspirational people shouldn't have to do this; they want to put down the key thing somewhere they'll later forget, and press a&nbsp;starter button instead. Where is it, though, and do I have to put my foot on the clutch (if there is one) or the brake before it will start?Next I&nbsp;have to wait for the car's various systems to wake up, and figure out how to adjust the seat and the mirrors. Right, handbrake off… Oh,&nbsp;there isn't one – it's got an electronic parking brake. Is that way on, or off? God, I hate electronic parking brakes…Nightmare. I think my record – zero to some mph – is about 10 minutes. By which time my girlfriend had given up and walked to the tube, and there was a group of children pointing and laughing at&nbsp;me. Imagine if it was a getaway car – how embarrassing. And how nicked would I be?This Punto is a much better getaway car. It can be driven without looking. This is motoring at its most basic. Everything is exactly where I expect it to be. I can be starting with my right hand, releasing the handbrake with the left, clutch, revs, first, without thinking. We're off, away in record time.So three doors isn't ideal for getting my accomplices in. But so what? It's the perfect excuse. Screw them – I'll leave them. All the more loot – which I'll sling on the front seat – for me.OK, the 1.3-litre multijet 85hp diesel engine isn't exactly going to set anyone's world alight. That's fine though: I'm in town, I want to be small and nippy, which this is. Unnoticed, too, for which the Punto's rather ordinary, dated exterior will help.And the good thing about this engine, which is new, is that it emits less than the magic 100g/km of CO2(as well as doing 80 miles to the gallon – 80!). If I'm in London, I'm not going to get caught out not paying the congestion charge. I probably won't have to fill up, either. Also, I&nbsp;care. I may be a bank robber, but I&nbsp;don't want to steal the planet from my children and grandchildren… Yeah, all right, and I don't want to pay any road tax, either.And because I've got away with the swag – all of it – and I'm safely living in Paraguay, I can now go and get myself a car I actually like.

Dust 514(PS3), the upcoming first-person-shooter-meets-massively-multiplayer-online-game, will open its beta test to the public on Tuesday. What makes this announcement impressive is that developer CCP Games says it has also managed to integrate the game withEVE Online, the vastly popular PC-based online game, in which players can acquire catastrophically vast and powerful fleets of spaceships. It's rare that console and PC users are able to wander round the same game space, let alone when one group of players is on foot carrying guns, while the other plies the galaxy in enormous, savagely powerful star ships …Games out this week includeCall Of Duty: Black Ops 2 Nuketown Zombies(PS3, PC), the irradiated undead-heavy slab of downloadable content already available for Xbox, andSiNG Party(Wii U), a distinctly feature-light karaoke sing 'em-up.
Reading this on mobile? Click here to viewPixel Defenders Puzzle is a match-three game with several extra dimensions to its complex ruleset. In it, you place three pixels next to each other to make a basic warrior, three warriors make a tougher warrior, and three of those make a super-warrior. Depending on pixel colour, you can create barbarians, wizards and rangers, so you need to be careful to group them so that they can easily be upgraded. Each turn earns action points, which you spend attacking the enemy, whose sole job is to kill your VIP, a piece that continually moves around the board and can't attack. Some units temporarily power-up friends or hobble foes, and all eventually turn into a rock or tree stump when their action points have been spent. The result is a series of interwoven systems that take considerable concentration to manage effectively, especially when the enemies get more devious as levels progress, with magical foes that attack more frequently and vanish at will. Presented in mock 8-bit style with "chip tune" music that gets a bit full-on after a while, it's a mentally testing puzzle game that has nothing whatsoever to do with dexterity.
Reading this on mobile? Click here to viewStreets Of Rage was an early-90s game in which you strolled through city streets laying waste to a steady flow of assailants via button mashing. Ninja Gaiden is its spiritual successor, and while the urban scenery and multiple attackers remain, it demands a bit more rigour than simply stabbing buttons; slipping out of the way of incoming bullets, knives and guided missiles is an indispensable part of your armoury. You can chop off enemies' limbs, sousing the screen in even more claret than before, and there are new upgradeable weapons and abilities as well as a section where you play as Ayane from the Dead Or Alive series. Other than that, it's business as usual, which means super-fast combat accompanied by your ninja's Tourette's-like stream of staccato profanity, absolutely terrible Japanese rock music, and a brutally hard difficulty level that marks a return to the franchise's cliff-like learning curve. Gruelling and repetitive it may be, but for the right kind of masochist, there is magic to be eked out.
In massive, swaggering capital letters, "Mega" stretches across the grassy slope in front of Dotcom Mansion. A huddle of electricians and carpenters are removing the wooden stencils and wiring in the fluorescent tubes. They are up to G. All around the vast grounds of Kim Dotcom's luxury home just north of Auckland, New Zealand, gardeners and technicians are busy, like Oompa-Loompas at the Chocolate Factory, setting up for the big night, overlooked by life-size inflatable giraffes and hippos.On Sunday, almost a year after the internet entrepreneur and several of his associates were arrested in a spectacular dawn raid on the mansion, about 200 invited guests will gather at the opulent estate for the launch of Mega. The new cyberlocker service is a simplified, super-encrypted successor to Megaupload, the file-sharing site that once reputedly accounted for 4% of all internet traffic, and which US prosecutors had taken offline moments before the helicopters descended in New Zealand a year ago.After spending almost a month in prison in early 2012, Dotcom and his co-accused were awarded bail – the first of a series of court victories that have left the prosecution case looking increasingly wobbly. With any hearing for extradition to the US to face criminal copyright charges having been pushed back, it is hard not to see the extravagant unveiling of the new site as a two-finger gesture aimed at US authorities."I don't see it like that,"says Dotcom, sitting at the head of a 20-metre-long tableout the back of the house, flanked by two of his lawyers and his co-accused colleague Finn Batao – all glued to iPads and laptops. The German-born tycoon is clearly more than willing to be cast as the courageous leader of a crusade against the dinosaurs of Hollywood and the politicians who enable their obsolete ways of doing business."We want to show the world that we are innovators. We want to show the world that cloud storage has a right to exist. And, of course, when you launch something like this, you can expect some controversy. The content industry is going to react really emotionally about this. The US government will probably try and destroy the new business … you've got to stand up against that, and fight that, and I'm doing that … I will not allow them to chill me."The series of setbacks to the prosecution case has prompted speculation that the extradition hearing itself may never be heard – a scenario that Dotcom, who turns 39 next week, says he would regret. "We want to expose what has happened here. We have a lot of information that shows the political interference. We feel that what happened here was manufactured to destroy Megaupload, and we want to show that."The case against Dotcom and his allies rests on proving that they were profiting, knowingly and willingly, from the illegal sharing of copyright-protected material – in effect, that the exchange of pirated goods was part of the Megaupload business model. "That's complete bullshit. Excuse my language, but that's just crap," says Dotcom."Megaupload was created initially as a service that allows you to send large files because email attachments had limitations … and that's still the case today. The popularity and initial growth was all around that. This was never set up with the intent to be some kind of piracy haven. If the US government says that we are a mega-conspiracy, a mafia that has created this kind of thing to be a criminal network of pirates, they're completely wrong … for them it was about shutting it down and dealing with it later on the fly. They are hacking the legal system."And Dotcom knows a hacker. During what he has called his "young and stupid" years in Germany he was convicted for computer hacking, and later took a plea deal and a probation sentence over insider trading charges, though he maintains he was "actually saving a company and over 120 jobs". The conviction was subsequently wiped from his record under German clean-slate legislation.Back then, Dotcom "thought of myself as more American than Americans", he says. "I always had this attitude of can-do, and if you're successful you can show it, which is a very un-German thing, you know. And now, in hindsight, looking at this, the US has lost a lot of its flair for me. It's becoming such an aggressive state."After a year in which the Megaupload dispute has become one of the most prominent and colourful talking points in the debate over "internet freedom", Dotcom himself has, he says, had his eyes opened. "When you live in your happy bubble and you have everything you desire and you live a great life, you don't think about all the nasty shit that is happening. I have a much better understanding now of how the US government operates and how much spying is actually going on, how much privacy intrusion is the reality today … we are very close to George Orwell's vision becoming a reality."In Dotcom's telling of the story, his travails began when the Motion Picture Association of America hired the veteran former senator Chris Dodd, who used his sway over his longtime ally the vice-president, Joe Biden, to encourage a move on Megaupload. "If you connect all the dots, and you see who the operators are behind all of this, you understand the political scope," he says."They had a political agenda, plus they had an upcoming election, and they needed an alternative for Sopa," says Dotcom, in a reference to the ill-fated and draconian Stop Online Piracy Act."It would probably have looked very bleak for [Obama] to go to Hollywood and ask them to help him get re-elected when he couldn't make Sopa happen for them. So Megaupload became a plan B."Meanwhile, says Dotcom, an aggressive and outdated approach in Hollywood blinkers them from the potential to build a new business model around the internet. "There's so much money to be made, and those fools don't get it. They just don't get it."While reluctant to talk in detail about the case of Aaron Swartz, the Reddit co-founder who killed himself last week after what some have claimed was disproportionate behaviour by prosecutors over a hacking case, there are "similarities in the way we have been prosecuted", says Dotcom. "Over-reaching abuse of power, no due process, just completely insane."And he sees a similar pattern in the treatment of WikiLeaks. "I think Julian Assange's fear, that the Swedish government is co-operating with the US government and that there might be an attempt to extradite him from Sweden, is very real. So I sympathise with him. I see also similarities and abuses that are happening in the case against WikiLeaks that were happening to us."The technologist formerly known as Kim Schmitz – and Kimble, and Kim Tim Jim Vestor, and His Royal Highness King Kimble the First – has attained a strange cult hero status in his adopted home, New Zealand. He arrived in 2009 after six years in Hong Kong, to provide his family – he and his wife Mona have five children – with a greener environment than that offered by the "concrete jungle".The saga has also turned into a domestic political sinkhole. A rightwing government-supporting MP has seen his political career compromised, probably fatally, by revelations of undisclosed donations from Dotcom to an earlier mayoral campaign. Later, and more gravely, the prime minister was forced to apologise after accepting Dotcom had been illegally spied on.With the Americans on the "warpath", says Dotcom, there seems little chance of the dispute ending amicably. But, he insists, swatting a fly away from his forehead, he remains open to talks."I'm not evil, you know? I'm a good guy. Everyone who knows me likes me … they should really come to the table, come to their senses and work this out. Because I'm not going to cave in. I'm going to fight this thing. And there's no way in hell that they have any chance to win this. I don't see it. I don't see it because I know I'm innocent, and the lawyers know I'm innocent, and we have right on our side."
Having seen his Megaupload file-storage site closed, the internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom has been arrested and released, seen his Auckland mansion raided, and may yet face extradition to the US. But, defiant, as ever, he is back with asuccessor to Megaupload. Here he is in his own words.On the raid, one year onThere isn't a day that you don't think about it. Because you walk around the house, and all of our funds were frozen so we weren't able to fix most of the damage, so I still see sledgehammer marks on all the doors, footprints on the walls, holes in the walls. Wherever they caused damage – that scarring is still there. That's one reminder. And of course the other one is whenever there's some kind of noise, or it's getting loud, you'll rush out of bed and subconsciously you are always worried – here they are again. It's something that stays with you for some time and I think it will still take some time to overcome that.On the extradition hearingWe want to have [one]. We want to expose what has happened here. We have a lot of information that shows the political interference. We feel that what happened here was manufactured to destroy Megaupload, and we want to show that.The only way I see myself settling is with full reinstatement of Mega[upload] and substantial payment for damages. And that's not going to happen. So we will have an extradition hearing.On court orders that prosecutors provide evidenceWhat they are alleging is that we were a "mega-conspiracy", that we had intent to set up some kind of criminal network that is comparable to a mafia organisation. And that is basically what the whole extradition argument revolves around. And the court has said: "We want to see some evidence in that regard. Show us what you have that confirms this …" If they had such a strong case, and they can prove there is a mega-conspiracy, then why not hand it over?On how Mega differs from MegauploadThere are quite a few innovations that Megaupload didn't have. For example, we have built in upload-download acceleration in the browser, which is technology that only became available nine months ago. We have on-the-fly encryption to protect our users' privacy – because of my own experience having been spied on, and also throughout the proceedings, the US government looking into the files of users, without a warrant …I think privacy is a very important topic, and more important today for users than ever, because you read about all these privacy violations, and reaching out from companies like Facebook and Instagram, and expanding their rights on what should be yours. We want to create a service that gives you fully automated, real-time, one-click, on-the-fly privacy. You don't even have to think about it, it just happens.On user concerns that Mega might suffer the same fate as MegauploadI agree that there will be a certain degree of anxiety around that, and I can fully appreciate and understand that. I would say that with time, when people see what the site is capable of, when they understand the technology, they read the reviews, and people like it, they're going to try it, and hopefully over time feel comfortable using it for their personal data.The good thing here is that you can now be sure when you upload your files into the cloud that only you hold the keys – not the service provider, not anyone else outside the service provider, only you personally hold the keys. And what you do with that is your responsibility.On how he has changed over the past yearI think what changed the most is my understanding of what is really going on in the world today. When you live in your happy bubble and you have everything you desire and you live a great life, you don't think about all the nasty shit that is happening. I have a much better understanding now of how the US government operates and how much spying is actually going on, how much privacy intrusion is the reality today. And from that knowledge, I said, I want to do something about that, I don't want to accept that. I think nobody should accept that.The kind of invasions in our life that we are seeing as normal today shouldn't happen – we are very close to George Orwell's vision becoming a reality.I see myself in a role now of someone who has been put in this impossible situation, and I'm not only fighting just for myself but for the rights of everybody.I think they were very naive to go into this but I also think they didn't really care much. They just wanted to shut us down. We had all these artists supporting us, we had a very popular site. They knew it was 4% of the internet, they knew we had millions of users. And it didn't stop them, you see?It was a very politically motivated move, because the MPAA [Motion Picture Association of America], which is behind all of this, has hired Chris Dodd, who is a former senator of I think 30 years, and is a very close friend of the vice-president – actually Joe Biden called him his "best friend in life". Suddenly you take a power player in the political arena, put him on to a copyright fighting agenda, of course that guy is going to call up all his buddies and say, hey, favours, 30 years, now's the time for me to call them in. And we know for a fact that Joe Biden had a very active role in this whole thing. The prosecutor in the US that is managing our case, Neal MacBride, was a former employee of Joe Biden. Over 20 years ago he helped Joe Biden with his campaign in his effort to become president, and later he was his personal counsel. Joe Biden put him into the DOJ [department of justice]. So if you connect all the dots, and you see who the operators are behind all of this, you understand the political scope.They had a political agenda, plus they had an upcoming election, and they needed an alternative for Sopa [the ill-fated Stop Online Piracy Act]. Obama was in Hollywood February, March, April to raise money from his Hollywood supporters for his re-election campaign, and what would he have to show if Sopa failed? It would probably have looked very bleak for him to go to Hollywood and ask them to help him get re-elected when he couldn't make Sopa happen for them. So Megaupload became a plan B."On Aaron SwartzI don't want to go into that too much, out of respect for Aaron. All I can say is that I see similarities in the way we have been prosecuted. Over-reaching abuse of power, no due process, just completely insane.On Julian AssangeIt would have been the easiest thing for the Swedish prosecutor to do an interview over a video link. You don't have to extradite someone to be in Sweden to be interviewed. If you have questions to make up your mind [whether] you want to bring a criminal case against Julian Assange, why not do it over a video link? It's a reasonable thing. So you have to wonder, why are they not doing that? What is their reasoning behind that?I think Julian Assange's fear, that the Swedish government is co-operating with the US government and that there might be an attempt to extradite him from Sweden, is very real. So I sympathise with him. I see also similarities and abuses that are happening in the case against WikiLeaks that were happening to us.On surveillance cultureIn the UN charter, article 12, it says every human being has the right to privacy. And how is that being respected these days by governments around the world? In the US, they are basically monitoring every bit of communication. Not just individually, with a warrant. They just copy everything. They're spending billions on data centres, they're one of the biggest purchasers of hard drives, and you wonder what do they need all that storage for? I know what they need it for. Because they continuously capture everything. In the UK, you have a government that installs cameras every 10 metres. They need a reality check … There has to be a balance here, and we're trying to re-establish that, and give the power back to the people.On copyrightI think copyright has a right to exist. If you create something, you don't want someone else to go and profit from it, you have your right to make a living and everything. So I respect copyright. What I don't respect is copyright extremism. And I what I don't respect is a business model that encourages piracy. Hollywood has a business model where they release their product at different times in different markets. In the age of the internet you can't do that.On HollywoodIf Hollywood would find a way – and I would instantly know several ways – how to solve its business model and create something that is available to everyone online at the same time and have a really nice offering, they could beat companies like Google in terms of market cap – I mean these guys have what everyone wants. They have the content that everyone wants. Google has no content. Google is making $40bn profit a year – I think – based on advertising by linking to stuff. They don't create the stuff that they're linking to. Now imagine if you would create something that has all the content in there. You could make 10 times more money than Google does because you have the rights to that stuff. You could create a very valuable internet business. Hollywood has totally missed the internet opportunity, and it's now other players that are doing that for them … There's so much money to be made, and those fools don't get it. They just don't get it.The Hollywood industry is more hated than ever now. That can't be good for business. There are people now out there who out of principle wouldn't go into a cinema or buy any product from them, simply because they are interfering with everybody's rights. And they are doing it in a malicious fashion, with corrupt methods – paying politicians and using their political influence. It's just wrong.On AmericaI always thought of myself as more American than Americans when I was living in Germany, because I always had this attitude of can-do, and if you're successful you can show it, which is a very un-German thing, you know. And now, in hindsight, looking at this, the US has lost a lot of its flair for me. It's becoming such an aggressive state, that is really harming people's rights, and I just want to do everything I can to fight that.On the endgameI'm not evil, you know? I'm a good guy. Everyone who knows me likes me … They should really come to the table, come to their senses and work this out. Because I'm not going to cave in. I'm going to fight this thing. And there's no way in hell that they have any chance to win this. I don't see it. I don't see it because I know I'm innocent, and the lawyers know I'm innocent, and we have right on our side.Asked to name his internet heroesSergey Brin and Larry Page, founders of Google:they have changed the landscape of the internet like no other. Their whole philosophy of making information available to everyone, and the power that Google has become in providing knowledge to people, I would say is the most important achievement of society in this whole internet age.Mathias Ortmann, chief technical officer, Megaupload:a true genius, a brilliant developer, and he had to go through hell in this whole indictment against us … With all of this pressure on him he managed to create a really outstanding solution that I'm really proud about – he is definitely one of my heroes.Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia founder:it's things like Wikipedia that help us to advance as a society, and help us to accelerate our evolution. If you're a researcher and you need some answer to something, and in today's world you can find it this quickly, it allows you to develop whatever you are doing much faster.
A year after Kim Dotcom's arrest and the taking down of his Megaupload file-storage site, the internet entrepreneur is preparing to unveil a successor cyber-locker site, and has renewed his attack on US prosecutors.In an interview with the Guardiandays before the launch of the stepchild of Megaupload, to be called Mega and marked with a defiantly lavish launch at the same Auckland mansion that was dramatically raided on 20 January last year, Dotcom said  the targeting of his site was motivated by a "political agenda" in the White House, brought on by pressure from Hollywood bosses to crack down on internet piracy.Dotcom said prosecutor tactics in laying criminal charges and pre-emptively taking down the Megaupload site amounted to "hacking the legal system".The new site, which will outstrip rival sites by offering users 50GB of free storage, was in part motivated by his growing awareness of "how the US government operates and how much spying is actually going on, how much privacy intrusion is the reality today", he said.Dotcom said that US prosecutors' pursuit ofAaron Swartz, the Reddit co-founder and activist who killed himself last week, mirrored his own treatment. While reluctant to discuss the details of the Swartz case, he identified "similarities in the way we have been prosecuted: over-reaching abuse of power, no due process – just completely insane, both of our cases".He also expressed sympathy for Julian Assange, who remains holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy following an order that he travel to Sweden to answer sexual assault claims. "I think Julian Assange's fear, that the Swedish government is co-operating with the US government and that there might be an attempt to extradite him from Sweden, is very real. So I sympathise with him. I see also similarities and abuses that are happening in the case against WikiLeaks that were happening to us," he said.The extradition hearing for Dotcom and three of his New-Zealand-based colleagues has been delayed repeatedly amid protracted court battles, which have seen a series of victories for his defence, including a finding that search warrants were invalid, that the search was illegally conducted, and that the FBI should return cloned data. The hearing is  set for August this year.Dotcom said he was looking forward to the hearing taking place. "We want to expose what has happened here. We have a lot of information that shows the political interference. We feel that what happened here was manufactured to destroy Megaupload, and we want to show that," he said.
The partner of the internet activist Aaron Swartz, who killed himself earlier this week, has blamed his suicide on the stress of his prosecution.Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman said she was "absolutely confident" that Swartz killed himself because of the case, in which he was being prosecuted for downloading academic articles from a university archive.Swartz, 26, a prominent open-internet advocate who helped build Reddit and RSS, wasfound deadin the Brooklyn apartment he shared with Stinebrickner-Kauffman on January 11. They started dating a few weeks before Swartz was indicted in 2011.He was set to go on trial next month for downloading academic articles from JSTOR, an online academic journal library, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. If convicted, he could have faced a 30-year jail sentence, although it emerged this week that he had been offered a six-month term in a plea bargain. "The legal system has lost all sense of mercy and justice and it has been replaced with punitiveness and vindictiveness," Stinebrickner-Kauffmantold Mail Online."Felony charges change the course of people's lives. There are things Aaron maybe wanted to do – like go into government – and it's just ludicrous that one act like this could prevent somebody like him from serving his country. The risk was too much for him."Stinebrickner-Kauffman also provided the Mail with photos of the couple's last evening together, which they spent at a New York bar Swartz wanted to go to, and where they dined on his favorite foods: grilled cheese sandwiches and macaroni and cheese."I feel that Aaron's friends and family deserve to know that he had lots of happy moments in his last few weeks," Stinebrickner-Kauffman said. "As well as the world needing to hear the systemic problems that led to his death people need to know that we had lots of happy moments together."Strinebrickner-Kauffman is the executive director and founder of SumOfUs, a movement that attempts to counterbalance the power of corporations. She said that Swartz would take the subway with her to work, but the morning of January 11, he told her he wanted to stay home and rest."I wanted to stay with him but he said he didn't want me to and that I should go to the office," Strinebrickner-Kauffman said. "So I did."She found him that evening, dead of an apparent suicide in their apartment.Swartz's family released a statementwith Stinebrickner-Kauffman late the next day and said Swartz's death was the product of prosecutorial overreach for "an alleged crime that had no victims". They also faulted MIT for not offering support in his legal battles and not standing up for "its own community's most cherished principles."The US federal prosecutor handling Swartz's case, Carmen Ortiz,responded to these accusations in a statement on Wednesdayand said that her office was enforcing the law "reasonably." Ortiz said that the office never told Swartz's attorneys that they intended to seek the maximum penalties."The prosecutors recognized that there was no evidence against Mr Swartz indicating that he committed his acts for personal financial gain, and they recognized that his conduct – while a violation of the law – did not warrant the severe punishments authorized by Congress and called for by the sentencing guidelines in appropriate cases," Ortiz said.An outpouring of tributes appeared onlinefollowing Swartz's death, including comments from the man credited with creating the internet,Tim Berners-Lee, who wrote on Twitter: "Aaron dead. World wanderers, we have lost a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down. Parents all, we have lost a child. Let us weep."Silicon Valley congresswomanZoe Lofgren is working on legislationto change the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act called "Aaron's law"."His family's statement about this speaks volumes about the inappropriate efforts undertaken by the US government," Lofgren said. "There's no way to reverse the tragedy of Aaron's death, but we can work to prevent a repeat of the abuses of power he experienced. We should prevent what happened to Aaron from happening to other internet users."A public memorial is set to be heldat New York's Cooper Union on Saturday.
Well, the snow has arrived and inevitably Britain's infrastructure has collapsed. If you were planning to get away this weekend, you might as well forget it – instead, you can either spend the next two days taking Instagram photos of your kids in the snow (no one else will have thought of that), or you can retire to your bed and play video games.And just in case you don't have anything new to try, here are five excellent titles that can be quickly downloaded to your phone, console, laptop or tablet. Weekend sorted.Kentucky Route Zero(Cardboard Computer, PC)Take the classic point-and-click adventures of the nineties add some surreal indie character and you get Kentucky Route Zero, an intriguing existential road movie of a game. The narrative follows a delivery man who finds himself traveling along the eponymous hidden highway interacting with strange locals. Part one in a five-part series is available now.Retro City Rampage(Vblank Entertainment, XBLA, PSN, PC, WiiWare)Grand Theft Auto transported back to the 8bit era is the high concept behind this thoroughly entertaining open-world comedy romp. You're the criminal underling pulling off insane missions around the streets of Theftopolis, running over pedestrians and drinking in the clever references to classic games. It's frenzied, furious stuff and the laughs come as thick as bullets. Unmissable for GTA fans and retro gaming nostalgics.Joe Danger Touch(Hello Games, iOS)An absolutely beautiful translation of this hugely popular motorbike stunt sim, which takes the original's intricate control system and perfectly rebuilds it for the touchscreen. Pull wheelies, jump obstacles, swipe barriers out of your way and attain biking glory. A triumphant conversion – and hours of challenging fun.Hundreds(SemiSecret, iOS)A fantastically absorbing puzzler from Adam Saltsman, the indie genius behind Canabalt. Touch the circles to make them grow, thereby adding points to an onscreen ticker – you have to get it to 100 to complete the level, but if your finger is on a circle when it hits another shape, you lose. The difficulty curve is long and smooth, gradually working you toward some fiendish physics challenges. Minimalist puzzling perfection.Gunman Clive(Bertil Hörberg, 3DS, iOS, Android)This stylised cowboy platformer has been around on iOS and Android for a while, but the new 3DS version does a great job of converting those scratchy pencil visuals into tstereoscopic three-dimensionality. It's compelling retro stuff, throwing traps, boss battles and waves of enemy gunslingers at you – like Streets of Rage mashed up with a really weird spaghetti western.
Every day on London's streets, fleets of buses jostle for space, their red liveries bearing the names of many different operators. On board, the bell rings, children draw on misted windows and passengers frown as someone shouts "I'm on the bus" into their mobile.Phones and double deckers may not mix, but the auction format developed to privatise London Regional Transport is now being used to sell space on the spectrum of radio waves. A version refined by telecoms watchdog Ofcom will be used this month to sell airspace for 4G superfast mobile internet.In 1994, when London Regional Transport was fully privatised, the auction planners had a complex problem to solve. Economies of scale meant operators preferred to bid for bundles of routes rather than individual ones, but not every operator wanted the same combination.The solution, often cited by the academics who help design sales of public assets today, was a "combinatorial" auction that allowed unlimited numbers of bids on many different bundles. The winners would be chosen from the combination of bids that provided the best value. Honed over the years, the format has been used to sell everything from timber in Australia to nursing home contracts in Sweden.Ofcom's variant, known as the combinatorial clock and first used in 2008, is so complicated that the eventual selection of bidders will be done by computers, using algorithms to weigh thousands of separate bids to find the highest total.Up for grabs is the biggest chunk of the electromagnetic spectrum ever put on the market by a British government. So intense is the demand for faster smartphone connections, networks are expected to pay handsomely for the new licences: the government is expecting to raise £3.5bn – so confident is it indeed that George Osborne has already assumed he has got the cash.It is a large sum for the public purse, but still a fraction of the £22.5bn handed over in 2000 for 3G licences, when the industry was dizzy with dotcom dreams.The spectrum being auctioned is in two bands, known as the 800MHz and the 2600MHz, and will be divided into 28 different lots. Buyers can bid for different packages of lots, leading to a potential 3,000 combinations. Before the auction begins, prudent bidders will have drawn up separate business plans for each of these thousands of combinations.Each bidder can be expected to spend £3m-£10m on running the process, says Stefan Zehle of telecoms management consultancy Coleago. In sealed war rooms within their offices, with back-up locations in case of power or IT failures, each network will assemble a team of as many as 20 or 30, with mathematical economists and game theorists joining lawyers, accountants and network engineers."The amount spent on a spectrum auction is so staggeringly large you have to do everything to get it right," says Zehle.After mock auctions and training, preliminary bidding is scheduled for the end of this month, with the auction beginning in earnest a day later. About six rounds will be held each day for a number of weeks.Ofcom announces a price for each lot in each round, and bidders specify what combination of lots they would most like to win at those prices. In what is known as the clock stage, the price ticks up, until all bidders reach their limits.Any unsold spectrum will be thrown into a final round. Finally, Ofcom will work out the combination of bids that fetches the most money. The winners won't pay the price they bid; they will pay just a bit more than the second highest bidder – as in an eBay auction. Winners could be announced in early March, with 4G services arriving in May and June.In order to prevent participants from colluding to keep the price low or force a competitor out, bidding is blind. Buyers don't know what their rivals are offering or which lots they are chasing. This is where the game theorists come in."At the end of each day, as the auction unfolds, you can discover what other bidders are most interested in and how much they value it, and all this information you can feed back into your own decisions," says Zehle.The seven bidders include all four mobile phone networks – O2, Vodafone, Everything Everywhere and Three – which all want to get hold of the valuable 800 airwaves. This low frequency spectrum is better at penetrating walls and also travels further, requiring fewer masts. It is ideal for nationwide networks that want to reach into rural areas.After the cheaper 2600 airwaves is BT, which could use wireless to extend its fixed line broadband network into harder to reach locations.The final two bidders, also thought to be interested in the higher frequency spectrum, are Hong Kong conglomerate PCCW, which already runs a small-scale 4G network on the South Bank in London, and the British network company MLL Telecom.The UK auction has been structured in such a way that some experts say only three of the four mobile networks are likely to come away with 800 spectrum. This will make for intense competition, but some expect the UK's smallest and least profitable network, Three, will eventually drop out, thus setting a ceiling for the price Vodafone and O2 will pay.Based on recent 4G auctions in Italy and Ireland, in which Three participated, analyst Daniel Gleeson at IHS Screen Digest reckons the company is not prepared to pay more than 75 euro cents (63p) per megahertz per head of population, a common measure for valuing spectrum.If that holds true, the UK's 4G sale will raise just £2.7bn. "That is very low compared to what the government are hoping for," says Gleeson. "If you wanted to hit the Treasury's number all the lots would need to go for the highest prices that spectrum has been valued for in Europe over the last couple of years."The Treasury could get lucky – Britain is Europe's most competitive mobile market and smartphone use is ramping up at such a rate that networks are running out of space. Although more airwaves are being cleared for sale later, the last auction was 13 years ago and it will be a while before the next one arrives. In that respect, spectrum is nothing like the buses.
It's time for our weekly roundup of brand new Android apps – and that's new as in newly-released, rather than new updates to old apps. In a busy week, we're back up to a Top 30 post.The weekly iOS roundup will follow later in the day. For now, here's this week's pick of the Android world:Talking Angela (Free)This is the latest app in Outfit7's series of Talking Friends apps, following Talking Tom Cat, Talking Ginger and others.

No NFL players here, but plenty of monsters and wizards. It includes elements of card-battling and real-time dungeon dust-ups.Weather° (Free)On a day when the UK is getting to grips with snow all over the shop, here's an app claiming to be "The most beautiful weather app. Ever." It serves up current weather conditions and future forecasts around the world, with swipe-centric controls and eye-catching widgets.D.O.T. Defender of Texel (Free)Here's another game from DeNA (well, its Mobage subsidiary) which sees you doing battle with robots and dragons in a pixelly 8-bit universe. Your job is to explore the world, evolve your characters and tinker with battle formations to get the best results.PBA Bowling Challenge (Free)Bowling games have a long heritage on mobile phones – Jamdat Bowling was one of the first big downloadable hits back in the pre-iPhone days. PBA Bowling Challenge is thankfully bang up to date, getting you to virtually bowl against 21 famous (if you follow the sport) ten-pin bowling stars.Simple (Free)Simple is a US thing for the moment, but it's interesting: a digital bank (a bit like FirstDirect on this side of the Atlantic) with a new Android app for people to manage their accounts. Helpful features for budgeting and tracking spending add to its appeal.DeezCovr (Free)This app is built using APIs from streaming music service Deezer. The focus is on discovering new music, with the app recommending songs and artists you might like, adapting them based on your mood, and then saving the ones you like to a playlist in your Deezer account.Inaugural 2013 (Free)As Barack Obama prepares to be sworn in for his second term as US president, here's an official app for the inauguration celebration. It promises a livestream of the event, as well as other related info. Note: the app isprovoking debate in the USover what data it collects on users.The Lords of Midnight (£2.99)A title to bring a nostalgic glow to the eyes of gamers of a certain age: this is a 2013 update of Mike Singleton's 1984 adventure The Lords of Midnight. It sees you exploring the land of Midnight while also commanding armies to fend off a witch king named Doomdark. It was an 8-bit Skyrim! Sort of...Asura Cross (Free)Here's an entirely modern game from Gamevil: an "adventure fighting" title that sees you building up hero Jin to fight against a series of mysterious foes. Eight game modes and a local multiplayer option provide plenty of action to chew on.Crazy Blind Date by OKCupid (Free)Dating service OKCupid has a new spin on location-based romance: "You just tell us when and where you'd like to go, and we set you up with one of our millions of awesome singles," claims its Google Play listing.

It enables film fans to browse trailers, photos and descriptions for this year's entries, while also providing a guide to the event, including screening schedules and visitor information.Gunslugs (£1.65)Gunslugs is a brand new game influenced by some old classics, featuring "a bunch of expendable action hero's [sic] from the 80s". So yes, also inspired by The Expendables films. Random level generation and unlockable characters look like keeping the challenge fresh in this side-scrolling romp.Lumen: Playground Beta (Free)One of the fun things about Android gaming is getting to play some games in beta before their commercial release. Lumen Playground is an early look at developer Sockeater Studios' upcoming Lumen game, which already looks like a beautiful thing, as you roll a ball through a series of lush environments.GroupVox (Free)A few years ago, the idea of Push-To-Talk (PTT for short) was all the rage among some mobile operators, who thought adding walkie-talkie features to phones was The Future. It wasn't. Can the idea make a comeback with apps? GroupVox hopes so: it's a walkie-talkie app for talking to your Facebook friends, including the ability to record messages for people when they're offline.Jongla (Free)More messaging, but this time the instant variety. Jongla is a new cross-platform messaging app with hopes (even if they're slim hopes) of taking on WhatsApp and the like. Sharing photos and locations is included, and the app uses push notifications to ensure messages aren't missed.Colosseum Defense (Free)Another game from Gamevil, this is more of a tower defence-style title where you tap the screen to shoot at the waves of monsters trying to storm your castle. Weapons upgrades and magic help your efforts, with a boss hoving into view every 10 levels to test your progress.Gaana (Free)Gaana, like rivals Dhingana and Saavn, is an Indian streaming music service that's available worldwide, catering for anyone keen to listen to songs from that country as well as Western tracks. It has more than 1m tracks available, and recommendations to help you mine the catalogue.Tupsu-The Furry Little Monster (Free)Physics-puzzlers have become one of the most popular genres on smartphones and tablets, with Tupsu hoping to become as big a hit (or, at least, nearly as big) as Cut the Rope's Om Nom. It sounds like painful work though: you play the game by linking Tupsu's waggly eyes to floating islands in order to propel him around the screen collecting stars.Lode Runner Classic (£1.99)Here's some good news for retro gamers with a yen for the days of the Apple II computer. It's a conversion of Lode Runner, collecting all 150 levels of the original. New to it? It's a platform game where your stickman hero runs around collecting gold and dodging enemies.Diglr (Free)Lots of social location apps have crashed and burned in the last couple of years, so the jury's out on whether Diglr has what it takes to catch on. It's an interesting idea though: aiming to connect likeminded people based on their interests and locations around specific events.Never Be Bored UK (Free)If you do a lot of travelling around the UK, Never Be Bored's Android app may be as useful as its website. It throws up guides to restaurants and bars, evenings out, shops, sport and leisure venues and tourism hotspots, as well as hotels and B&amp;Bs. The people behind it want users to share their own recommendations too, to help its database grow.CleverLock (£1.01)One of a number of apps designed to make Android handsets child-safe (or, rather, keep a parent's emails, data and apps safe from children's wandering hands). It's a simple way to lock off certain applications with a password before handing a device over to a child.Umano: News Read to You (Free)Why would you want the news read to you on a smartphone? No, not lazy eyes. Think driving, for one. Umano promises "real people with amazing voices read interesting news articles to you", with a dash of personalisation as you choose which categories you're interested in.Yelo : Cheap Calls Worldwide (Free)Voice-over-IP apps are plentiful on Android, so Yelo is one more for the list – albeit one claiming to be lots cheaper than Skype, Jajah and other similar apps when calling mobile and landlines. As ever with these apps, scrutinise the terms and conditions before diving in.Gene Effect (£2)Finally, one more game this week: a side-scrolling action game that sees you exploring mines on a planet called Kratoss. Puzzles, ship upgrades and randomly-generated levels hope to hold your attention.That's this week's selection, but what Android apps have you been enjoying? Post your recommendations or views on the apps above in a comment.
Google's chief executive Larry Page has taken a swipe at Facebook and Apple, claiming the giant social network is "doing a really bad job on their products" and that the iPhone maker's limited range of products is "unsatisfying".In aninterview with Wired magazine, carried out last year before Facebook had launched its new Graph Search tool, Page, 39, tells Steven Levy that he wants the company he co-founded to come up with ideas that are "moon shots" – such as the self-driving car now being introduced in some American states – and that he isn't worried about breaking laws in some cases if the result is a better product.He is also critical of the technology press, saying that "stories are written as if they [journalists] are covering a sporting event. But it's hard to find actual examples of really amazing things that happened solely due to competition."In a swipe at Facebook, he says that although it is a company that is strong in the social space, "they're also doing a really bad job on their products … we're actually doing something different [from Facebook]. I think it's outrageous to say that there's only space for one company in these areas." He compares it with the point at which Google started as a search company in 1997 and was told the market was crowded because other businesses already offered it. "We said, 'We are a search company, but we're doing something different.'"Though he doesn't specify what aspect of Facebook's products is "really bad", Page may be hinting at the problems the social network has had over privacy settings – an area with which Google is familiar, having beenbound over for 20 years by the Federal Trade Commissionfor failing to respect users' privacy when itset up its Google Buzz networkin 2010.Many people see Google+ as Google's attempt to build a rival social network to Facebook, although it works more as a "glue" that ties together users' searches and activity across multiple Google sites – though it also offers Facebook friend-like "Circles" to connect to friends and others.Although Vic Gundotra of Google has claimed it has 500m registered users – compared with more than a billion for Facebook – many of those appear to have come about through default settings rather than active creation of accounts, as happens on Facebook. Even Google's own data suggests that engagement is comparatively low, with about 125m using it regularly. Google has not broken out specific data about how many people use the social elements of Google+ to share information every day or month – meaning no simple comparison can be made with Facebook.But Page says of Google+: "I'm very happy with how it has gone … a lot of it has been copied by our competitors, so I think we're doing a good job." He doesn't specify what parts have been copied.Of Apple, Page suggests that it lacks ambition to change the world. "You know, we always have these debates: we have all this money, we have all these people, why aren't we doing more stuff? You may say that Apple only does a very, very small number of things, and that's working pretty well for them. But I find that unsatisfying."Instead he wants Google to work for "moon shots" that will change the world. He points to Google's introduction in 2003 of its Gmail product, which then offered 1GB of storage for free – an amount and price that shocked the market, where web providers such as Microsoft's Hotmail had offered small amounts of storage and paid upgrades."I worry that something has gone seriously wrong with the way we run companies … it's always about the competition."He says that most companies decay over time because they "do approximately what they did before, with a few changes". Such incremental change, he says, "is guaranteed to be obsolete over time."Page's key message is that "there are all these opportunities in the world to use technology to make peoples' lives better".He reveals that when he was a child he wanted to be an inventor, but then realised that many had unhappy lives, citing Nikola Tesla, who first worked with and then split from Thomas Edison; the two spent their later years fighting over the best method to distribute electrical power.He thinks that there is a gap in business at present: "we're not teaching people how to identify those difficult projects" that will have the most impact.He says he wanted to build self-driving cars when he was at Stanford University in 1996-7. "The only thing that changed [to make them real] was that we got the guts to actually do it."But he also indicates that he is not afraid to trample over what existing laws might say in order to achieve his ends. Levy points to the example of Google Book Search, which scanned and stored the contents of books – including ones still under copyright, without the required permission of the author. Page says: "Show me a company that failed because of litigation … Companies fail because they do the wrong things or they aren't ambitious, not because of litigation or competition."He points out that Google was, in effect, illegal when it began: "When we started Google, it wasn't really obvious that what we were doing wouldn't get regulated away. Remember, at the time, people were arguing that making a copy of a file in a computer's memory was a violation of copyright. We put the whole web on our servers, so if that were true, bye-bye search engines."Nor does Page worry about the ongoing litigation in the smartphone market, in which Apple and Microsoft have been suing a number of handset makers using Google's Android mobile software, and Page himself had to testify in a court case last year brought by Oracle over alleged patent and copyright infringements in Android. Oracle's claims were rejected by the jury.Asked about Steve Jobs's threat to go to "thermonuclear war" over what he saw as copying in Android, Page retorts: "How well is that working?" On whether Android's share is decisive against Apple, he sidesteps the question, responding that "Android has been very successful, and we're very excited about it".According to analysts, Android powers around 70% of all smartphones sold in the world, though there are wide regional variations: Android dominates in China, with both Google-approved and non-Google variants taking about 90%, while in the US smartphones running Android currently sell about equally with Apple's iPhone.Page explains that in buying Android, the mobile software company run by Andy Rubin, in 2005, "it was pretty obvious [then] that the existing mobile operating systems were terrible. You couldn't write software for them. So I don't think that betting on Android was that big a stretch."Of Apple's decision to remove Google's Maps as a default for the iPhone, Page declines to comment directly on Apple's action – possibly indicating the value of having Google's search as the default on the platform – but adds: "You may have the greatest maps in the world, but if nobody uses them, it doesn't matter." He suggests that the way mobile platforms especially are becoming more closed means that "companies are trying to wall everything off, and that impedes the rate of innovation."Looking forward, he suggests that in five to ten years the eminently breakable glass that now covers our smartphones will have been replaced with something less fragile. "There's going to be a lot of change." Samsung has already demonstrated a flexible phone screen that can be bent at right angles.Page warns that some proposed laws and regulations, such asthe controversial SOPA law, meant "we were a millimetre away from regulating [the internet] out of existence". The principle of the internet, he suggests, is "under much greater attack than it was in the past. Governments are now more afraid of the internet because of the Middle East stuff [Arab Spring] and so they're a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people's freedoms."But he adds that the response to SOPA,which saw online and physical protests, indicates that "governments fight users' freedoms at their own peril".He even sees a time when Google – which in September 2012 had 53,000 employees – could grow to a million staff. "Anything is scalable," Page says – although he admits that the company is now moving its TGIF (Thank God It's Friday) meeting, at which senior executives makes themselves available to talk to staff on any topic, from Friday to Thursday so that staff in the Asian offices can take part.
A new batch of rumours has surfaced surrounding the next generation games machines from Sony and Microsoft – you'd better get used to this from now on. Gaming site VG 247has spokento developers returning from the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where they claim to have been briefed on the hardware at secret meetings.According to these off-the-record discussions, the Playstation 4 processor, apparently based on the AMD A10 APU, will have a run-capability of 1.84 teraflops. In comparison the next Xbox will be capable of hitting 1.23 teraflops – giving PS4 a raw computational advantage. However, it seems that while the PS4 (or Orbis as it has been codenamed) will feature 4GB of system RAM, the 720 (or 'Durango', or indeed 'Infinity) will squeeze in 8GB, 4-5GB of which will be solely for games. This contradicts various rumours the Guardian has heard that both systems will feature 4GB of RAM.There are also strong indications that both Microsoft and Sony will run their own events this spring, possibly as early as March, to announce their new hardware. It may then be shown off in more detail at the vast E3 exhibition in June. This would seem to make sense, allowing the manufacturers to corner the gaming news agenda without having to compete against the madness of a major trade show.Other reportshave also mentioned that the two machines will be able to read 100GB Blu-ray discs. This would represent a major turnaround for Microsoft, having attempted to compete against Blu-ray in the last generation with an Xbox HD DVD player. It's also likely that we'll see some innovation in the user interfaces. Microsoft is rumoured to be building a new version of its Kinect motion control device into Xbox 720, while Sony may well be experimenting with touch controls, basing its next Dual Shock controller on the Vita, complete with a centrally placed touch pad.While there's likely to be plenty of truth in all of this, specifications rarely tell the full story, and computing power is onlypartof the architectural equation in games machines. Just as important tends to be the pipeline between processors, and the way in which memory is managed by the system. Speaking to the Guardian about these performance figures this morning, one developer told us, "that's like asking someone to choose a Lamborghini over a Ferrari,  just on top speed."Richard Leadbetter ofDigital Foundryagrees. "The rumours are certainly plausible, but we're essentially looking at singular components in isolation and not in context of the system as a whole. The PlayStation 3 has a graphics core that is basically an entire generation behind that in the Xbox 360, yet no one can deny that it's Sony's first party games that have led the way in the visual arts."Also, developers the Guardian has talked to have told us that the software and services side will be far more important in the next generation. Which machine will be able to download or stream digitally distributed games the fastest? Which will have the most stable, secure and reliable online infrastructure? With retail sales of physical goods falling, the emphasis is likely to be on downloadable titles – and providing a compelling service rather than raw processing grunt, could be the key to success.Another factor, of course, is price. In a competitive consumer electronics marketplace filled with desirable gadgets, the Xbox and PS4 machines will need to aim as low as possible. Some analysts havepredicted$400 (£250) a piece, which matches the 'pro' Xbox 360 at launch, but is $200 less than the 60GB PS3 when it premiered.A lower price is realistic though, as it seems both consoles are based on off-the-shelf kit this time round, rather than proprietary hardware that's expensive to design and manufacture. Based so closely on known PC components, however, some will want to compare the systems directly against gaming PCs."On a general level, we're looking at medium-level enthusiast PC hardware," says Leadbetter. "My guess is that you could build a PC with equivalent parts for around £400-£450. But the magic of console architecture is that those parts are incorporated into a fixed platform, built principally for games. Just like the PS3 and Xbox 360 before them, these machines will live on for many years – far more than the current-gen PC parts they share equivalent performance to."More – much,muchmore – to follow soon...
Hurray - Friday! What are your weekend plans, you crazy bunch?
A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamO2 urges rivals to stop providing chargers with new phones &gt;&gt; The GuardianO2 has urged its industry peers to stop giving away chargers with new mobile phones, after a trial found the vast majority of customers were happy to buy handsets without chargers.The telecom giant yesterday announced the results of athree-month pilot scheme, which saw it sell HTC One X+ handsets without the USB chargers they usually come with, but still with a detachable USB cable.Greener, and a little bit more profitable - and HTC needs everything it can get just now. But less clutter and waste is definitely welcome.Facebook's VOIP services doesn't seem all that &gt;&gt; sulia.comThe free calling that Facebook rolled out to iOS users yesterday (weirdly undocumented by Facebook; seethe Verge's post insteaddoesn't strike me as ready to take over the world yet.* You can only call other people running Messenger for iOS--which in my case, is only three or four of the people I've chatted with lately. One possible reason: Facebook chats often represent an unwanted intrusion.* Nobody can call you from outside of Facebook--unlike Google Voice and Skype, which give you a real number reachable from other phones, VoIP or not.* Unless you're on a mostly-data plan like T-Mobile's (great!) $30 prepaid deal, you probably already have more voice minutes than you'll ever use.Note the use of the word "yet", though.Tell Apple: reject the NRA's new shooting app &gt;&gt; Signon.orgOn the one month anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, the National Rifle Association launched a free mobile application for Apple's iPhone and iPad that allows users, even children, to shoot at targets with various types of guns, including assault weapons. Initially the app was recommended for users as young as 4. On January 15th, Apple responded to our concerns by raising the recommended age to 12 and adding warnings of graphic violence (http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nra-shooting-game-longer-preschoolers-18223790). This is a step in the right direction, but the app itself is shameless, insensitive and counterproductive, whether played by a 4-year-old or a teenager. We ask Apple to rescind approval of it.The thorny question: isn't suppressing this app restricting freedom of "speech" (in the form of representation on a screen)? Why is it bad for Apple to suppress an app about drone attacks but not to suppress one about guns? And if it rejects this one, should it also then suppressallgames involving guns?Samsung's China problem &gt;&gt; Benedict EvansThis is data [in a graph in the post] from Baidu showing the share of Android pageviews on its properties that devices from each Android vendor generated. Samsung has about 50% of Android shipments globally - but not in China. 'Other', the swarm of over a thousand small manufacturers making generic devices with (mainly) Mediatek chipsets, is squeezing all the branded OEMs and pushing prices down relentlessly...Almost none of these ["Other"] devices have any Google services on them, incidentally.Then again, it's even worse for the other Android names - HTC, Huawei, Motorola, ZTE and Lenovo. Besides "Other", only Lenovo has grown its share year-on-year.Your smartphone will replace your car keys by 2015 &gt;&gt; Wired.comYour smartphone has the potential to replace nearly everything else in your pockets, so why not your car keys? Hyundai is working to do just that, with an embedded NFC tag that allows you to open your car, start the engine and link up to the touchscreen with a simple swipe.You don't have to think for long to think of at least two serious security flaws in this system - one which makes the car too accessible, the other which makes it inaccessible.Why Will Self's outsider's view of gaming is thought-provoking, despite the common misconceptions &gt;&gt; Edge OnlineSteven Poole:Every so often, a celebrated littérateur opines on the subject of videogames, having just discovered or rediscovered them. A few years ago, novelist John Lanchester asked of the medium: "Is it art?" (His answer: maybe, one day.) NowWill Self has written an essay for the London Review Of Booksabout how his sons are obsessed with games, and - in a lovely flight of metacritical fancy - wondering what the literary theorist Northrop Frye would have made of it all.Worth it for the picture of Self alone at the top, but also demonstrates that games writers can throw around mythico-narrative scenarios with phantasmagorical allegories with the best of them.The debate over online anonymity &gt;&gt; WSJ.comBen Rooney:This month [Schleswig-Holstein data protection commissioner Thilo] Weigert wrote to Facebook threatening to fine the social media company for failing to allow the state's citizens to use their service anonymously or pseudonymously, in breach of German law.Facebook rejects Mr. Weigert's ruling, saying "We believe the orders are without merit, a waste of German taxpayers' money and we will fight it vigorously." But this dispute is more than simply another "European country angry at big US company" story. This cuts right to the heart of a long-standing Internet debate -- do we have the right to be anonymous online?This has serious consequences in the real world. The Irish parliament is investigating the role of social media in a public debate following the suicide of Irish politician Shane McEntee after a campaign of abuse, some of it on social media. Furthermore, a recent study by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that vituperative comments on science articles affected how people perceived the validity of the science. The less civil the accompanying comments, the more risk readers attributed to the research, a finding that has implications for the public understanding of science.There's a slight elision there: are people necessarily polite just because they use their real (Facebook) IDs? There are plenty of examples of Facebook comments that are far from polite. The particular point about the research is surprising (and worrying), though.Google Nexus tops iPad In Japan's holiday season sales &gt;&gt; NikkeiThe iPad from Apple Inc. got knocked off its throne as king of the tablets in Japan during the year-end sales season, bowing to the lower-priced Nexus from Google Inc.The data comes from a store survey. Not participating in the survey: Apple's physical stores. Also not participating: Apple's online store, Amazon's online store, Google's online store. In all, those might make up half of sales - rendering this survey moot. More and more, retail studies don't tell us anything helpful when there are alternative outlets - especially online ones. Which leaves us at the mercy of analysts or the companies' whims in deciding whether to release actual sales figures. Up to now, only RIM, Nokia and Apple actually do release figures for phone and tablet sales.The market wants Apple to unveil a time machine &gt;&gt; Harvard Business ReviewDan Pallotta:So Tim Cook has not introduced any disruptive new products in his first year. But bear in mind that four years elapsed from the time Steve Jobs took back the reins until the iPod was introduced. Six years elapsed between the introduction of the iPod and the iPhone. Six years without a disruption under Steve Jobs. During that time, we had to endure the unveiling of flops and iterations like the iPad Hi-Fi, leather iPod pouches, and the iPod Photo. Yes, Steve Jobs actually unveiled a leather iPod pouch on stage. That was an underwhelming day. Another three years went by without a disruption until the iPad was unveiled -- and at the time, many didn't view it as a disruption at all.Leather iPod pouches. *shivers*.

Global tablet shipments were estimated at around 130 million units in 2012.That 180m figure would be roughly half the expected volume of PC shipments.You can followGuardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard.

Google has completed a £1bn property deal to move its UK headquarters to a brownfield site in London's King's Cross area.The US technology giant has purchased a 2.4 acre site between King's Cross and St Pancras stations and plans to build a seven and 11 storey complex due to be complete in 2016.Google already has two central London offices – one in Victoria and one on St Giles High Street – from where staff are expected to be relocated.The move forms part of the regeneration of the King's Cross area following the opening of the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras in 2007. Organisations that have moved into the area since then include  Guardian News &amp; Media, publisher of MediaGuardian, and art college Central St Martin's.Google's purchase mirrors its property strategy in Dublin, where it bought a building outright for 2,000 staff in 2011.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
