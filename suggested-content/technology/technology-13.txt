A little-known feature of the HTML5 specification means that websites can find out how much battery power a visitor has left on their laptop or smartphone – and now, security researchers have warned that that information can be used to track browsers online.The battery status API is currently supported in the Firefox, Opera and Chrome browsers, and was introduced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, the organisation that oversees the development of the web’s standards) in 2012, with the aim of helping websites conserve users’ energy. Ideally, a website or web-app can notice when the visitor has little battery power left, and switch to a low-power mode by disabling extraneous features to eke out the most usage.W3C’s specification explicitly frees sites from needing to ask user permission to discover they remaining battery life,arguing that“the information disclosed has minimal impact on privacy or fingerprinting, and therefore is exposed without permission grants”. But ina new paper from four French and Belgian security researchers, that assertion is questioned.The researchers point out that the information a website receives is surprisingly specific, containing the estimated time in seconds that the battery will take to fully discharge, as well the remaining battery capacity expressed as a percentage. Those two numbers, taken together, can be in any one of around 14 million combinations, meaning that they operate as a potential ID number. What’s more, those values only update around every 30 seconds, however, meaning that for half a minute, the battery status API can be used to identify users across websites.For instance, if a user visits a website in Chrome’s private browsing mode using a VPN, the website should not be able to link them to a subsequent visit with private browsing and the VPN off. But the researchers warn that that may no longer work: “Users who try to revisit a website with a new identity may use browsers’ private mode or clear cookies and other client side identifiers. When consecutive visits are made within a short interval, the website can link users’ new and old identities by exploiting battery level and charge/discharge times. The website can then reinstantiate users’ cookies and other client side identifiers, a method known as respawning.”Worse still, on some platforms, the researchers found that it is possible to determine the maximum battery capacity of the device with enough queries, creating a semi-permanent metric to compare devices.
The person or people who decapitated a hitchhiking robot in Philadelphia narrowly escaped having their pictures captured by the android, its co-creator told the Guardian on Monday.Hitchbot, which was attempting to travel from the east coast of the US to the west coast after setting off from Massachusetts on 17 July, was set upon on Saturday morning and shall hitchhike no more.But Frauke Zeller, a professor at Ryerson University in Toronto and co-creator of Hitchbot, said the roaming robot’s attackers had narrowly missed being photographed.“It didn’t take any pictures unfortunately of the culprits,” Zeller said. “They were lucky because it takes images every 20 minutes so it must have been in-between that interval.”Powered by rechargeable batteries and solar panels, Hitchbot took regular photographs which were posted to its Twitter, Instagram and Facebook pages.The robot, which had a GPS enabling fans totrack its progress online, had set out from Massachusetts on 17 July as part of an art project-cum-scientific experiment. Hitchbot had drawn up a bucket-list of preferred cities and experiences and relied on strangers to transport him westwards.The dangers of hitchhiking were highlighted on Saturday, however, when Hitchbot was dismembered and his head removed in downtown Philadelphia. Hitchbot’s head is yet to be found.“We can see on all our data that the tablet and battery and everything shut off at the same time so it must have been when they vandalised the bot,” said Zeller.Hitchbot was designed by Zeller and a small team of Canadian scientists and had previously completed a coast-to-coast trip across Canada.Zeller said that fans should not read too much into the fact that Hitchbot met an untimely demise in the US after having completed a triumphant Canadian trip.“I really believe this could have happened anywhere. Robots can trust humans but there’s always some people anywhere that might have issues for any reason,” she said.“I really want to emphasise I don’t think it has anything to do with the States nor with Philadelphia.”She said Hitchbot’s body had been found by some good samaritans who had located the roving robot through a regularly updated map on its website.“They sent us images and it’s really beyond repair. There’s not a single wire inside and all the things are broken.”Hitchbot was made from a modified bucket, and had an LED-powered smiling face. The drifting device was easily identifiable with its blue arms and legs, offset by yellow wellington boots and gloves.Hitchbot had become something of an internet celebrity prior to its death, with tens of thousands of people following its adventures through social media. Fans might find some solace in the fact that Hitchbot had packed a lot into its short life. In addition to the26-day jauntacross Canada in the summer of 2014, the robot hadenjoyed a boat rideoff the coast of Massachusetts in July andhad also visitedTimes Square in New York City.Hitchbot in Times SquareIt waslast seenwith Jesse Wellens and “Ed Bassmaster”, two popular YouTube pranksters who took the robot for a drive around Philadelphia. Zeller said the pair had dropped Hitchbot off at the side of the road – as travel companions are advised to do – so that the next person could offer him a ride.Sadly, that ride would never come. Hitchbot was attacked between 6 and 7am. Bassmaster denied having anything to do with it:I would never harm a robot so please stop asking if I did.&mdash; Ed Bassmaster (@edbassmaster)August 2, 2015“We know that many of Hitchbot’s fans will be disappointed, but we want them to be assured that this great experiment is not over,” read a post on Hitchbot’s website, attributed to the device’s “family”.“We have no interest in pressing charges or finding the people who vandalized Hitchbot; we wish to remember the good times, and we encourage Hitchbot’s friends and fans to do the same.”Zeller said Hitchbot’s remains would be shipped back to Canada. Funeral arrangements are yet to be made, but Hitchbot will be memorialised on its website.
A “brain training” game improves the cognitive function of people with schizophrenia and facilitates everyday tasks,according to researchersat the University of Cambridge.Wizard, which will now be available on iOS (Apple’s operating system) as part of the Peak app, was tested for four weeks by 22 participants with a schizophrenia diagnosis.Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition which can contribute to behavioural changes, confused thinking, apathy and, in some cases, delusions or hallucinations.People with schizophrenia may experience cognitive impairments, including poorepisodic memory, which affects remembering things such as times and dates, and understanding context.Wizard aims to improve the cognitive functionality and episodic memory of people with schizophrenia, with in-game tasks including users moving through rooms and identifying items in boxes and character locations.Professor Barbara Sahakian, who developed the game alongside Tom Piercy at Cambridge, said: “We need a way of treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as problems with episodic memory, but slow progress is being made towards developing a drug treatment. So thisproof-of-concept studyis important because it demonstrates that the memory game can help where drugs have so far failed.“Because the game is interesting, even those patients with a general lack of motivation are spurred on to continue the training.”Another member of the research team,Peter Jones, added that further studies with larger sample sizes would need to be carried out to confirm the current findings, but that: “in conjunction with medication and current psychological therapies, [Wizard] could help people with schizophrenia minimise the impact of their illness on everyday life.”People with schizophrenia often find studying and work difficult due to cognitive impairments. The employment rate for people with schizophrenia was recorded at 8%, according to a2013 paper.The Wizard game will be included as a mode within the popular brain-training app,Peak, after it began a partnership with Cambridge in April 2015.“This new app will allow the Wizard memory game to become widely available, inexpensively. State-of-the-art neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, combined with the innovative approach at Peak, will help bring the games industry to a new level and promote the benefits of cognitive enhancement,” Professor Sahakian said.
Apparently Richard Dawkinsdoes not exist– which is awkward, given everything he says about God.Confusing cosmic glitchpic.twitter.com/kQeu6L3OVe&mdash; Isabel Hardman (@IsabelHardman)July 30, 2015Dawkins is one of the latest Twitter users to have “disappeared”.Although messages about people not existing on the social network are legitimate when users have deleted their accounts, recently there has been a spate of tweeters being erased. These disappearances – without warning – can cause sudden panic and in some cases existential crises.This happened to me this month. The only reason I didn’t fret was that I had seen other people tweeting about it over the course of the past few weeks. A few minutes later, I reappeared. Phew.Some users, however, have been alarmed. I imagine them spreading their hands out in front of them, checking flesh and bone:Why does my Twitter keep telling me I don&#39;t exist😟&mdash; Beth❀ (@xbeth_axe)August 3, 2015So...Twitter is telling me I don&#39;t exist again...but I&#39;m pretty sure I do?

It’s Monday. Today’s screenshot is from Retro Invasion, a co-op brawler by German studio, Threaks. The game is now on Steam early access (or will be tomorrow – the press release is ambiguous).
JourneyPS4, Sony, cert: EOne of2012’s best gamesglides softly on to current-gen consoles.Journeyis an interesting beast, a serene and ethereal antidote to a medium fixated on the fast and loud. The player takes up the role of a nameless wanderer amid the desert ruins of a once-great civilisation, able only to float around and produce mournful musical chimes. As you surf the sand dunes and drift in the breeze, sometimes you are alone and other times another singing wanderer guides your way…Journeyis a beautiful thing, an art game, and not necessarily every gamer’s idea of a good time. It’s extremely short and simply designed, even minimalist, with few puzzles to solve and monsters you can only avoid, not fight.The PS4 upgrade makes the rippling sands and sumptuous colours all the grander – but at the same time feels unnecessary becauseJourneywas never “about” hardware specs. It’s about emotion, wordless stories and learning to love complete strangers. That same magical, breathtaking experience remains and is as wonderful as ever.PHTrials Fusion: Awesome Level Max: ‘perfect for anyone who enjoyed the original’.Trials Fusion: Awesome Level Max DLC(PS4, Xbox One, PC, Ubisoft)Downloadable packs that add new tracks to theTrials Fusionmotorcycling game are nothing new. But those that switch bikes for a unicorn-riding feline? That’s something that the series’ creators have understandably saved for DLC, entitledAwesome Level Max, of course. The gameplay follows the same formula as its parent release, guiding a bike – or steed – through demanding, obstacle-strewn levels. Here, gravity rules and mastery means understanding the interplay between tyres – or hooves – and terra firma.Fortunately, things are as elegant as ever. Mechanical simplicity and gameplay depth exist in harmony, through stages that offer puzzles to progress that are solved in the saddle. Twenty-two new levels of standard motorcycling are provided, as well as eight where the unicorn becomes available. The latter, seasoned with parodies of tropes from game culture, really stand out through the distinct way the mythical creature handles when ridden by a gun-toting cat, providing an invigorating change of gameplay approach. It is ultimately just more levels but ones that continue the high standard set byTrials Fusionand perfect for anyone who enjoyed the original.WFCricket Captain 2015: ‘moving in the right direction’.Cricket Captain 2015(PC, Childish Things, cert: 3)The development ofCricket Captainhas, on occasion, been reminiscent of a Chris Tavaré innings – slow, painstaking and sometimes difficult to endure. But this year’s iteration represents something of a leap forward after several releases that felt like little more than database updates. Certainly, there are some boundaries here. The graphics in the highlights are much improved, while the ability to manage Indian domestic teams is a nice addition. Equally, the option to coach a player’s fielding or wicketkeeping rather than just their batting or bowling is also welcome, as is the filter that shows a player’s record against different sides, meaning a lineup can be tailored to suit the opposition.However, some easy catches have been missed too. The umpire still makes the wrong signal for byes and needlessly signals a wicket when a batsman is bowled. The lack of an option to release players before the start of the first season, making it impossible to get rid of any dead wood early, also needlessly jars. It will never challengeFootball Managerbut for fans of the summer game this is at least moving in the right direction.RFStar ratings (out of five): Journey *****, Trials Fusion ****, Cricket Captain 2015 ***
When it comes to the rapidly expanding TV and movies division of Seattle-based retailer Amazon, you might expect the company that religiously studies customer order histories, when and how people buy, what they’re buying and a slew of other metrics, to bring that same zeal for data to its slate of original content.After all, Amazon’s much bigger streaming competitor – Netflix – is famously data-driven, living and dying by what users are watching, how long they’re watching and using that to make guesses about what they want to see more of. As Amazon Studios chief Roy Price explains it, though, when it comes to Hollywood – data isn’t everything.“Data is ... helpful,” Price says. “But it’s definitely possible to over or misuse it and apply it in an incorrect context and to ask the data to guide you in too granular a way,” Price says. “For example, some of the articles over time have said things like data has determined that if you’re in a romantic scene, the guy should wear a green shirt, or something like that. And you could say, well, you know – Breaking Bad was successful and Downton Abbey was successful, we have data on that, so we should combine those two shows! There are a lot of cockamamie roads you can go down.“I think you have to take a little bit of a step back and say, what can we say about the biggest shows that made the biggest difference in television over a period of time?”Price is the executive leading the pursuit of the content Amazon decides to chase, the talent it woos and how it goes about the task of convincing Hollywood and everyone else that Netflix isn’t the only new game in town.Amazon already has scored with Transparent, its award-winning, rule-breaking TV show about an aging transgender woman. Next up is a big screen gamble with director Spike Lee’s timely and edgy drama Chi-raq – set amid a backdrop of gun violence in Chicago – which heads to theaters later this year.It’s a reflection of Amazon’s deeper push into content, with the company now preparing to acquire and create original movies that it intends to have limited theatrical releases.A traditionalist and an outsider at the helmPrice was practically born into the business. His grandfather was a co-creator of The Rockford Files, his father was Universal Pictures’ president in the 80s. Price brings a mix of the traditionalist as well as the outsider to Amazon, where he talks about the constant hunt for the kinds of stories other streaming services aren’t telling.“A lot of the shows that made the biggest difference are, to some extent, rule-breaking shows,” he says. “They tend to have someone who’s super-talented who’s trying to do something new. And often the shows are non-intuitive. They’re not the thing you’d necessarily logically expect.“If you come into work and have a really detailed, specific rubric for what the next successful, zeitgeist-y show will be and you’re locked into that particular model of a show, you’ll almost certainly be wrong. Because the next thing is going to be surprising and fun and new. That’s why it’s going to be the next thing.”Finding the next new thing is one way of driving the retailer’s Amazon Prime subscription business. Members pay $99 a year for benefits that include free two-day shipping on their orders and access to Amazon streaming content like music, a library of TV shows and movies that Amazon has acquired, as well as the growing slate of Amazon original shows such as Transparent.Next up are original Amazon films. The company brought on producer Ted Hope in January to lead its original movies unit, the first of which is Lee’s Chi-raq.“It’s our first produced film, and it wrapped 167 days after Ted Hope and I had dinner with Spike at Sundance,” Price says. “Which may be a record.”Amazon has never exhibited much reluctance when it comes to extending its corporate tentacles into a dizzying array of new markets – everything from groceries to cloud computing services – on the road to becoming a company with $89bn in annual revenue. A few days ago Amazon saw its market cap surge past Walmart’s.Its clear that the company wants to be as big a player in media as it is in retail. Transparent scooped up 11 Emmy nominations and was the first online show to pick up a best series Golden Globe.Focused on a transgender family patriarch played by Jeffrey Tambor, Transparent is coming back for a second season later this year and a third season next year.And Amazon’s TV originals and big content deals keep coming. Amazon in recent days announced it’s inked a deal with the former stars of BBC car show “Top Gear” to stream a new car-focused show on Amazon.Big deals keep comingThe deal is rumored to be worth $250m – the same price Amazon founder Jeff Bezos paid for the Washington Post – over 36 episodes, starting next year. The show will carry a different name, though, as the BBC still owns that.On 7 August Amazon will debut pilots for two new shows – Casanova and Sneaky Pete. The former marks the small screen debut of Oscar-nominated director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, whose credits include Amelie, and it chronicles the life of the famed 18th-century playboy.Sneaky Pete is a co-production with Sony Pictures Television. Central to its storyline is a con-man, played by Giovanni Ribisi, who takes the identity of his cellmate Pete after leaving prison.“Sometimes these things come from reaching out to someone who we think is just great and talented and who we’d love to be in business with,” Price says. “Sometimes those things come to fruition immediately, because they have an idea and something they want to do and it lines up with us and boom, we’re off to the races. Other times it’s about forging a relationship and may take a year or two before anything actually becomes an opportunity.“One way it doesn’t tend to happen is where we, like, have an idea for a show, like – oh, I think there should be a show about three people living in an apartment together or whatever it is. It tends to be creator-driven, and they’ve usually got ideas. If you look at our whole development slate, there are probably a couple of examples of every kind of origin story.”Netflix is headed in the same direction. It’s bringing a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon sequel to theaters this summer and has announced plans for a series of new movies with Adam Sandler.The latter, it should be noted, proves how fraught and artistically risky these moves can be. Sandler is a hit on Netflix where his old movies are still very popular. But has that data led Netflix down the wrong path? The first film in the Sandler deal is due for release later this year and has already proved controversial, with word of Native American actors, offended by the film, walking off the set.At a recent gathering of reporters at the Television Critics Association, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said the company still stood behind the Sandler deal, in spite of news like the poor initial reception to Pixels, Sandler’s latest film.The new tech media companies competition for hits is getting ever fiercer. Hulu, which recently paid almost $180m for every episode of Seinfeld, is in the fray, as are others like Yahoo, which bought and revived NBC’s Community.Bezos said in tandem with the company’s fourth quarter earnings release that the company “invested $1.3bn in Prime Instant Video” in 2014, a figure that includes expenses related to its original shows as well as licensing costs for content. Netflix, though, is still the biggest spender, with $3.2bn spent last year on content.And Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible said in a recent report Netflix could very well spend as much as $5bn in 2016.Not all of Amazon’s originals, to be sure, have met with success. Its Silicon Valley-themed “Betas”, which captured none of the buzz of something like HBO’s Silicon Valley, got the axe after one season.Amazon, though, is in this for the long haul – and it’s not worried about size or market share or anybody else’s budget for content, because it thinks the dynamics of the streaming market don’t automatically favor the biggest player.“In the on-demand world, people actually have to demand the show, to proactively choose to watch your show,” Price says. “So it’s unlike, say, broadcast TV in the past, where they may have been watching a great show at eight, and the next show happens to come on and it’s good enough for you to leave the TV on until you get to Frasier at nine.“There’s no such dynamic in this context. If you have a show everybody on earth thinks is pretty fair but no one thinks is pretty great – that show that may have had value in a previous era has zero value now. It creates a requirement that you have content that’s distinct and brings something special to the table.”
Pulling into Old Street underground station in London I can with great accuracy predict who will head for the doors of the train. Not that clean-shaven man in the three-piece business suit; nor that Armani-ed woman who’s probably heading for a City skyscraper. No, Old Street (ironically, given the name) is a magnet for tech-oriented twentysomethings. So how does it feel to be a “grey entrepreneur” blinking in the light of Silicon Roundabout?I’m a former magazine editor (Psychologies,Good Housekeeping,In Style) in my late 50s. When, a few years ago, I wanted to find a therapist to deal with some of life’s harsher blows, I realised that most directories couldn’t give me what I needed. Picking out a face from the hundreds listed was a stab in the dark. Couldn’t you take the sort of algorithm that worked for dating sites, and find the right therapist much more accurately?Related:Sink or swim: why some startups succeed and others don'tAnd so I became the founder ofwelldoing.org. It’s been a gradual development, from readingThe Lean Startupto a week’s work experience on a teen site to get my head around Wordpress (which we no longer use anyway); from being hacked by Isis (I’m not kidding – but we fought them off within a day) to reaching 1,000 therapists enrolled, my small team and I have been demystifying therapy for more than 18 months from my home office. It was only winning a place on Google’s pilot scheme “Founders over 50” that physically brought me into London’s premier tech space.And yes, it does feel strange. Everyone is casually dressed: tattoos/beards/piercings are almost de rigueur for the men; trainers are worn all day (not just during the commute) by the women, while conventional makeup and a blow-dry is almost non-existent. Everybody has a laptop under their arm and quite possibly a couple of million of Series A investment to play with. And I am old enough to be their mother.But does that matter? According to one of my fellow Founders over 50, Suzanne Noble ofFrugl, it can – older entrepreneurs, she says, are viewed less favourably if they’re looking for investment. Having joinedAda’s List(a women in tech support group), I’m also seeing evidence that investors can be pretty sexist too. But when we all pitched at the end of our Google six-week programme, plenty of investors turned up, and a number made contact.Silicon Roundabout in London.Photograph: Jeffrey Blackler/AlamyIt may be commonly believed that the big “disrupters” can only come from the super-young Mark Zuckerberg model – prominent US investor Vinod Khosla has said: “People under 35 make change happen; people over 45 basically die in terms of new ideas”– but actual research shows that startups earning more than $1m have founders with a median age of 39. Even better, twice as many were older than 50 as were younger than 25. As Krisztina Holly wrote inForbeslast year: “More experienced leaders tend to have deeper networks, experience managing teams, and better business savvy and skills for delivering on their vision.”Nonetheless, investors’ ageist attitudes are bolstered by the digital native argument. The fact is that baby boomers like me haven’t grown up with computers. But we can, and do, learn. And for what we might not immediately know about the technical side of things, we do have the benefit of experience with life. Our ideas of “problem-solving” go further than faster takeaway delivery or additional social networks. I knew that users of welldoing.org would stretch from late 20s to 50s, because I’ve spent the past few decades dealing with the reality of that life.Being around younger people infects you with their energy, chutzpah, and taste for green juicesOn the younger person’s side is the fact that they can throw themselves into a startup, mind and body, working through the night, the weekend, whenever. Anyone over 40 is more likely to have a mortgage to pay, partner and family to tend, maybe even parents who need help. Encumbrances perhaps, but all doable.While wanting to stand up for my generation, I’ve also found it thrilling to be setting out in something new, especially as people in tech seem to be so open, and ready to help. Every week, every day – every conversation! – I may learn something I didn’t know before. But then I still have to work out, is it something I need to know or will it be a distraction? It’s all part of the challenge.Being around younger people infects you with their energy, chutzpah, and taste for green juices. That’s why, although the Google scheme has now finished, my tech director, Jamie, assistant Alice and I are now spending a day a week in the cafe atCampus London. It has some of the most uncomfortable chairs my body has ever encountered, and my ears ring with the loud music it plays, yet we scurry to get there by 9.15am to get a table. The buzz of working alongside other startups – overhearing their metrics-filled conversations, seeing the passion in their faces – psychologically fires us all up for the next week’s projects.Louise Chunn is the founder ofwelldoing.org, where users can find the right therapist for their needs, plus information and advice on therapy and wellbeing
Price £18,495MPG 47.1Top speed 127mphIn the footwell of the seat I’m strapped into is a sign that reads: “If the driver’s legs fall off, press here!” That must sound ridiculous to you, but then you aren’t being driven hell-for-leather round the historic Goodwood racetrack by a man with no legs…Davie Birrellis an ex-boxer and former corporal in the Black Watch whose life changed in an instant on 10 April 2010. While on patrol in Helmand, Afghanistan, his interpreter, walking a few yards to his left, stepped on a buried pressure pad which detonated an IED. In that instant, the translator lost his life – and Birrell lost his legs.Earlier, over a coffee, I’d been unsure whether to ask him about his injury. He was joking about in the pit lane in full racing gear, with his helmet on his lap and a pair of prosthetic legs propped against the table. Finally curiosity got the better of me and I just came out with it. “So, Davie, what happened to your legs?” He happily launched into the story, recounting all the horror of the attack as if it was just a big adventure. He’s a great talker and has an astonishingly unsentimental approach to losing his legs. It’s obviously a mental strength that has got him through the dark days and months of his long rehab.Man on a mission: Davie Birrell with his Mazda racing car.Photograph: Mission Motorsport“Once we got hit by the IED, we came under fire straightaway,” he says. “I was screaming my bloody head off so the boys knew I was still alive. All I could feel was this terrible burning in my back. My right leg was absolutely annihilated. I only had one tourniquet, so I tied that on and jabbed in the morphine. When the medics got over to me they jabbed me withmoremorphine…” he rolls his eyes and laughs. “Rounds were flying all over the place. One went right through the stretcher! The boys were brilliant. They had me back to Camp Bastion in 25 minutes. I was conscious through the whole thing…”Davie is nothing if not a man who relishes a challenge. Working withMission Motorsport, a charity which aids in the recovery and rehabilitation of those injured in war, he has not only realised his childhood dream of becoming a racing driver but has set his sights on becoming the first double amputee to compete in the British Touring Car Championships.He shows me the prosthetic legs he uses to drive. “They’re the same as my walking ones,” he says, “but much shorter and lighter, so I can get a sense of the pedals through my stumps. I used to be over 6ft, but in these I’m only 5ft 5in. The only thing I can’t do in the car is heel-toe!”Inside story: the nicely appointed interior.He’s currently racing aMazda MX-5which isn’t modified to his needs in any way. It has a full roll cage and racing suspension – and on the front is a sticker that says @DavieNolegs. “I walk and drive like everyone else,” he tells me. But I know that’s a lie. Yes, he walks perfectly well, but his driving is anything but ordinary.He offers to give me a few passenger laps of Goodwood. It’s terrifying. The car shrieks round each bend at the limit of its tolerances. Why isn’t it bouncing end over end across the grass? Davie, meanwhile, passes the wheel through his hands like a Zen master. He’s totally calm and unflustered, almost bored. He says he’s “not pushing it”. Racing drivers don’t feel fear like the rest of us – and a racing driver who is also a war veteran and former boxer is clearly not going to be bothered about going sideways at 100mph on a wet track. Maybe if someone started taking pot shots at us his pulse might spike up to 73 or something… but I’m not sure.After half a dozen laps, I’ve had enough (a combination of fear and nausea) and we blast back into the pits. We clamber out of his race-prepared Mazda and go and look at the new MX-5 parked nearby.It’s the world’s bestselling roadster and has just celebrated its 25th anniversary. We love them here in Britain – in fact we buy more than half of the MX-5s sold in Europe. I like what it says about our national psyche that we have so taken this little two-seater to our hearts. There are plenty of cars out there which are posher, more powerful and more imposing. But when it comes to likable, affordable, roof-down thrills, nothing comes close.Ship shape: the chopped rear end.This is the fourth generation of the MX-5 – and the best thing about it is that it’s so very like the first. It exudes an irresistible joie de vivre. The controls are straightforward. The roof is old-school fabric and has a simple, easy-to-use mechanism. There are no fancy-pants gadgets here. It is what it is.This latest model is lighter, shorter, lower and wider than the outgoing one and has the lowest centre of gravity yet. All of which gives it a dynamic edge on the road. It’s powered by a 1.5- or 2-litre engine which is nippy rather than fast, and the handling is nimble and responsive. You really do feel at one with it.The design has been sharpened. Pointy headlamps and a chopped rear now make it look like an old Alfa Spider. Peering through the windscreen your view of the road rushing towards you is perfectly framed by the twin front wheel arches. It’s exhilarating and makes you feel like James Dean. (Note to self: buy another polo neck.) The cabin is comfortable and despite its modest proportions has a plump fulsomeness to it. The boot, though, is still a bit crap.One thing, however, that reallyhaschanged is the price. When it was launched in 1990, it cost £14,249 (that’s £31,687 in today’s money), yet 25 years later, with vastly more standard equipment, it costs just £18,495.

How many tech companies are saddled with the problem of enjoying global fame but struggling with lacklustre performance? Not Facebook, which revealed in its results that it has nearly 1.5 billion users logging in each month around the world. Twitter, however, is an example where participation is lagging behind reputation.The company built around text-message-length “tweets” announced in its own quarterly results last week that it has 304 million monthly active users (MAUs), who logged in at least once a month in the past quarter. That figure was up only 0.7% from the previous quarter, while the figure for MAUs in the US stayed stubbornly at 65 million.Yet it is Twitter that is so often cited in news stories, TV coverage and even TV adverts, as established media businesses scramble to generate engagement with a tech-savvy mass of viewers, readers and listeners. Twitter is seen as the easy way to do that: anyone can join, anyone can contact anyone else who’s on it, and it’s free. You can “like” a company on Facebook, and write comments on its page, yet it’s Twitter that is generally treated as the immediate, switched-on source.So why is Twitter struggling financially? Last week the two companies’ results showed their widely divergent fortunes. Facebook’s second-quarter revenue hit $4bn (£2.6bn), up 39% year-on-year, with operating income of $1.3bn, down 8%. Twitter, by contrast, had revenues of $502m – up 61% from last year – but an operating loss of $131m. Facebook is gigantic, growing fast and profitable. Twitter is smaller, growing faster, but loss-making.What the results also showed is that most of Facebook’s growth is coming from mobile users and adverts. That is precisely the space that Twitter – born in 2006 with the idea of taking the “status message” from the desktop to the mobile phone – should be dominating.Just as concerning is the performance of privately held Snapchat, popular with teens for its rapidly self-deleting photos and messages. It does not publish user numbers, but analysts estimate that it has more daily users than Twitter. It is also courting advertisers with increasing success – beginning with publishers on its “Discover” channel, which shows feeds from news organisations.Social messaging service Snapchat, which is privately owned, is thought by some experts to have more users than Twitter.Photograph: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty ImagesFor Rick Summer, an analyst at investment research firm Morningstar, the outlook for Twitter is not good; user growth trends, he says, “are not encouraging”. He adds: “Advertisers have many alternative outlets to reach a larger user base on a targeted and near-to-real-time basis, including Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest. We are concerned that Twitter may not represent a mass-market social media platform.”He has cut his forecast for the shares’ longer term value from $36 to $27, compared with Twitter’s valuation of $45.10 in 2013 when it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Summer’s forecast for total users by 2019 has also been trimmed, from 739 million to just 491 million. Even though that is a compound growth rate of 12%, it is not the rocketing rise that people expect from internet companies.Part of the problem, as Summer says, is that there are so many competing social networks. But some also perceive a loss of focus, which might be ascribed to the changes going on inside the boardroom. In June, Twitter’s chief executive Dick Costolo, appointed in October 2010 after the forced resignation of co-founder Evan Williams, stepped aside amid mounting pressure from Wall Street, investors and the rest of the board.Meanwhile, in the past year around 450 people have left the company,according to a study by theFinancial Times. That constitutes about 12% of the firm, and includes senior figures. The loss of existing staff is always a worry in a San Francisco tech company: rivals will offer signing bonuses and options on stock that are likely to grow in value, rather than enduring Twitter’s stock-market rollercoaster.Jack Dorsey, another Twitter co-founder, took over as “interim CEO”, a job that resonates in Silicon Valley because it is the title that Steve Jobs held for a while after he returned to a wounded Apple in 1996. There he ejected the incumbent, shook the company back into shape and eventually took on the title of full CEO.Investors, and 38-year-old Dorsey, would like a repeat. Like Jobs, Dorsey was Twitter’s founding chief executive, but was forced out by Williams in 2008. He returned as executive chairman in 2011, appointed by Costolo, and then took back the reins, so he is not taking over from a standing start. But the board has yet to give him the full-time role.Jack Dorsey: founder and now saviour?Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersThus Dorsey’s appearance on the results conference call last week was in effect an audition for the job. “We need to do three things. One, we need to ensure a more disciplined execution. Two, we need to simplify our services to deliver Twitter’s value faster. And three, we need to better communicate our value,” he said briskly.He also acknowledged that mismatch between fame and usage. “People all over the world know of the power of Twitter, but it’s not clear why they should harness it themselves. An answer to ‘why Twitter?’ must be articulated clearly and felt everywhere throughout the service.”Wall Street liked his attitude, including an undertone of impatience which Costolo lacked. Although it is not obvious to people who are already signed up, joining Twitter is a confusing experience. The blank screen demands you create a username – with your first and second choice probably taken already – and then suggests people for you to “follow”. And then the questions flood in. What does “following” mean? Do you have to be a “friend” like on Facebook?How do you find people? What is the right number of people to follow? What is the right number to be followed by? Why are some people so rude? Fixing that first-time experience is crucial, because there are reckoned to be more than 600 million abandoned Twitter accounts.Jan Dawson, who runs the tech research firm Jackdaw, thinks Dorsey has done a good job so far. “I think what [Wall Street analysts] are reacting to is the true state of Twitter, versus the overly rosy version Dick Costolo had been trying to sell the Street for the past few quarters.” But he notes that user growth still lags, and that “engagement” – how often people who have created an account use it – remains far lower than Facebook’s.You should expect Twitter to show you what’s most meaningful in the world, to live it first, before anyone elseJack DorseyBut Twitter’s advertising revenue is growing strongly, as shown by the 61% rise in quarterly revenue, and Dawson expects another good performance in the next quarter. Nonetheless, Summer thinks a deeper problem remains, underlined by Twitter surveys that show 95% awareness of the company among the public, but an adoption rate of just 30%. “The more likely conclusion is that users (correctly) perceive that Twitter provides little value to them.”According to Dorsey last week, using Twitter should be “as easy as looking out of your window”. He added: “You should expect Twitter to show you what’s most meaningful in the world, to live it first, before anyone else and straight from the source. And you should expect Twitter to keep you informed and updated throughout your day.”But as Anthony Noto, the chief financial officer, admitted on the earnings call: “The number one reason users don’t use Twitter is because they don’t understand why to use Twitter. They don’t understand the value.” if only resolving that problem was as straightforward as a 140-character tweet.
Google has set up its own car company. The tech giant has flirted with major car firms as it explores driverless cars but has also quietly set up its own auto company, according to documents obtained by the Guardian.Google Auto LLC is headed by Chris Urmson, project lead for Google’s self-driving cars. Urmson has been on a charm offensive with the world’s biggest automobile manufacturers. At the North American International Auto Show in January, Urmson announced talks with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Daimler and Volkswagen. In March, he told USA Today: “Making cars is really hard, and the car companies are quite good at it. So, in my mind, the solution is to find a partnership.”To date, no such partnership has emerged. That might be because Google already has its very own car maker in Google Auto. The company is registered with national and international organisations as a passenger vehicle manufacturer, and was licensed last year as a car maker in California. Google declined to comment on this story.Documents obtained by the Guardian under a Public Records Act request in California show that Google Auto was formed as a limited liability company in late 2011. Initially, Google used it to modify and test the fleet of driverless Lexus SUVs that succeeded the company’s first self-driving Prius saloons. Google Auto is named as the manufacturer of all 23 autonomous Lexus cars registered with California’s department of motor vehicles, including all the vehicles involved in a recent spate ofminor accidentsin and around Google’s home town of Mountain View.Related:Crash involving self-driving Google car injures three employeesAlthough no lawsuits have been filed regarding these accidents, it’s common for businesses to set up subsidiaries when trying something new and potentially risky, says Anita Krug, associate professor of law at the University of Washington in Seattle. “When you have a separate entity, you generally have separate liability protection,” she says. “The idea is that if the subsidiary has financial difficulties, creditors should not be able to go after the parent company’s assets.”But as Google’s ambitions for its self-driving technology grew, so did Google Auto’s role. In late May last year, Chris Urmson was appointed manager of Google Auto, taking control of day-to-day operations of the company. The very next day, Google announced that it was going to build 100 prototype self-driving cars from scratch, without steering wheels, accelerator or brake pedals.It was Google Auto LLC that applied for the international vehicle identification number (VIN) codes to identify each new self-driving car, just like any other production vehicle. Google Auto also liaised with America’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and organised emissions testing in California. To avoid onerous safety requirements and crash tests, Google Auto’s cars would be lightweight low speed vehicles (LSVs), capable of a top speed of only 25mph.Paperwork filed by Google Auto with the NHTSA, and seen by the Guardian, indicates that the cars are rear-wheel drive in design, with each wheel having its own braking system. The cars are powered by a modest 20-30kW electric motor from a lithium ion battery. All the cars built so far have been assembled on the outskirts of Detroit, Michigan, by Google’s manufacturing partner, the engineering firm Roush.In correspondence with Mark Rosekind, administrator of the NHTSA, Urmson insisted, “Google Auto LLC has not offered any of its LSVs for sale, and it does not plan to do so.” This is not surprising. With Google so far ahead of other car makers in developing self-driving systems, it would be unlikely to market experimental vehicles packed with cutting-edge technology.However, that does not rule out Google Auto from selling driverless cars direct to the public later on. In fact, says Sebastian Thrun, the computer scientist and engineer who launched Google’s self-driving car project: “The ambition for Google is always to go all the way [from research] to product.”Google has not formed subsidiaries for other hardware projects originating in its secretive Google X division, such as the Google Glass wearable computer. That could be telling, believes Anita Krug. “It could well be the product of Google’s anticipation for the success of the company, that at the get-go they started it with a different company,” she says. “The thought might have been, let’s have a wholly owned subsidiary now and maybe if it does succeed, we can just spin it off into its own company.”Twitter: @meharris
Mark Karpeles, the former head of defunctbitcoinexchange MtGox, has been arrested in Japan, and is reportedly to be questioned over the 2014 disappearance of nearly $390m (£250m) worth of the virtual currency.A spokesman for the Tokyo police said French-born Karpeles, 30, was suspected of accessing the exchange’s computer system in February 2013 and inflating his cash account by $1m.But local media reported that police are also investigating his possible involvement in the vanishing of hundreds of millions of dollars of the virtual currency when the exchange collapsed in 2014. It was not immediately clear if Karpeles was set to be charged with any offences.After the Japanese news websitenikkei.comreported that he was going to be arrested, Karpeles told theWall Street Journalthat the allegations were false and he would “of course deny” them. Kyodo News service quoted Karpeles’s lawyer as saying his client denied any wrongdoing.If found guilty, Karpeles could face up to five years in prison, or a fine of up to 500,000 yen (£2,650).When itfiled for bankruptcyin February 2014, MtGox said 750,000 customer bitcoins and another 100,000 belonging to the exchange were stolen due to a software security flaw.Related:Bitcoin bots bought millions in the last days of Mt GoxKarpeles, who had blamed hackers for the loss, later said he had recovered 200,000 of the lost bitcoins in a “cold wallet” – a storage device such as a memory stick that is not connected to other computers.Known as a self-proclaimed geek who said he was uncomfortable in his native France and hadn’t been back in years, Karpeles became interested in bitcoin when a customer of his web-hosting services wanted to pay in the virtual currency. MtGox subsequently shot from obscurity to dominate global trade in bitcoin, but as early as 2012 employees at the Tokyo-based exchange challenged Karpeles on issues such as whether client money was being used to cover costs.Investors had called on MtGox to publicise its data so that hackers around the world could help analyse what happened. “They say it’s under investigation. That’s all they say,” a French investor told AFP last year at a creditors’ meeting in Tokyo. “They seem to refuse to make public more precise information about MtGox’s own [information] and how and when it was stolen, if it was really stolen.”Karpeles had reportedly refused to travel to the US, where he had been asked to appear for questioning in connection with MtGox’s collapse.
Imagine, 25 years ago, someone telling you: we really need to redress this massive social ignorance that, when you meet someone for the first time, you don’t know everything about them. What we ought to do is assemble a giant database. On everyone.Brilliant idea. But there are a couple of provisos, they add. This database will be sourced from whatever scraps of information are lying around about you – whether carefully crafted, or pulled from the streets. The product of your life’s work; or just some odd thing you once said or did, long ago, somewhere that the database decides to rank highly and eternally.The database will contain the most intimate, embarrassing, destructive things. But they will be mere flecks in a torrent of utility. And because of that: you have no rights or say over the database. Your entry – and that of everyone else who can’t afford a reputation manager – is subject to the whims of the untouchable logic of the machine, scraping the sticky, pocked underbelly of the web.Some would call that idea visionary. Others would call it nuts. But it’s what we’ve got. It’s called a search engine. Or, for most of us, in the monoculture of our digital universe: Google.Forgetting in the database of ruinThe above vision of the “database of ruin” was the opening gambit of Eric Posner, professor of law at the University of Chicago, in a high-profileIQ2 debateearlier this year. He was defending the so-called “right to be forgotten”, attempting to ground its easily misunderstood nature in thedaily lives of ordinary people.Posner’s argument was that some meaningful rights to delist old, irrelevant or incorrect information from monolithic databases are important, in order to give us a small, imperfect measure ofprivacy and dignity. They offer a minor speed bump onasymmetric routes of power, like the one that says you have no rights or say over Google’s presentation of search results.Posner called on his audience to imagine the people at the heart of the database: a 17-year-old boy wrongly arrested for selling drugs; a depressed single mum who files for bankruptcy, giving her a fresh start; a married couple with an acrimonious divorce. Each case involves true events. They are public to some extent, but at the same time private. Not everybody in the world or even outside their area hears about these events. When they move on, privacy law protects these people. Or it did. Before Google.Lowest common denominator netOne of Posner’s opponents was Jonathan Zittrain, another distinguished cyberlaw professor, based at Harvard University. He drove to the other extreme. Even if we might see some merit in Europe’s data laws, Zittrain is not at all happy about them being used to carve holes out of Google search. To counter the database of ruin argument, he says we are creating a “swiss cheese internet”.The nub of Zittrain’s concern is that the practice of shaping what stays and what goes from the database is hopelessly individualistic. By allowing the delisting of information that is incorrect, outdated or harmful for individuals, who knows what else will follow. It sets us on a path, Zittrain claims, where the internet becomes the lowest common denominator result of what all the world’s countries and courts are prepared to leave behind.The only thing stopping Google basically running the world, according to Zittrain, is that even Google doesn’t know what comes up in Google search results.Great. So we’re all going to ruin, but don’t worry, because Google is “dumb”. What a frail hope.World-weary pilgrims make their way to the Greek river of forgetfulness in John Roddam Spencer Stanhope’s ‘The Waters of Lethe’ (1880). Should the internet be more like that forgetful river?Photograph: Don McPhee/Manchester Art GalleryNo clear linesThis issue is in the spotlight, becauseFrance’s data privacy authority has accelerated the demand, first made byEuropean agencies last November, for Google todecouple linksfound to be in breach of European data protection law from individual name searches on Google.com, rather than just Google’s indices that are targeted to Europe – Google.fr, Google.de and so on.The French authority’s justification is that Google’s way of complying with successful delisting requests undermines true protection, by enabling a trivial workaround (though it should be noted that the“friction of the click” in getting to Google.comhas mysteriously and materially increased in the last six months). Google’s enforcement is, in short, passive-aggressive.In a blog-post, Google’s privacy counsel claims“respectful disagreement” with the French, arguing similarly to Zittrain that the French approach would create a “race to the bottom in internet regulation” and is “disproportionate and unnecessary”. The French authority has dismissed the arguments as largely political, not legal. And in fact, when it comes to the law, Google has a massive thorn in its side: intellectual property.Two-tier law: economics v identityGoogle’s argument that “no one country should have the authority to control what content someone in a second country can access” isappealing, but it is also misleading. Currently,US copyright law is relied on to remove contentfrom Google’s global index, no matter where an alleged incident occurs, and at a rate at least three orders of magnitude greater than partial delistings under data privacy laws. The respective rates of approval are 97% for345 million copyright requestsand 41% forone-quarter million privacy requests, in a comparative period.But copyright is not the only murky territory. Trademarks are another. The trademark issue blew up last month, when aCanadian appeal court found that Google was liable to globally delist345 links that were found to be clearly infringing on a Canadian trademark owner’s rights.Google’s “swiss cheese” argument was given short-shrift: “Google raises the spectre of it being subjected to restrictive orders from courts in all parts of the world, each concerned with its own domestic law. The threat of multi-jurisdictional control of Google’s operations is, in my view, overstated,”said Justice Groberman on behalf of the court. “It is the worldwide nature of Google’s business and not any defect in the law that gives rise to that possibility.Courts must consider many factorsand exercise considerable restraint in granting remedies that have international ramifications.”The major restraining factor the Canadian court highlighted was the core value of freedom of expression. “Where there is a realistic possibility that an order with extraterritorial effect may offend another state’s core values, the order should not be made”, it said. Stripping away trademark law’sinherent tensions, it continued: “It has not been suggested that the order prohibiting the defendants from advertising wares that violate intellectual property rights offends the core values of any nation”.You can’t solve the unknownThis line from the Canadian court gets to the heart of our dilemma with local laws and the global internet. The question is whether the right in issue – copyright, trademark, personality, privacy, freedom of expression – has a wide enough territorial scope to justify global relief. And embedded in this are a wide variety of value judgments and difficult questions.Anyone who has an issue with global enforcement of privacy laws must discern why it is that economic rights like copyright and trademarks should be enforced; and personal and privacy rights should not. They must confront the difference between arule-based approach to free speech, which is clear but often unjust; and one which considers the merit of individual cases, and might be more fair, but is less predictable. In addition to this, it is crucial totake right to be forgotten requests out of a black boxand put them intodistinct,identifiable categories.The complex challenges involved in global enforcement of laws demand us to ask what kind of society we want to live in. Are trademark and copyright law really that black and white? Is it appropriate forglobal brands to block sites on the other side of the world, which are neither ambiguous in their origin or misleading to consumers, and may engender creativity and meaning in their own right? Can we balance, with equal force, human rights as much as economic rights?
Windows 10 is under attack over default settings which users say compromise their privacy, just days after the operating system’s successful launch sawmore than 14 million installsin the first 24 hours.Hundreds of commenters on sites such asHacker NewsandReddithave criticised default settings that send personal information to Microsoft, use bandwidth to upload data to other computers running the operating system, share Wi-Fi passwords with online friends and remove the ability to opt out of security updates.Many of the complaints relate to the new personalised adverts embedded in Windows 10. When the OS is installed, Microsoft assigns the user a unique advertising ID, which it ties to the email address registered with the company. That email address is also associated with a raft of other services, such as the company’s productivity and communication programs, as well as app downloads and cloud-storage uploads.Using that information, Microsoft is able to personalise ads to the user, during both web surfing and, for newer apps downloaded from the Windows Store, app usage. Microsoft itself is leading the way on that front, even turning the in-built version of Solitaire (the card game that has been a staple of Windows installations since 1990’s Windows 3.0) into a freemium game, complete with unskippable video adverts.Elsewhere, Windows 10 also harvests user information in order to teach the built-in personal digital assistantCortana, Microsoft’s answer to Siri. To enable Cortana, the company says, it “collects and uses various types of data, such as your device location, data from your calendar, the apps you use, data from your emails and text messages, who you call, your contacts and how often you interact with them on your device”.Related:Windows 10 review – final version of Windows might be Microsoft's best everUsers are given the option to opt out of most of the data collection, but critics say that that isn’t enough. Alec Meer, of gaming website Rock Paper Shotgun,says: “Microsoft simply aren’t making it clear enough that they’re doing this, how it might affect you and how to opt out – despite chest-thumping, we’re-all-chums-here talk about how ‘real transparency starts with straightforward terms and policies that people can clearly understand’.“There is no world in which 45 pages of policy documents and opt-out settings split across 13 different Settings screens and an external website constitutes ‘real transparency’.”Others have criticised the company for a seeming get-out clause in its terms of service, which allow it to share user data based on nothing more than a “good faith” belief that doing so is required to comply with law enforcement, “protect our customers”, secure the company’s services, or “protect the rights or property of Microsoft”.The terms are reminiscent of those applied by the company in March 2014, when it read the hotmail account of a blogger suspected of being involved in leaking an early version of Windows 10. After facing criticism for doing so,Microsoft tightened its privacy policy, and promised a full internal legal review before it would do so again in the future.The European digital rights organisation (EDRi) sums up the company’s 45 pages of terms and conditionsby saying: “Microsoft basically grants itself very broad rights to collect everything you do, say and write with and on your devices in order to sell more targeted advertising or to sell your data to third parties.”In many ways, however, Windows 10 is merely moving closer towards what has become the new normal thanks to mobile operating systems. Both Siri and Google Now require access to the user’s personal information to personalise responses, while both Apple and Google offer developers the ability to deliver personalised ads to users based on information such as app installs.And some of the criticised settings may turn out to be a net positive for all concerned. Users have attacked Windows 10 for only offering two settings when it comes to Windows Update: either install and restart immediately, or install and ask permission to restart. The option to not install updates does not appear to be present on the base version of the OS. But that decision chimes withthe advice of security experts, who say that the number one thing for staying safe online is to install every security update immediately.Windows 10: it launched so quietly you may have missed it
I can seriously see the point of the Skoda Fabia. I can’t stand the convention that, as soon as you have a family, you have to start driving some lumbering bison of a car, destined to stick out in car parks and squeeze down urban roads. I would much rather drive something that looked like a hot hatch and just happened to have a bunch of people and animals in the back.OK, the Fabia does not look like a hot hatch. It doesn’t look hot. It looks like your existing girlfriend. No, just kidding! That kind of sexist objectification has no place in car reviewing. It looks dependable and friendly, but not particularly invigorating. I’m not sure that it would wow the younger audience, but then I always think the young car buyer who has money is a figment of the industry’s imagination.The interior styling feels a bit hire car: it’s pretty anonymous, and the cabin is comfortable but not especially inviting, and there are no luxurious touches. The most impressive thing is that it’s small, but doesn’t feel small. Most of the space has been saved from the boot, which nevertheless remains large enough for normal boot activity, until you try to add a proper-sized dog. I think it’s a no-pets car.Apart from daintiness, the main thing to recommend it is the economy. The 1.2l petrol engine (there’s a one-litre model, and a diesel) delivers 60.1mpg on the combined cycle, which is impressive. It is not what you’d call nippy. Third gear really runs out of puff, and second is very short; I was constantly surprised by how much changing down I’d have to do mid-manoeuvre. This makes it not huge fun to drive, although the handling is fine and on a motorway it tootles along with something like enthusiasm. It helps that it’s quiet: the external noise is minimal and nothing rattles. It can be bumpy on rough surfaces, but it never said it was a tank.I can’t vouch personally for its safety features, having never even skimmed another vehicle in it, but it scored five stars in theEuro NCAP safety ratingslast year, most likely down to the six airbags and the Isofix child seat fittings.Look, it didn’t set my world on fire. It probably thinks setting things on fire is irresponsible. If it were a person, it would eat sensibly, go to the gym a lot (or maybe powerwalk), probably not do triathlons. You’d want to live next door to someone like this – her hedges would be neat and she would recycle.

He has more than two million facebook fans, which is just under half what theGuardianhas (we’re not jealous).He likes “cuddling and herding things”, according to his profile.

Google has quietly resurrected its wearable computer, Glass, as an enterprise-focused device aimed at industries such as healthcare, manufacturing and energy.The unannounced relaunch,reported by the Wall Street Journal, could be followed a year later by a new consumer version. But for now, the device is aimed exclusively at business customers who gain immediate value from having a head-mounted display, and bypass many of the issues experienced by consumer users, particularly the privacy concerns sparked by wearing a head-mounted camera in public places.The relaunch comes just six months after Google announced that the device wouldcease production“in present form”. That announcement saw Google moving the team out of its future-tech X division and into a whole separate division headed by the man behind the iPod,Tony Fadell.The move was announced by Google as a “graduation”, but many instead saw it as a mercy killing for the device as it existed, after lacklustre consumer response and ever-present privacy issues soured the idea in the eyes of the public – notoriously leading to the coinage “glasshole” to describe a certain type of Google Glass wearer.The initial release of Glass was designed to explore just these issues. Sold as part of an “explorer” programme, initially for $1,500 a pair, the company was adamant that users weren’t buying a finished consumer product. But from the off, it promoted Glass widely,dressing catwalk models in the technologyand eventually cutting the price to $500.While the consumer preview was mildly unsuccessful, it did reveal to the company the potential of using the devices in specific institutional contexts. Most notably,the device was adopted by surgeons, for whom the offer of a voice-controlled, hands-free screen holds obvious benefits.Sony aims to outdo Google Glass with SmartEyeglass smart glassesGoogle Glass can return – but it must clear four big hurdles first
Gaming has its trends, and in recent times one has been the procedurally generated or “roguelike” indie game. You could go back over decades picking out examples of this design technique, but the big inspiration for this modern flowering is the success of Spelunky. A 2D platformer that married Nintendo-quality controls with brilliant enemies and ever-changing environments, it’s not only a classic but shows why the technique is so attractive to small teams. A procedurally generated game can, if you get it right, keep surprising players for years and even decades to come.The Swindle is firmly in this lineage, a treasure-focused platformer with an emphasis on stealth and an overarching structure that gives each individual “run” its own importance. Playing as a succession of thieves in a world of steampunk Victoriana, your goal is to filch enough cash to upgrade your thieves’ capabilities, access new areas, and steal a new crime-busting invention from Scotland Yard before 100 days are up. Each heist takes one day, and if you die then that’s that – the cash is lost, the day is wasted, and you move on to the next thief (they have great names: a particular favourite was the short-lived Pleasant Undercarriage.)The best thing about The Swindle, around which everything pivots, is the tension between greed and safety. Anything will kill you in one hit and so every day’s level is an exercise in seeing just how far you can push your luck – when you have enough cash to get your next upgrade, but are looking at a heavily-defended room with a cash-stuffed computer inside, it’s a real decision. Personally I’m a YOLO kind of thief, which is why I have an achievement for dying while in possession of 100% of a level’s money.Your cash is used to buy upgrades like double-jumps, the ability to hack more effectively, bombs, vision-obscuring steam, and so on. By the latter stages you’re able to take over robots, teleport through walls, stick to any surface, remotely disable security systems, and all manner of other tricks – a far cry from your lowly hopping origins.The upgrades go hand-in-hand with the larger structure, that drive to rob richer locations and steal the ultimate prize before time runs out. Unfortunately, there are major reasons why this didn’t work for me. The biggest is that roguelikes depend on experimentation and discovery through death. The Swindle clearly believes this too, because it gives a new player absolutely no concessions – you’re thrown in without a tutorial or any explanation of how it works, and the only way to find out is to try things. This is why death, in a good roguelike, is the core of the experience – every time, you come back stronger.In The Swindle’s case, however, the structure makes death purely punitive – not only do you lose a day, but also that character’s XP bonus (the longer they live, the more cash you can heist.) And when you finally start to get a real handle on the game, you’ve got (in my case) 30 days left on that save file. So your reward for finally starting to progress is to go back to the start where, theoretically, you should be much more efficient and race back through.To put this in a nutshell, Spelunky is a skill game: you may end up with lots of fancy gadgets, but you don’tneedthem to progress, or for simply playing it to feel good. The Swindle is not about skill, but about how upgraded your character is. This is really driven home when you reset to day one for the first time, lose all upgrades, and it’s absolutely awful. Your new game’s character feels pathetically underpowered, because they are, and you’re faced with grinding through the first worlds again multiple times in order to sloooowly get your skills back. The idea of giving a roguelike a more long-term structure is a good one, but The Swindle’s execution doesn’t work for me at all.Over time you also notice issues with The Swindle’s procedural generation. The game doesn’t have the subtlety to know how upgraded the player is, so instead relies on drawing stark divisions between the locations which depend on your owning certain upgrades. If you haven’t got them? Tough. The warehouse district is an early culprit, sometimes offering up buildings that simply cannot be accessed without certain upgrades – so you have to write off a day.This problem infects other areas, because it means the upgrades are priced in severe increments that make it clear which one you should buy next. Which invites the question – why let the player have the choice at all? Without the upgrade system as it is, the cash wouldn’t be important, and without that the game wouldn’t work at all – so a tangle of priorities results in a system that occasionally fails its players.Sadly it gets worse. The game’s internal logic seems arbitrary: why can enemies swing their cosh through windows, but you can’t do the same without knocking out the glass first? Why does a particular robot stop at edges every time, but one time in a hundred will fall off? Why will an exploding mine sometimes leave the same robot alive and sometimes kill it?These oddities are married to technical failings. The suspect collision detection leads to enemies sometimes passing through the visual sweep of your cosh unharmed, intended blows next to smashed windows will instead ‘tap’ the pane above your head, and so on. Then there are outright bugs: a few times my thief has fallen on spikes (normally instant death) and landed safely in them. Hacking a mine next to an open door will see your character simultaneously close the door, while opening doors through the security system still leaves them hackable – a nightmare if a mine’s nearby, because the door’s prompt will take priority over the mine. Such things may happen rarely but, in a precision game where you’re planning moves in advance, to die when the game doesn’t behave ‘properly’ is almost unforgivably frustrating.Precision is a particular problem with The Swindle’s controls, which by default feel sluggish. You can tweak the deadzone (ie how sensitive the analogue stick is) but it can only be increased from the default value. Add this to the miniscule delay between pressing jump and your character jumping, and it’s enough to drive any control freak crazy. This is a precision platformer where the controls at key moments lack precision, and in the hands that is just as infuriating as it sounds.Everything adds up to a game with good ideas that is sorely lacking in refinement – the punitive flaws of The Swindle’s meta-structure and procedural generation could have been ameliorated with minor tweaks. This feels 80% of the way to a great game, but that missing 20% soon comes to dominate the rest. With a little more fine-tuning who knows how The Swindle may have turned out but, as things stand, it feels a little like being short-changed.
Women are woefullyunder-representedin the tech industry. Astudy last yearfound that of 6,517 companies that had raised venture funding in the US only 183 had a female chief executive. Now one of those is setting out a simple, practical idea that might actually move the dial.Launched this week bySandi MacPherson, founder of the San Francisco-based social networking startupQuibb, the50/50 Pledgeaims to get an equal proportion of men and women on stage at tech events by connecting organisers with a directory of relevant female experts. Since the directory was tweeted out by MacPherson “with no expectations” in May it has already accrued over 1,100 names, with candidates ranging from software engineers to chief marketing officers at companies such as Google, Facebook and BuzzFeed.Sandi MacPherson of Quibb: ‘When you give someone an audience and a stage and a microphone, that person is determined to be reputable simply by occupying that space and by being given that authority to speak.’Photograph: YouTube“To me it was a practical rather than a philosophical problem,” MacPherson explains. “What little piece can I break off that might have a big effect? When you give someone an audience and a stage and a microphone, that person is determined to be reputable simply by occupying that space and by being given that authority to speak. I recognised the inherent leverage that comes with getting a woman into that position.”This is part of what needs to happen for us to have a more diverse, relevant and skilled tech workforce in the UKDr Sue BlackTechmums founder Dr Sue Black, who only two weeks agowrote abouther own frustration with the all-too-frequent all-male rosters at UK tech events, welcomes the pledge and hopes it extends beyond the US. “It is a great idea. We have so many amazing and forward-thinking people in the UK tech industry, it would be great if we could take a lead and show everyone how diversity brings massive strength. I can’t see change happening unless we have quotas of some sort.”But is the aim of 50% realistic, considering that McPhersonhas calculatedthat only 25% of speakers at Silicon Valley events are currently women? She reports that only one of the event organisers she spoke to backed out after hearing the figure, citing it as “too hard”; interestingly, the dissenter was herself female.When asked the same question, Black retorts: “I don’t know and frankly I don’t care. This is part of what needs to happen for us to have a more diverse, relevant and skilled tech workforce in the UK. We need to compete in what is now a global marketplace and we can’t do that if we have a ridiculously old-fashioned outlook.”MacPherson is also quick to rebut accusations of tokenism. “I’ve met with hundreds of women who are at the top of their game in terms of their niche and their role. The issue is not that these women don’t exist or that we’ll end up with people on the stage who shouldn’t be there, it’s literally just that the connection [between event organisers and speakers] isn’t there.”She emphasises that blame for the problem lies with outdated processes rather than some secret cabal of misogynists. “Some of the event organisers I spoke to actually already had 50% as an internal goal. They were trying really hard to hit that, but they were looking to their own networks, or asking existing speakers to recommend others, and that is generally men speaking to men. It is true that when you’re in the Bay area the networks are really tight, and they didn’t have easy tools to help them look beyond that.”Related:Silicon Valley is cool and powerful. But where are the women?TED Media, which hasattracted criticismfor the gender imbalance of its famous Talks, would seem an obvious early candidate for the pledge, but MacPherson is more interested in gaining traction within mid-size industry-insider gatherings. “I’m focusing on events which practitioners who actually work in those spaces perceive as being valuable. I think that’s where there can be most impact, where women are talking about what they actually do and showing they are equal to their male counterparts.”In the future, she admits, she needs to find a way for the project to scale. She also suspects that there bigger issues at stake; she has been talking to Geekettes founder Jess Erickson, who organises all-female hackathons in Berlin, about the likelihood that the design of “events made by men, for men” will require a thoroughgoing overhaul if they are to become more compelling to both women speakers and attendees.For now, however, she’s remaining pragmatic. “I’m taking a very startup approach. There’s a two-sided marketplace, there’s supply and demand, and there seems to be interest on both sides. I just need to understand how I can bring them together.”
Sometimes, when it comes to internet trolls, the best thing to do is grab a slice of cake.At least that’s what one sewing blogger’s followers decided after an internet troll came out of nowhere to tell her she should “eat less cake”.Jenny Rushmore, who blogs underCashmerette, regularly shares her sewing plans and projects on her Instagram page – including her plans to make a swimsuit.In a now-deleted comment, the man commented on her Instagram post, telling her she should “eat less cake”.“It was on a picture of my curvy sketchbook where I’d drawn a pic of a swimsuit I was going to make and hashtagged it “#beachbodyready,” she told the Guardian.“He said something along the lines of ‘ugh, you don’t have a beach body. You should eat less cake’.”In response, Rushmore posted another picture with a defiant message for the troll.“To the random jerk who fat-shamed me this morning in a comment and suggested I eat less cake: as you can see form this pic my life is just a sad mess, so I’m glad you’ve helped steer my dietary choices, cheers! #effyourbeautystandards #CakeWithCashmerette”In response, other sewing bloggers and Cashmerette readers began sharing photos of them eating cake on Instagram, using the hashtag#CakewithCashmerette.Rushmore said she was “overwhelmed” by the response. “I think body-shaming hits a nerve with a lot of women, and increasingly people want to fight back,” she added.“And what better and tastier way to fight back than with cake?”Writing on her blogabout the reaction, Rushmore said:Even if you *could* tell someone’s health and eating habits from looking at them, so what? My health is mine. It doesn’t affect anyone else. I’m not obliged to disclose my medical records to any random person who expressed fake concern about my health based on my appearance. And nor do I exist to be sexually appealing to you.Jenny Rushmore blogs about the things she sews on Cashmerette.Photograph: Jenny Rushmore/CashmeretteRushmore founded theCurvy Sewing Collective, a plus-size sewing community, and hasalso created a line of diversified and personalised fashion sketchbooks aimed at curvy women.She said: “I’m pretty lucky that I only get comments like this occasionally but I have many curvy blogger friends who have this happen all the time, either publicly or by email, so I hear about it very frequently.”And she says the sewing blogger community is generally very body positive. “When you sew you learn that you can be stylish at any size, and that you don’t have to change your body to fit clothes, you simply have to make clothes that fit. Sewing has changed my body image in profound ways, and I hope that more curvy women can have the same experience.”More and more women have been fighting back against fat-shaming online. Tess Holliday,the world’s first size 26 model, started the hashtag#EffYourBeautyStandardson Instagram to challenge traditional views of beauty in the media.
Hello, it’s Friday. Today’s game is Arslan: the Warriors of Legend, a tactical action game from Tecmo Koei, coming to PS4 and Xbox One in early 2016.
Telecoms lobbyists have filed a brief ina lawsuit that includes nearly every major industry playerdemanding that the Washington DC court of appeals vacate net neutrality rules ordered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in February.Chief among the objections of the United Telecom Association (UTA) is that their members won’t invest as heavily in broadband infrastructure if they are forced to abide by the new regulations, contravening the FCC’s mandate to encourage investment.One of the plaintiffs in the joint brief, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, said in a blogpost on Thursday that it had always supported “reasonable” net neutrality. The FCCreclassified internet providers under Title II of the Communications Act, making them common carriers subject to the same regulations as public utilities.“Unfortunately,” the NCTA said, “the FCC went well beyond that sensible mission and chose to impose an outdated, far-reaching and punitive regulatory model on today’s dynamic Internet.”The net neutrality rule is “arbitrary and capricious”, according to the UTA’s brief. “Worse, the Order willfully disregards the destructive effects of reclassification on hundreds of billions of dollars in investment-backed reliance interests that the FCC’s prior light-touch approach deliberately induced,” UTA lawyers wrote.This is in contrast to statements by Fran Shammo, CFO of Verizon, which has some 9.2 million US subscribers, ata UBS Bank telecoms industry conferencein December 2014. “To be real clear, this does not influence the way we invest,” he said in answer to a question about the coming change to Title II regulation.“I mean we’re going to continue to invest in our networks and our platforms, both in wireless and wireline FiOS and where we need to. So nothing will influence that. I mean, if you think about it – look, I mean we were born out of a highly regulated company, so we know how this operates.” (Shammo also added that the regulations would result in “a very litigious environment”.)The NCTA said its own record on net neutrality as a concept was solid. “Cable providers have invested billions of dollars into building, maintaining, and improving an open Internet experience for our customers,” the organization’s statement said. “And even without formal net neutrality rules on the books, our industry embraced core Open Internet principles since they were first floated in the 1990s – and we continue to live by those principles today.”Evan Greer, campaign director of internet activist group Fight for the Future, disagreed with that assessment. “I think it’s outrageous for companies that have spent tens of millions of dollars trying to undermine the public will on this issue claim that they’ve always supported net neutrailty,” she said. “In recent years they’ve used it as a buzzword, but they’ve always pushed for policies that allow for a two-tiered internet that allows for fast lanes. That is the opposite of net neutrality.”
A US-listed car parts maker is paying £1.1bn to buy HellermannTyton, a British manufacturer of cable equipment, as it seeks to capitalise on the growing trend in intelligent vehicles.Delphi Automotive said it expects HellermannTyton, which makes products for fastening, fixing, and protecting cables, to help it take advantage of increasing demand for vehicles that connect to the web and smart devices such as phones and tablets.Delphi said it would pay 480p in cash for each Hellermann share. The price is 44% more than Hellermann’s closing share price on Wednesday. Hellermann’s shares rose 42% to 472p.Delphi is based in Gillingham, Kent, but its shares are listed in New York. It makes electronic components for motor vehicles, including safety systems that detect hazards, and employs more than 20,000 people.Hellermann, based in Manchester, employs 3,800 people globally. In the UK it employs 700 people and its main factories are in Manchester and Plymouth.Delphi said it expected to save $50m (£32m) a year by the end of 2018 by cutting purchasing costs and making its supply chain more efficient. It said that after the deal was completed it would review overlapping operations, including Hellermann’s distribution network.Delphi said the deal would give it more products to capitalise on the “megatrend” for connected cars and opportunities to expand in Hellermann’s other sectors such as aerospace and defence.New safety and anti-pollution rules are forcing cars to become more intelligent so engines are fuel efficient and vehicles can better perform semi-automated taskssuch as accident avoidance and cruise control. Cars increasingly rely on multiple computer systems to operate and become safer by responding to what is around them. The move towards intelligent cars is expected to lead tovehicles that drive themselves more safelythen human beings.The deal is the latest in a spate of mergers and acquisitions as companies seek new markets and products to spur growth. Takeovers worth $5bn or more totalled a record $1.13tn in the first half of this year, fuelled by a boom in the US.Apart from Shell’s blockbuster £47bn acquisition of BG Group, merger activity in the UK has been more muted. Also on Thursday, Chime Communications, a sports marketing company, said it was in talks to sell itself for almost £350m to WPP, the world’s biggest advertising company, and US buyout firm Providence Equity Partners.Kevin Clark, Delphi’s chief executive, said: “With consumers now demanding more connectivity in their vehicles, electrical architecture is the enabler to that added vehicle content. By leveraging the combined capabilities of both companies, we will be able to capitalise on additional growth opportunities and create significant value for our customers and shareholders.”
The most powerful African American politicians in the US will next week demand that Silicon Valley companies hire more black people after official figures revealed that many of the world’s most prominent tech companies’ workforces are just 2% black.GK Butterfield, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), will meet with executives at Apple and Google in Silicon Valley on Monday and Tuesday to tell them to “implement a diversity plan that will place more African Americans in the tech pipeline”.Butterfield, who will be joined by all members of the CBC Diversity Task Force, has described diversity at Silicon Valley companies track records on diversity as “appalling” and their bosses as “not inclusive”.The taskforce will meet with executives at Apple, Google, Bloomberg, Intel, Kapor, Pandora and SAP – but not Facebook, Twitter or Yahoo, companies with the lowest proportion of black employees.African Americans representless than 1.5% of Facebook’s 5,479 US employees.Mark Zuckerberg’s company hired 36 black employees last year out of a total headcount increase of 1,216.In 2013, Facebook hired just seven additional black people,including just one black woman.Twitter employsjust 49 black people out of a total US workforce of 2,910.The tiny number of African American staff – 35 men and 14 women – represents just 1.7% of Twitter’s US staff.Yahoo and Google US employeesare also just 2% black.Apple fares betterwith African Americans making up 7% of its workforce.African Americans account for 13.6% of the US population, according to the 2010 US census.Spokespeople for Twitter and Facebook did not explain why executives from the companies are not meeting with the CBC task force next week. However, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, did recently meet with Butterfield in Washington DC. She also wrotea blogpostsaying the company would do more to address “unconscious bias” against black people.Butterfield said: “Our goal for this trip is to encourage and partner with these organizations to implement a diversity plan that will place more African Americans in the tech pipeline. This will potentially lead to a wide range of opportunities, from student internships to positions on the boards of tech companies. Building a coalition of leaders from the public and private sectors ensures greater diversity and full representation of African Americans at every level of tech by 2020.”He has previously said: “Many of the technology companies have African Americans as very loyal customers, and many of those don’t have any African Americans on their boards. Their senior leadership within many of these companies is not inclusive, and the workforce is appalling. And their reinvestment in African American communities is less than desirable.”
Google has rejected the French data protection authority’s demand that it censor search results worldwide in order to comply with the European Court of Justice’s so-called right to be forgotten ruling.The company’s rejection of the ruling could see its French subsidiary facing daily fines, although no explicit sanction has yet been declared.The ruling,made in May 2014, requires the search engine to remove links to pages that “appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive … in the light of the time that had elapsed”. Even accurate data that has been lawfully published initially can, the court said, “in the course of time become incompatible with the directive”.Google grudgingly acquiesced to the ruling, which was based on a case brought by a Spanish man who wanted to remove an auction notice of his repossessed home dating from 1998, and started to take requests from the public for links to be removed from European domains soon after.As of March 2015, the company had received nearly 220,000 requests to remove links to online information, including many high-profile requests from criminals, politicians and public figures, and slightly less than half of the request have been granted. But figuresobtained by the Guardianshow that more than 95% of the requests come from everyday members of the public.In September 2014,a Parisian court went a step furtherthan the original ruling and ordered Google to remove links from its entire global network if they violate the right to be forgotten. In November 2014, it threatened the company with daily €1,000 fines if it didn’t comply.Then, in June 2015, the French national data protection authority, CNIL, stepped in andmade the same demand, ordering Google to apply delisting on all versions of its search engine. The authority’s rationale is that removing links just from the French, or even European, versions of Google’s websites does not sufficiently protect the right to be forgotten, since readers can still go to Google.com, the company’s American site, and find unexpurgated results. This works even within European countries.CNIL said that“in accordance with the CJEU (European court of justice) judgement, the CNIL considers that in order to be effective, delisting must be carried out on all extensions of the search engine and that the service provided by Google search constitutes a single processing”.The company was given 15 days to comply, but Google has today said it will not be doing so. A spokesperson said: “We’ve worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten ruling thoughtfully and comprehensively in Europe, and we’ll continue to do so. But as a matter of principle, we respectfully disagree with the idea that a national data protection authority can assert global authority to control the content that people can access around the world.”In a blogpost, Peter Fleischer, Google’s Global Privacy Counsel, said: “We believe this order is disproportionate and unnecessary, given that the overwhelming majority of French internet users – currently around 97% – access a European version of Google’s search engine likegoogle.fr, rather than Google.com or any other version of Google.”Additionally, Fleischer added, the company is concerned that complying with the French courts could potentially set a precedent that one country’s laws can control access to content globally. “There are innumerable examples around the world where content that is declared illegal under the laws of one country, would be deemed legal in others: Thailand criminalises some speech that is critical of its King, Turkey criminalises some speech that is critical of Ataturk, and Russia outlaws some speech that is deemed to be ‘gay propaganda’.“If the CNIL’s proposed approach were to be embraced as the standard for internet regulation, we would find ourselves in a race to the bottom. In the end, the internet would only be as free as the world’s least free place.”Google’s difficulties are just the latest example of a major web firm struggling to deal with the practicalities of offering the same service across a number of different nations. Facebook has been sparring with European data protection authorities for several years over whether it is sufficient to comply by the rules of Ireland, where its European subsidiary is based, or if it has to abide by every individual European nation’s regulations.Most recently,Facebook was ordered by a German regulator to relax its real-name policy. Directly addressing the issue of jurisdiction, the German regulator told the firm “if you like our game, you must play by our rules”.
An open letter from AI researchers urging a ban on offensive autonomous weapons has now reached 16,000 signatories, after being signed by more than 15,000 people in the three days since it was released.The letter says“AI technology has reached a point where the deployment of [autonomous weapons] is – practically if not legally – feasible within years” and wasinitially signed byTesla’s Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Google DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis and professor Stephen Hawking. It has now been signed by over 2,000 experts, as well as another 14,000 individuals from outside the AI community.It warns: “The stakes are high: autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms … The endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow. The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from starting.”The letter was launched in Buenos Aires earlier this week, and Toby Walsh, one of the researchers involved in putting it together, says that the momentum behind it has gathered entirely through word of mouth. But despite the huge support, Walsh emphasised that the position is by no means universal amongst the AI community. “These issues are not black and white. There are arguments for both sides here. It’s just my opinion, and that of thousands of my colleagues, that the balance of arguments favours a ban before we end up in this next arms race.”In fact, Walsh concedes that “there are several arguments against a ban”. He says: “For instance, such robots will be more precise and able to minimise civilian casualties. Another is that we should not risk human lives when robots can take their place. However, I find these carry less weight than the fear of an arms race and of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorist and other organisations.”But he argues that the impetus for a ban is not merely hypothetical, and that there are robots available today “that have the capabilities needed to build such autonomous weapons”.“One such example (there are others) is the Google autonomous car: it can be given a high level goal (‘take me to the office’), make a plan for how to achieve that goal, sense where it is using computer vision and radar, start executing that plan, identify when the plan breaks (perhaps there are roadworks), find a new plan and start executing that, take evasive action when a car cuts them in, and finally identify when it has reached some goal.“These are essentially the capabilities you need to build an autonomous weapon system that can find, locate, track and target. Of course, terrorists don’t have the means or capabilities today to build a Google-like car. But it won’t be long before the technology is smaller, cheaper and better. That’s always the case with computing. the killer robots that I fear most are small ones. Imagine swarms of tens or hundreds of robots. It would be hard to defend against such an opponent. And small robots will be cheap and easy to replicate.”Of course, even if AIs don’t get the explicit go-ahead to murder, that doesn’t mean that there won’t be ethical challenges ahead. “We must not forget the many other challenging and important ethical decisions in AI,” says Walsh. “To go back to the autonomous cars, what happens when such a car needs to make a life or death decision when facing a car coming towards it on the wrong side of the road?”At a UN conference in Geneva in April discussing the future of weaponry, including so-called killer robots,the UK opposed a banon the development of autonomous weapons, despite calls from various pressure groups, including the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots.
Uber has denied claims its application misleads users by displaying “phantom cars” which don’t actually exist.The claim was made by Alex Rosenblat and Luke Stark, a pair of researchers from the Data &amp; Society thinktank. Inan article for Vice’s Motherboard, Rosenblat wrote that the phantom cars are just one way that Uber’s passenger app can be “deceptive”.Rosenblat and Stark cited driver and passenger testimonies which suggested that the app shows cars present in the passengers’ vicinity even when none are there. They also cited an Uber customer-support representative who apparently told a passenger that the app “is simply showing that there are partners on the road at the time”.“This is not a representation of the exact numbers of drivers or their location,” the representative allegedly continued. “This is more of a visual effect, letting people know that partners are searching for fares. I know this seems a misleading to you but it is meant as more of a visual effect more than an accurate location of drivers in the area. It would be better of you to think of this as a screen saver on a computer.”But Uber UK says that the cars are real, if occasionally lagging behind real time.“Our goal is for the number of cars and their location to be as accurate as possible in real time,” a spokesperson told the Guardian. “Latency is one reason this is not always possible. Another reason is that the app only shows the nearest eight cars to avoid cluttering the screen. Also, to protect the safety of drivers, in some volatile situations, the app doesn’t show the specific location of individual cars until the ride is requested.”Uber has not commented on other allegations in Rosenblat’s piece, including that claim that surge pricing – the company’s controversial practice of increasing the fare during times of high demand – is also based on illusory circumstances.She writes: “While surge pricing is represented as a reflection of the marketplace, our research suggests that Uber’s algorithms are also predictive: they forecast supply and demand so that drivers can be pre-positioned to meet predicted demand, but they don’t always reflect an accurate picture in real time.”As a result, drivers tell stories of being encouraged to drive to an area by surge pricing, only to find that there are no customers there.Rosenblat and Stark’s claims are based on a forthcoming paper from Data &amp; Society.
Can a thumb PC or mini-desktop replace my seven-year-old Windows XP PC? Or, as desktops are on the way out, could I get away with using an iPad and iPhone? Basically, I do email, social media, web-surfing and photos.Suman NayyarAt this early stage, I wouldn’t recommend a “USB PC” such as theIntel Compute Stickas a desktop replacement: a mini-desktop such as theAcer Revo Oneis more capable and much better value. The larger question is whether you can replace a PC with a tablet.The first answer is that it depends what you want to do. Some people need a PC (or Mac or whatever), while others are perfectly happy using a tablet, phablet or smartphone. The second answer is that you can have both. Today, you can buy tablets that run Microsoft Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, and there are lots of convertibles that work as laptops and as tablets.In sticking with Windows XP, you may have missed 14 years of progress. PCs no longer take from 30 seconds to three minutes to start up; you can switch them on and off just like tablets. Thanks to the UEFI system and chip-based drives, a good Windows 8.1 laptop can now boot in 10 seconds, and wake up in about two seconds.Tablets used to be handier than PCs, but they’re not much different now.Desktop v laptopOne advantage of a desktop PC is that you will generally get a full-sized keyboard and screen, typically 22in or 24in. This is better for your productivity, and your health. (Hunching over a laptop or tablet is bad for your spine.) Desktops are also easier to expand and repair, and most have DVD or Blu-ray drives built in.However, mini-desktops and all-in-one PCs have the same problem as laptops (packing hot chips into confined spaces) and therefore tend to have similar specifications. The one area where you usually win is storage space. For example, the £199.99 Acer Revo One has a terabyte drive where a £200 laptop might have a 32GB eMMC flash memory chip.The main drawback with desktops is that they take up space. Laptops are, obviously, mobile, and can be stowed away when not in use.But in principle, desktops and laptops can run the same software, including sophisticated programs such as Adobe PhotoShop and Lightroom. Cheap laptops will be less powerful but should be fine for your purposes (email, social media, web-surfing and photos). For some suggestions, see a recent Ask Jack column,Can you help me choose a cheap laptop?Laptops, tablets and convertiblesIn general, laptops and desktops are used for productive and creative work while tablets and phablets are used for media consumption and casual gaming. Yes, this is an oversimplification, and there’s a big overlap. None the less, PCs really are better for tasks where you need a keyboard and the ability to move files around – which may include photo editing and batch processing.This is where convertibles come in. These are (mostly) Windows PCs where you can detach the screen and use it as a standalone tablet, or rotate the screen to form a thick “tablet” with the keyboard underneath. This gives you a bit of the best of both worlds. For example, you can use a convertible as a laptop for sorting and editing photos in programs like Lightroom, and for batch processing and uploading them to Flickr etc. Then you can switch to a tablet app to view them, using your fingers to flick between images.Windows Store tablet apps are just as easy to install, update and remove as the ones in the Apple and Google stores. The drawbacks? There aren’t as many Windows apps, and the Apple iOS apps tend to be much higher quality. However, if there isn’t a Windows app for something, you can always run a full-spec browser and hit the web.So, think about what you do on Windows XP and you do on your Apple iPhone. Could you do the XP-type things on a smartphone if it had a 10in screen? If not, would you be give up some of the PC’s power and convenience in exchange for access to the wealth of iOS or Android tablet apps? Your money, your choice.Cost and convenienceAs you already use an iPhone, I assume you will end up choosing between an iPad and a Windows 8.1 convertible, which you can upgrade to Windows 10.The iPad option is, as you know, relatively expensive, though iPads do retain some resale value.Pricesrange from £239 for an iPad Mini 2 with a 7.9in screen and 16GB of storage to £599 for a much faster iPad Air 2 with a 9.7in screen and 128GB of memory. All the screens have the same resolution. In the long term, I don’t think 16GB is enough storage, but you could get, say, a 64GB Mini 3 for £399 or a 64GB iPad Air 2 for £479.You may also need some accessories, such as a USB connector (£15), Camera Connection Kit (£25), iPad Smart Case (£39) and an Apple Wireless Keyboard (£59) – all these are from the Apple Store. You can find cheaper alternatives on Amazon etc, but you could still end up spending £50 to £100 on top of the cost of the iPad.You will not be shocked to hear that you can get Windows tablets and convertibles for far less, with 8in tablets starting at under £100 and 10.1in 2-in-1s with keyboards at under £200. In addition to the ones I suggestedbefore, you could also consider theLenovo Miix 3(£179.99),Asus Transformer Book T100TAF(£199.95) and the better-madeT100 Chi(£349.99). Storage is not a problem if you can slot in a cheap Samsung 32GB or 64GB SD card (roughly £10 to £20).All these machines have keyboards and USB ports, so you don’t need any extra accessories: you get one convenient package.But if I were you, I’d spend £200 to £250 on anAcer Revo Oneor similar drop-in replacement, see how you get on with Windows 10, and leave the tablet decision for later. iPad sales are in decline, and the Apple blogs are speculating about the launch of an iPad Mini 4, an iPad Air 3, and perhaps a 12in iPad Pro in the next three or four months. If you end up using an iPad and iPhone, the Revo One will still be a great media server.Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com
We have such a fraught relationship with summer in Britain. Most of the time, the sun skulks behind cloud cover, only briefly surfacing to give us false hope on the first day of Wimbledon. Its fleeting visits are met with near orgiastic excitement as even we grown adults flock to ice cream vans or hastily erect rusting barbecues so that we can give all our neighbours botulism. No sunny day can be taken for granted, so the result is stress and resentment. You don’twantto put a bikini on and frolic in the surf, but you have to or the summer police will come and bang you up.This is why, unless you can spend three months of the year in Portugal, video games are the best place to revel in sunshine. None of these classics will ever be rained off or require the purchase of a Pack-a-Mac. And if you get bored of the endless cobalt skies, you can just switch off and go outside in the rain. Nobody loses.Here then, are our favourite summer games.Out Run (Sega 1986)With its Ferrari convertable, blonde surfer girl and endless scorching freeways, this legendary arcade racer is effectively a love letter to long summer drives. Although the handling model is detailed and challenging, designer Yu Suzuki wanted the game to be a relaxing, enjoyable experience; hence the detailed scenery and a choice of sun-tinged soundtracks. Theelaborate arcade cabinetensured that seaside arcade dwellers had to pay a handsome price to experience the fantasy.California Games (Epyx, 1987)In the California Games surfing section, you had to ride an endless wave, performing tricks in your bright green trunks.During the 1980s, the multi-event sports sim reigned supreme and although everyone pretends to have loved Daley Thompson’s Decathlon, the best titles in this genre were made by US developer Epyx. This instalment features freestyle skateboarding, surfing and frisbee throwing, all rendered in glorious 8bit chunk-o-vision. For C64 and Speccy owners in bleak Thatcher’s Britain, California Games was an almost cruel taste of life in sunny LA.Sonic the Hedgehog (Sega, 1991)Sonic the Hedgehog – so bright, you gotta wear shades.Azure blue skies, twinkling oceans, towering palm trees, Sonic the Hedgehog takes Sega’s fabled love of sunshine and turns up the joy dial to 38-degrees. Even the Casino Night Zone in Sonic 2 feels bright and humid. Sonic does not do drizzle.Super Mario Sunshine (Nintendo, 2002)Super Mario Sunshine pits Mario against the inhabitants of a tropical island that’s been attacked by a mysterious graffiti artist.With its tropical beaches, waterfalls and funfairs, this Gamecube platformer is a joyous vacation from Mushroom Kingdom, retaining much of Super Mario 64’s 3D mastery, while adding new features, including a rucksack that doubles as a water canon and jet pack. Wonderfully colourful and inventive, Sunshine is a bright spot in the GameCube’s often overlooked catalogue.Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (Rockstar 2002)GTA: Vice City – more drugs, deaths and sleaze than a badly run carehome.Rockstar’s 1980s-based gangster adventure stars Tommy Vercetti as a hoodlum who’s been released from jail and is going anywhere but straight. With its woozy orange sunsets, sleaze-ball cast and synth pop soundtrack it is basically an interactive version of Miami Vice – and therefore genius.Dead or Alive: Xtreme Beach Volleyball (Tecmo, 2003)DOA: Beach Volleyball – in which a collection of female game characters take a break from both fightingandconvincing physics.Candy floss, piña coladas, wearing flip-flops – summer is all about guilty pleasures, and Tecmo’s ridiculously crass sports game is the guiltiest of them all. Here, the female warriors from the Dead or Alive fighting game series decide to take a two-week vacation, playing volleyball every day, then blowing their cash in the casino or clothing boutiques. Ugh. It has two things going for it though: the sport sim part reallyispretty good and the soundtrack includes Jesse Hold On by B*Witched.Flower (Thatgamecompany, 2009)Poetic, relaxing and beautiful, Flower has you controlling the breeze as it picks up and collects flower petals floating through the summer skies. Innovative and strangely emotional it set the scene for Thatgamecompany’s magnum opus, Journey.Wii Sports Resort (Nintendo, 2009)Wii Sports Resort: ‘and when we’ve finished this game we can hit the swimming pool bar.’Set on an idyllic beach resort named Wuhu Island, Nintendo’s sequel to the smash hit Wii Sports, gathers a range of 12 gentle holiday-themed activities, such as archery wake boarding and canoeing, into one sunny package. It’s basically like going to a holiday park except you don’t have to spend every night in the resort club, glumly watching French teenagers do the Macarena.Enslaved: Odyssey to the West (Namco, 2010)Enslaved – a holiday from humanity.Ninja Theory’s rendition of the classic Chinese story Journey to the West is set on one of the most luscious depictions of a post-apocalyptic Earth ever conceived. Under a glaring sun, the player wanders through ruined cities that have become vast exotic rain forests, and the game is lit to make everything look almost magical. Also, the fact that the two lead characters bicker constantly makes it feel like a family holiday.
It’s Thursday folks! Today’s screenshot is from forthcoming PS3/Vita fighting game, Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax. Launch copies of the game will come with a bonus CD featuring tracks by Teruhiko Nakagawa (Shinobi) and Naofumi Hataya (NiGHTS into Dreams)!
Silence is rare in Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture – which is strange because everybody is dead.This elegiac adventure game, set in a rural area of Shropshire, imagines the end of humanity coming, not as a nuclear bang, but as a soft, almost seductive whimper. The player finds themselves in an abandoned village shortly after a devastating event of some kind, and by exploring the buildings, pathways and woodlands, must try to piece together what has happened.With no characters around (except for a few sequences in which their ghosts seem to appear as holographic visions telling portions of the backstory), Rapture relies very heavily on environmental sound and music. And Brighton-based developer The Chinese Room has taken a highly complex and ambitious approach to its audio.The most noticeable element from the start however, is the gorgeous orchestral score, composed by co-founder Jessica Curry. The game’s themes and visuals are heavily inspired by the “cosy catastrophe” fiction of John Wyndham and John Christopher, using idyllic English environments – tumbling cottages, country pubs and leafy woodland glades – to conjure a pastoral apocalypse, which the plays into.Related:Everybody's Gone to the Rapture: creating a romantic apocalypse“I wanted to create something timeless,” says Curry. “The score is based around the pastoral ideal, this nostalgia for an England that never existed. It plays on the Englishness of Elgar and Vaughan Williams.”What we hear when we explore the village are these sweeping orchestral themes, loaded with luscious strings and the sort of romantic emotional yearning that characterises the Enigma Variations and Lark Ascending – it is music inextricably tied to the English countryside. To get it right, Curry embarked on a full music production, hiring a string and woodwind orchestra, a violin soloist and for the haunting choral moments, two full, highly experienced choirs, Metro Voices and London Voices.‘Elin Manahan Thomas’s voice is as close to the divine as I think I’ll ever get,’ says Jess Curry. ‘I heard her sing in a concert and immediately knew that she was the only person who could be the voice of Rapture.’The music is the messageImportantly, however, the music does not simply play like a traditional cinematic score – it is interactive. “Some is triggered traditionally like filmic cues,” explains Curry. “But some of it is procedural and triggered by what the player does. Then you have particular songs relating to specific characters.”Of course, dynamic music has been part of video game soundtrack design for 40 years, ever since the famously heartbeat-like Space Invaders tune began to speed up as the aliens approached the bottom of the screen. Since then, composers have experimented with modular soundtracks, switching between different emotional timbres as the player moved between quiet periods of exploration and tense fighting sequences. Musical games like Rez have allowed players to help build the audio through gameplay actions, while titles like Max Payne 3 and Journey have brilliantly used dynamic scores to heighten the emotional impact in very different ways.Rapture, is doing all of these things, but due to the lack of characters in the game, it is also fulfilling a much more directive function, guiding the player around the map, and filling in story details. Each of the previous residents of the village has their own theme, which weaves into the audio as you reach locations meaningful to them. In this way, the score underlines the environmental clues you find, such as notes, signs, and audio recordings.The Chinese Room was also keen for the score to function as a piece of modern classical music in its own right. The symphonic sections are exquisite in this regard, but it also brings in choral themes, as well as discreet songs which sound like Elizabethan ballads. The studio’s other founder, Dan Pinchbeck wrote the lyrics, which hark back to the sort of languid melancholia we see in Shakespeare’s plays.Again, the words play back into the themes of the game. ““It’s not pastiche, we’re trying to use it to make something new,” says Pinchbeck. “We wanted to do something where, if you stripped all of the dialogue out of the game and just have the music, you would still get a really powerful emotional journey.”Sound affectsWorking alongside the music, audio designer Adam Hay has also experimented with ambient effects, carefully modifying a range of countryside sounds. “I think there’s something really comforting in that,” he says. “The whole world is still moving around you. There are loads of wind sounds that are all dynamically mixed and changed as the game progresses to capture the mood of each specific area. I really wanted to do something that might make you just stop for a moment and drink in the atmosphere of the world.”Hay has also drawn procedural audio from the score, so that snippets of music get turned into weird sound effects as you approach important areas, adding a more sinister undertone. “I took Jessica’s music and broke it down into these decayed grimey tape loops,” he says. “The game sort of procedurally rebuilds these elements as you go uncover more scenes and story elements. Jess really pushed that system forward, it was a huge experiment but a very rewarding one. We sort of just kept running with it. We came away from the music recording sessions with loads of elements and chords to feed into it, and it just bridged that gap between the ‘weirdly processed’ and ‘pure organic’ sounds.”Importantly, this musical experimentation was going on from the beginning, and helped inform the rest of the game. “We got the music script and sound effects running at the same time as grey boxing [a method of designing levels and environments with basic scenic objects] – there’s a big interflow between those disciplines right at the beginning of the project,” says Pinchbeck. “We’re not making three-quarters of the game and then bringing in a composer and saying ‘put some music to that’. The early music tests that Jess did were influencing the environmental art, and the art was influencing the script.”Related:No Man’s Sky: how a cult band created the game’s endless musical universeIt’s a fascinating time for game music. Rockstar has done amazing work, not just with its pitch-perfect Grand Theft Auto soundtracks but with the way it has brought in different artists to produce modular scores for games like Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. US-based composer Austin Wintory has brought emotion and drama to games like Monaco and Journey, and post-rock outfit 65daysofstatic has provided the epic No Man’s Sky with an endless cosmic audio experience. Through many years of experimentation, developers are realising that music is as much a storytelling component as dialogue, and that it can be interactive and procedural in ways cinematic scores never can be.“Games are such an amazing space for a composer,” says Curry. “They allow so much freedom. Everyone is trying to write truly interactive music, but it has become a technical obsession for me. Rapture is an experiment in asking: can you guide the player around, gently interact with them but still write really strong uncompromising music? It’s been such a labour of love. I’ve loved it, I’ve hated it and everything in between.”Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture is available on PS4 in August. A soundtrack CD is also being released separately.The Mourning TreeJessica Curry talks us through her favourite sequence from the score.“Each of the six main characters has their own theme in the game and this is Wendy’s. I wanted to give her a theme that reflected the softer side of her character. Wendy has been forced to become tough through circumstance – she is a pensioner and I wanted to write a theme that evoked Wendy as a young woman, when she was still full of hope, but a theme that also explains why she has become the more embattled person that she is now.“There is a melancholy and a beauty in the music and also a rural, folky feel that absolutely ties her to the village of Yaughton where the game is set. Birds are incredibly important thematically in the game and Dan Pinchbeck and I always like to seed little secrets and layers into the lyrics – this song is no exception and it’s perhaps my favourite theme.”
You’ll be seeing a lot more video on Facebook in the near future, and your musings will be easier to access. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors on Wednesday’s second-quarter earnings call that “connecting people with more great video content is an important part” of the company’s future, and the company will improve its searchability – Facebook has already indexed some 2tn posts.Users had sent out some 40% more videos to their lists of friends and followers, Zuckerberg said, and the company was encouraging them to share still more. (Facebook’s own video advertising is more valuable per advertisement than its text and image ads.) “This quarter we updated our newsfeed ranking to help people see more videos they care about,” Zuckerberg said.In many cases, this gives advertisers better access to the users it wants: when Acura rolled out the TLX earlier this year, said COO Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook showed a series of ads featuring the car in odd situations. “Retargeting technology then showed more ads only to people who watched the videos,” Sandberg explained.Facebook’s second-quarter earnings report beat predictions but still failed to please investors on its own merits, as the stock immediately fell by 5.4% in after-hours trading before rallying.This quarter’s spate of after-hours stock slumps – including Twitter and Microsoft in the past few days – following less-stellar-than-expected earnings continued unabated, as the social media company stayed ahead of the market but left shareholders grappling with the stock’s value.But the Facebook dip lasted only minutes, recovering as execs told investors that the company’s core business is thriving. Facebook’s user base is fully 1.49 billion people this quarter – up 13% year-over-year.Facebook continued to rake in vast sums in advertising revenue, with its ad business up a full 43% from an already-healthy $2.68bn to $3.82bn. That accounts for 95% of its $4bn revenue line over the past three months, as ad revenues in other sectors – notably, broadcast television and print media – lose traction.Brian Weiser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said Facebook and Google Display Network (GDN) were the 2,000lb gorillas of digital advertising. “GDN is probably doing $7bn or $8bn of advertising,” Weiser estimated. “GDN and Facebook are probably growing at the same rate right now. There’s next to zero growth for everybody else – [the others] are mostly niche players.”As it grows, that advertising business is migrating increasingly toward your phone: mobile accounted for three-quarters of Facebook’s ad business, a line it proudly broke out for investors.
Related:Tom Brady denies Deflategate 'smoking gun' exists after suspension upheldTom Brady’s four-game suspensionhas angered many Patriots fans, who’ve since questioned the decision. The 20-page ruling by the NFL revealed that the quarterback had his cellphone destroyed, the very cellphone NFL investigators wanted to look at to see if Brady had ordered the footballs deflated.Which raises the question: what are the best ways to destroy text messages forever?Ben Levitan, an engineer who specializes in the design of cellphone networks, said: “Tom Brady should have come to me first.” Levitan outlined some tips on the best ways to delete text messages for good, should you ever need to.Use a magnetIt’s simple, quick and could potentially be claimed as an accident. Just like how a credit card can be wiped when you put a magnet to it, a phone has a similar reaction. Put a strong magnet on your phone and “it will just completely destroy the memory of your phone”, said Levitan.Use a text message shredderTo effectively get rid of text messages, one has to overwrite them in the memory space. “It physically writes garbage into every single memory space on your phone so it can’t be recovered,” Levitan said.Good old-fashioned smashingIf you destroy the chip, the memory will be lost. But this option is tricky. You have to be thorough in your smashing so that the chip is completely destroyed. “If you’re just destroying the keyboard and battery that’s not going to be sufficient,” Levitan said. Smashing one’s phone is also the most conspicuous of the options.Related:Tom Brady's stubbornness over Deflategate has sunk him as low as Roger GoodellIt’s important to note that the above options are only effective if they are used onboth the sender’s and the recipient(s)’ phones. The text messages are stored in both locations.Some phone companies also keep records of sent text messages. They sit on the company’s server for anywhere from three days to three months, depending on the company’s policy. Verizon holds texts for up to five days and Virgin Mobile keeps them for 90 days. AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Sprint do not keep the contents of text messages. Once that time period has expired, the company deletes the content of the messages but holds on to the time and date of the text and who it was sent to.To avoid this problem, you can make use of iMessage, a form of communication between two iPhones. iMessages are not stored on phone companies’ servers.Things not to doDo notsimply delete text messages from your phone. Text messages will be stored even after that. Your phone has limited space but it can still store approximately 1,000 text messages. It completely deletes old text messages after some time, but for the infrequent texter, messages from years and years ago could still be stored away.Do notthrow your phone in water. Generally, it doesn’t delete all of the information from your phone. When a phone hits water, it usually shorts out the battery and kills the power. But if someone were to dry it out for a couple of days and pop in a new battery, it could work again just fine.
Twenty years ago the launch of a new version of Windows merited midnight store openings and a seven-figure payment to use a Rolling Stones song in ads celebrating the new Start menu. Early on Wednesday the release of Windows 10 happened silently, with millions of computers around the world updated over the internet.Related:Windows 10 review – final version of Windows might be Microsoft's best everWindows 10’s biggest new feature? It’s free if you download it within the next year, and will install on machines running Windows 7 or Windows 8. Its second biggest feature? It isn’tWindows 8, which was released in 2012and created widespread puzzlement by submerging the traditional desktop interface beneath big, bright “tiles” and getting rid of the familiar, popular start menu.That puzzlement soon turned to anger, forcing the ejection of the man who had led Windows 8’s development,Steve Sinofsky, and the introduction of Windows 8.1, which, while it didn’t bring the Start menu, did at least let you start off in desktop mode.Now, Microsoft breezilysays, “the familiar Start menu is back”, as though it had been on holiday rather than unceremoniously dumped.Despite the lack of flourish and giant ads, a lot still rides on the success of Windows 10 for Microsoft and its chief executive of 17 months, Satya Nadella . Along with the Office productivity suite and software for web servers, it is still one of the three main sources of revenue and income for the company.Windows’ biggest problem is that it isn’t a contender for mobile phone use, which now outstrips PC use. About 2 billion people worldwide have Apple iPhones or smartphones running Google’s Android software, easily outnumbering the 1.5bn PCs in use.The computing and internet world once revolved around the PC; now it’s the mobile, where Microsoft’s efforts have only garnered about 80 million users of its Windows Phone software, almost all on cheap handsets.Nadella has set a target of getting Windows 10 running on a billion “devices” within three years. With PC sales running at about 300m per year, that’s not quite as ambitious as it initially sounds, but making it free to consumers – businesses and PC makers still have to pay – will help.Related:Windows 10: more Microsoft apps are coming to Android and iPhoneThe question is whether it will make any difference in the longer term.Benedict Evans of the venture capital company Andreessen Horowitz noted in ablog post: “The apps that people want on smartphones are not being written for desktop Windows anyway. Uber doesn’t have a desktop Windows app, and neither does Instacart, Pinterest or Instagram. The apps and services that consumers care about are either smartphone-only or address the desktop using the web. The smartphone is the sun and everything else orbits it.”Windows 10 will continue to be updated gradually; Microsoft says it’s the last “big hit” release, and that future upgrades will be piecemeal, pushed over the internet.Other new features of Windows 10 include:Edge, a new browser to replace the 20-year-old Internet ExplorerCortana, a voice-driven “assistant” that can set up tasks and do searches (like Google’s voice search or Apple’s Siri)Compatibility with Hololens, for a future when we’re all using virtual reality headsetsAutomatic window management, for when you have multiple windows open in different appsContinuum, which will scale the interface up or down - you can plug a Windows tablet into a keyboard and it will behave like a desktop PC; unplug it, and it’s all big swipe-y tiles again.Improved mail, calendar and photo appsOne caution:Windows 10 is a 6GB download, and will happen automatically if you opted for automatic updates (as you should for security). If you have limited broadband capacity, it could use it up quickly.
Twitter is in trouble. With user growth stalled, staff fleeing the company by the hundreds, and the company’s stock still at the bottom of the cliff itfell from in April, sources say the company’s futile obsession with matching its biggest competitor for scale is costing it dearly. And it still doesn’t have a permanent CEO.“Honestly, I think part of the fundamental issue is their relentless fixation on how they compare to Facebook, and I think that’s in some ways a fatal posture,” one former Twitter executive told the Guardian. “I mean, no one will say on the record ‘We compare ourselves relentlessly to Facebook,’ because that’s a losing position, but of course they do.”Indeed, Twitter leadership told investors on Tuesday they were considering revamping the entire look of the service to more closely mirror its “While You Were Away” mobile feature – as Facebook-like as Twitter gets – in an effort to increase general interest in the product.A base of Facebook’s size – about 1.4 billion users against Twitter’s 300 million – isn’t a realistic goal, said Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group, who still has the stock listed as a “buy”.‘They shot for the stars and they only got to the moon, and we’re disappointed’“The management team has focused so much on the aspiration of being ubiquitous, which I always thought was a mistake,” he said, adding that no matter how undramatic his own expectations, “investors have whipsawed back and forth and center” and kept the share price in flux.“They shot for the stars and they only got to the moon, and we’re disappointed,” he said. “The product as it stands isn’t for everybody. Not everybody wants to use Twitter. Not everyone consumes news. The gap is between what management has set for itself and what’s realistic.”That doesn’t seem to matter to Twitter. Jack Dorsey, co-founder and interim CEO, said Twitter needed to be “the most powerful microphone in the world” on the company earnings call on Tuesday evening. Stock fell yet further after the report, off by 12.4% shortly after Wednesday’s open.The company’s recent attempts to increase its user base and keep them from abandoning their accounts at the current rate have failed, Dorsey admitted, but “this is unacceptable”, he told investors, “and we’re not happy about it”. The company does not seem interested in exploring the possibility that it has found all the users it was going to find.Still, there is at least the admission that Twitter is not going to find more users immediately. “We do not expect to see sustained, meaningful growth in MAUs until we start to reach the mass market,” CFO Anthony Noto said on the same call. “We believe that will take a considerable period of time.”When, last quarter, Twitter lowered its projections for user growth in 2015, shares of the social media company cratered despite 71% year-over-year ad revenue growth (which is also slowing – the previous quarter, it was up 97%, the quarter before, 109%). Instagram is projected by eMarketer to leave it in the dust by 2017. The photo-sharing service has already passed Twitter in terms of active monthly users.‘It’s just not a very happy place to work’The growth problem is less the ability of the business to generate cash than the need of Wall Street to see all numbers, especially rates of growth in every category, increase on every earnings call. The ex-exec said that Twitter had run off talent “in an effort to chase those massive numbers”.“I know they’re getting a lot of pressure from the street,” the executive said. “But there have been so many fits and starts and changes in direction that current people in positions of leadership can’t do their jobs. And so they bring in a new group.”That volatility plays out in day-to-day life at the company, as well: high-profile staffers have left the company, from COO Ali Roghani and CFO Mike Gupta to Twitter’s head of communications, Gabriel Stricker, whose departure was announced witha passive aggressive notesuggesting he had been fired.Four-hundred and fifty staffers, in fact, have departed in the last year, according toan analysis of LinkedIn profilesby the Financial Times. Two more left on Tuesday just as earnings were announced: a product director named Todd Jackson, and Christian Oestlien, Twitter’s head of growth.As the executive put it: “It’s just not a very happy place to work.”Meanwhile, Twitter’s corporate culture hasn’t gotten any less cluttered with newcomers – many of them purchased, rather than hired. Among the other companies it’s acquired (and had to incorporate) in the last 12 months: CardSpring, Madbits, Mitro, Twitpic, Zipdial, Nich, Periscope, TenXer, Tellapart and Whetlab. Tellapart alone cost about $533m.So what’s next for the company? No one knows. “The only answer, which I don’t think is feasible, is to say, ‘You know what, we’re going to be the best damn 300 million monthly active user we think we can be,’ and not aim for Facebook-like scale,” said the executive. “But this is the reality, and I feel for them. It’s the reality of being a publicly traded company.”
My father, Bill Dabbs, who has died aged 84, played a key role in the development of the car industry in the UK, including the introduction of its first robot.Bill was born in Southall, London, into a poor family during the Depression, the only boy among eight children. His father, William, suffering from the effects of mustard gas during the first world war, was often unemployed; his mother, Matilda – known as Kathleen – had been in domestic service. In 1940, to keep Bill safe from the London blitz, his parents booked him passage to Canada on the SS City of Benares. Shortly before he was due to leave, they changed their minds; a few days into its voyage, the ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat and 77 evacuee children lost their lives.In between the many jobs Bill held to enable him to go on to further his education, he played the cornet in a silver band and developed a passion for cycling and motorbikes. After an apprenticeship to Pyrene Co in Brentford, Bill graduated with a London University degree in metallurgy in 1955, on the same day that he received his national service call-up papers. He duly served as a bomb disposal engineer in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps.Once demobbed in 1957, Bill moved to Oxford to take up a post as senior metallurgist at Pressed Steel in Cowley, where his colleagues at first found his broad London accent impenetrable. Bill rose to be its chief metallurgist until 1968. The company underwent several mergers and name changes over the years, to become part of the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC), which would be nationalised as British Leyland in 1975.Working at the Austin Morris car division in the early 70s, he introduced one of the first robots in the UK car industry and had a key role in planning a new Mini. He then moved to Coventry to become the director of forward planning at Leyland Cars in 1975, and went on to design the expansion of the Longbridge car plant in Birmingham.Bill predicted the travails of the UK car industry, and was dubbed “the prophet of doom” by one local newspaper. He was eventually a victim of “pruning” by a new chairman appointed to oversee the ailing British Leyland, Michael Edwardes. Bill went on to run the shop and post office in the village of Horsley, Gloucestershire, from 1979 until his retirement, in 1993. He retired to Charminster, Dorset, where he created a workshop refuge he called Shangri La. From the coast nearby, he enjoyed watching the ships and Royal Navy vessels in Portland harbour.Bill always held family as his highest priority.

Uber, the taxi-app firm, is facing legal action over whether it affords its drivers basic rights and treats them as employees rather than “partners” or “contractors”.The suit is being brought by employment law firm, Leigh Day, on behalf of the union for professional drivers, GMB.According to GMB, Uber does not abide by the law in relation to the pay, holiday allowance, or health and safety of its drivers.Nigel MacKay of Leigh Daysaid: “Uber not only pays the drivers but it also effectively controls how much passengers are charged and requires drivers to follow particular routes. As well as this, it uses a ratings system to assess drivers’ performance.“We believe that it’s clear from the way Uber operates that it owes the same responsibilities towards its drivers as any other employer does to its workers. In particular, its drivers should not be denied the right to minimum wage and paid leave. Uber should also take responsibility for its drivers, making sure they take regular rest breaks.”An Uber spokesman defended its relationship with drivers, saying: “One of the main reasons drivers use Uber is because they love being their own boss. As employees, drivers would drive set shifts, earn a fixed hourly wage, and lose the ability to drive elsewhere as well as the personal flexibility they most value.“The reality is that drivers use Uber on their own terms: they control their use of the app.”Steve Garewick, the branch secretary for professional drivers at the GMB, said a number of people driving for Uber had approached them unhappy at the practices at the firm.“There are multiple issues, but we are concerned about quality of life,” he said, estimating that the 75,000 professional drivers operating in London had been joined by around 20,000-30,000 or so Uber drivers in recent years.According to Uber chief executive,Travis Kalanick, Californian based firm, part-owned by Google, hopes to have around 42,000 drivers operating in London by 2016.Garewick said: “Uber say drivers only do x amount of hours – but those are only the times of the journeys, not the times in between and the time driving into London and everything else.“Private hire insurance – if you are very lucky – with a decent no-claims, is around £1,400, but the average is £2000-£2500. So you have to make an awful lot of money on top of car rental, insurance, tax, before you even start to make a living.“If you are earning £6.20 odd [per hour]. Frankly, that is not living.”If you are earning £6.20 per hour, frankly, that is not livingSteve GarewickGarewick said that drivers felt very insecure and unsupported by the firm, and that there are also safety concerns for both drivers and passengers.“If Uber aren’t happy about something, they will just turn you off the system. But also, there’s a lack of trained, quality drivers. So if you have a guy who works in a restaurant the week before and who suddenly rents a vehicle after getting hislicence from TfL, then the question is: what skills have they got to drive? Especially if they are not used to driving. GPS is not always going to be the solution. It’s a safety issue for customers as well.”There are also issues around forthcoming “cross-border” legislation that is slated to come into action in London in September, which will allow a firm that doesn’t have a driver available in a certain area to subcontract to another firm.“Drivers are completely worried about how this is going to affect things, as people will start subcontracting work, coming into London, rocking up to do journeys. You then have an even more flooded market, with everyone cutting rates”, Garewick said.Uber, which has seen thousands of drivers join from private local minicab firms and larger ones such as Addison Lee, argues that its drivers enjoy being self-employed.However, Uber drivers have raised concerns around increased commission paid to Uber (now between 20%-25% depending on type of car), lack of support from Uber’s central London office, and the charge for internet data, which drivers pay even when not actively working (around £3.50 per week).Garewick says he doesn’t know exactly how many Uber drivers have joined GMB because at present the union’s sign-up system does not require a person to disclose who they work for.“But we know there’s been a swell in membership and we know from the turn out we have had that a lot of them are Uber drivers”, he said.Uber is currently alsofacing legal action in Canada, where a £198m lawsuit against the company has been filed by other drivers seeking to stop it operating in the province of Ontario.On Friday, the local council of Nottingham, UK, willmeet to debatewhether or not the firm will be allowed to operate in the area.
Over the past few decades, we have seen enormous changes in how we think about privacy. The emergence of social networks, rise of smartphones, development of cloud computing and growth of location tracking have all affected, in one way or another, how we draw the line between what is private and what is public.But what exactly is privacy? The lawyers Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis defined it in 1890 as the “right to be let alone”. What does the word mean in today’s world? With the imminent expansion of the internet of things, a number of recent high-profile hacks, and with an increasing amount of apps and services needing personal data to function properly, how do we picture our privacy? Do we care about it?Edward Snowden’s revelations about the NSA and GCHQ have exposed how vulnerable our data is to snooping, but are we happy to trade off online privacy for online security? Are we also happy for private companies to use our personal data if it means they can make better products and services?What do you think about privacy in the 21stcentury? We’ve put a few questions below for you to share your thoughts. We’d also like you to share a photo that you think represents privacy in the 21stcentury.To what extent are you happy for the government to monitor your data if it means greater protection from serious crime?To what degree do you trust private companies to keep your data secure?Where do you draw the line between what is and isn’t private?You can share your views with GuardianWitness by clicking on the blue “Contribute” buttons on this article.

Facebook has been told to allow people to use pseudonyms on its site by a German regulator, which has ruled that the site’s “real name” policy violates the right to privacy.The Hamburg data protection authoritysaid on Tuesday thatthe site could not force users to give official ID such as a passport or identity card, nor could it unilaterally change their chosen names to their “real” names on the site.Facebook’s enforcement of its policy, which limits individuals to one account each and requires that those accounts be held under their real name, frequently results in accounts with suspected pseudonyms being locked by the company until the owner can prove their name, or even just the name being changed back by Facebook.Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, said: “As in many other complaints against Facebook, this case demonstrates that the network wants to enforce the so-called real names policy with no regard to national legislation.”He added that the requirement to use a real name violates the rights, enshrined in German law, to use a pseudonym, while requests for digital copies of an official photo ID also contradict the passport and ID card law. In addition, he said that “the unauthorised modification of the pseudonym … blatantly violated the right to informational self-determination and constitutes a deliberate infringement of the Data Protection Act”.Facebook has repeatedly clashed with European data regulators, arguing that it should only be bound by the decisions of the Irish data protection office, since its EU headquarters are based in that nation. In June,after the Belgian privacy commission took the company to court over user tracking, a Facebook spokesperson said that the privacy commissioner should have worked with them “through a dialogue with us at Facebook Ireland and with our regulator, the Irish data protection commissioner”.Caspar pre-emptively rejected that argument: “In this case, Facebook can not retreat to the position that the Irish Data Protection Act sets the standard here. Last year the ECJ blocked that position with case-law related to Google’s search engine. Facebook has economic activity in Gemany with its branch in Hamburg. So: if you like our game, you must play by our rules.”In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said: “We’re disappointed Facebook’s authentic name policy is being revisited, since German courts have reviewed it on multiple occasions and regulators have determined it fully complies with applicable European data protection law. The use of authentic names on Facebook protects people’s privacy and safety by ensuring people know who they’re sharing and connecting with.”Facebook’s real name policy has long been one of the most controversial rules on the site. In February, the site was accused of discriminationafter a number of Native American activistsreported having their accounts suspended or names changed to match European norms.Dana Lone Hill argued that: “Katy Perry’s Left Shark from her Super Bowl halftime show has a Facebook page and we have to prove who we are.”The policy hit the headlines again in June after Zip, a trans former Facebook employee who was instrumental in introducing the company’s custom gender feature, was required to “prove” her name to the company – the same name that had been on her name badge while she worked for Facebook.“We use names that don’t match our ID on Facebook for safety, or because we’re trans, or because we’re just straight up not known by our legal names,”Zip wrote.“Having chosen its policy, Facebook has to enforce it. And because its policy attempts to hammer the reality of names into a constrained model they end up having to make a trade-off in the edge cases. Some people are not allowed to use their names so that everyone else’s can be enforced.”
Windows 10 might be Microsoft’s final version of its 29-year-old operating system, but there are quite a few things it must get right for it to be the next XP – and not the next Vista.The first thing it has to do is convince users that it isn’t Windows 8. For most, Windows 7 had erased the bad memories of Windows Vista, which launched with bugs galore and made for very painful upgrades.But when Windows 8 debuted, with its lack of Start menu and a whole new interface including the hated Charms bar, that good work was undone. Windows 8 was actually a necessary change, giving a new experience for touchscreens, but it angered users looking for that familiar Windows experience.Windows 8.1 added a Start button and now Windows 10 has a reinvented the Start menu with a pinch of the old Windows 7 and a welcome dash of live tiles from Windows 8.Related:Windows 10 review – final version of Windows might be Microsoft's best everBut if the learning curve is too great for desktop users, then we could see another XP moment where users and companies stay on Windows 7, shunning both Windows 8 and 10.Equally, those few who do have Windows tablets must still be served with 10 as they are with 8: a touchscreen-friendly interface that is obvious and follows the same swiping and sliding schemes.The upgrade process must also be smooth and not cause issues, as Microsoft is attempting to encourage users to upgrade Windows on pre-existing computers.The majority of Windows users would never do that, simply getting new versions of Windows on new computers. If the upgrade process is seamless, it doesn’t break users’ applications from Windows 7 or older and doesn’t take forever, it might stand a chance.The users Microsoft needs to tempt with this update will not tolerate failure and will not know what to do to fix problems. Instead, whether it’s Microsoft’s problem or not, they will blame the new operating system and Microsoft and another cycle of hate will ensue.Lastly, Microsoft must deliver on its “Universal” promise, of a large range of devices unified by a common interface and apps that run across phones, tablets, desktops and even the Xbox One games console.If it pulls it off, and persuades developers to stretch their apps from phone to desktop, it could be the software giant’s biggest strength. While computers and tablets aren’t going to be an issue, smartphones might be.Microsoft has neutered it’s ability to produce smartphones after it’s 7,800-person, $7.6bn writeoff of its smartphone division inherited as part of its Nokia purchase.We could see a Surface-style approach to smartphones from Microsoft, producing one or two a year to showcase what Windows 10 can do on a smartphone. But it will need to convince other manufacturers to jump on board the Windows smartphone platform to gain traction in the market and provide that unified experience it has been trumpeting.For Microsoft, Windows 10 is a big launch. It must succeed to ensure a continued presence in the computer space and convince people to update and not just stick with Windows 7.Early signs are positive, but it will be when your average Windows user hits that tempting “upgrade” button and it all goes smoothly that Microsoft will have won.Windows 10 upgrade: how was it for you?
Good news! Birthday wishes are finally meaningless. All the birthday cards you’ve ever posted, all the tender heartfelt messages sent to loved ones, all the dates seared into your memory through years of joy, are now utterly invalidated, so we should all stop bothering and move on with our lives.If you’re wondering who to thank from freeing us of the burden of caring about arbitrary dates, it’s Facebook. Thanks to them, the phrase “Happy Birthday!” is now a hollow shell. Why? This:Friend shared a text from@Facebookwhere to say &quot;Happy Birthday!&quot; You just reply &quot;1&quot; - which is nuts.pic.twitter.com/8FrIBufsrY&mdash; Peter Knox (@peterknox)July 28, 2015It gets worse: FB texts him with EVERY birthday, every day with this message...&mdash; Peter Knox (@peterknox)July 28, 2015The feature is part of Facebook’s SMS notification functionality, which lets users interact with the site through text messages. By default, Facebook will text you if you get sent a message, if you receive a friend request, if someone comments on your status updates and timeline posts or for “everything else”.That latter category has for a long time included birthday notifications, something which there areendlesscomplaintsabout online, but over the last year, Facebook has been rolling out the insta-reply feature.Our advice? If someone posts “Happy Birthday!” on your timeline with that exact capitalisation and punctuation, it’s probably best to unfriend them, block their numbers, and ignore them IRL. They never cared about you anyway.
Microsoft has released Windows 10, the latest, and final, version of its operating system. It’s available as a free upgrade for Windows 7 and 8 users (there was no Windows 9!) Have you upgraded yet? How long did it take? Did you have any problems? Do you like the new Windows? Or is it nothing compared withWindows 3.1? Let us know in the comments below.•Read our four-star review of Windows 10•Learn what Windows 10 means for gamers
It’s Wednesday already! Today’s screenshot is from World of Tanks which is now available on Xbox One.
After several months of hype and expectation, Windows 10 has finally launched, bringing a(nother) new operating system era to computers everywhere. Under the tagline “it’s the Windows you know, only better” Microsoft is promising a range of exciting features, from the return of the Start menu to the arrival of Cortana, a cross-platform digital assistant that promises to be sort of like Paperclip guy but actually useful.Forget all that, though, because the real question is: what will Windows 10 mean for games and gamers? Here are the key features and how they’ll affect PC and Xbox One owners.Xbox Live on PCWindows 10 will place an Xbox Live app on your PC, giving you access to your Xbox friends list, achievements, messages and activity feed, so you’ll be able to keep an eye on your console chums when you’re not actually on your console. Microsoft’s aim is to provide a unified store for developers and publishers, whichmay one day meanthey will be able to upload a single game to Xbox Live which will run on both PC and consoles.The company is adamant that it isn’t trying to compete with Steam – indeed, in itsnews piece on the OS, Microsoft’s Wire blog hinted that Steam, GoG, and Battle.net titles will all be visible and accessible in the Xbox app. However, what it definitelyistrying to do is make it super convenient for game makers to operate within the Windows 10 ecosystem. The idea of being able to upload one app that can be accessible on console, PC, tablet and smartphone will be an enticing one.Elsewhere, PC owners will be able to stream games from their Xbox One to their other PCs and Windows tablets via a local wireless network – handy if you want to play Halo 4 but someone else is hogging the TV. The app also provides Microsoft’s Game DVR package which allows players to seamlessly record and share gaming footage. We’re hoping the company takes this chance to streamline this process however, as Xbox One owners currently need to import Game DVR videos into another app, Upload Studio, to record voice-overs before depositing the footage on OneDrive. We do know that you’ll be able to share your saved clips across PC and Xbox One, and you can use it with PC games that you’re playingthrough Steam and other game services.Anyway, Windows 10 is also compatible with both the standard Xbox One controller and the new Elite pad. There will also be a wireless adaptor available so you don’t have to plug in a micro USB cable.Windows 10 on Xbox OneMicrosoft’s current console is set to geta big update in the autumn, which will include an improved dashboard design (phew) and better multiplayer matchmaking. Apparently, it will be easier for you to find out useful information about your games (such as achievements and fan-made video clips), as well as discovering new titles that may be of interest based on what you’ve already played.The system also makes it easier to access stuff like friends list, party invites and messages from within a game. Microsoft is also building the community elements of the dashboard, improving the friends activity feed and adding a “What’s Trending on Xbox Live” section so you know what everyone else in the world is playing together. This is all pretty promising, as the current dashboard is, let’s say, rather obtuse.Cross-platform multiplayerThanks to Windows 10 integration, it will be possible for developers to make games with cross-platform multiplayer, so Xbox One players will be able to take on PC players. This has been available in a few titles in the past, but without major system-level support it’s been a minor feature. That could all change. Micrsoft has named a range of titles including Fable: Legends and free-to-play battle arena gameGiganticthat will support this feature. Players will also be able to save their game progress between different machines, so you could play a game all day on your PC, then pick up where you left off on the Xbox One.Direct X 12This is the new version of Microsoft’s long-running game development application programming interface (API) and software development kit (SDK) collection, which helps programmers get the most out of PC hardware. The company says Direct X 12 will significantly boost graphics performance on your current hardware, and works with major graphics engines like Unity3D and Unreal Engine 4.4. The benefits are quite technical but they include an update to the Direct3D element of Direct X that will give coderscloser access to graphics hardware, which should in turn mean a more optimised performance.The new API will also includes a new GPI Multiadaptor feature. This allows programmers to improve performance bysharing tasksbetween the integrated graphics chipset in your PC’s CPU and any discrete graphics accelerator card you install whether its from Intel, AMD or Nvidia. In other words, all your graphics hardware will be able towork together in your system.Microsofthas claimedthat over 100 major developers are already integrating Direct X support, including Gears of War: Ultimate Edition. However, the number of games that implement the features will heavily depend on how many players upgrade to Windows 10 (earlier versions of the OS are unlikely to get much in the way of Direct X implementation).As for Xbox One, when its Windows 10 implementation arrives, Direct X 12, will open upsupport for Async shaderswhich speed up graphics rendering by spreading tasks across multiple threads – PlayStation 4 already supports this technique. It also looks as though Direct X 12 will provide developers with more efficient ways to use the system’s eSRAM system memory, though the benefits of that are not currently unclear.Android support (and maybe Apple iOS, too)One unsung but potentially interesting elements of Windows 10 is its support for Android. According to games programmer Byron Atkins Jones, currently working on first-person adventureCaretaker, the OS will allow you to run Android apps on your PC. “They demonstrated this live on stage during the recent Build conference,” he says. “I’m really surprised I’m not seeing this mentioned more because that’s massive – it opens up a whole different world of games to Windows 10.“Microsoft also has iOS covered - although it’s not as easy as running an APK [Android application file]. They have replicated the iOS APIs in Visual studio which means you can open an iOS app project in Visual Studio and it will convert it to a C++ project and compile straight to Windows. They showed this happening live on the stage during the Build keynote. They hinted during another presentation that this is how King were able to bring their games to Windows 10 so quickly.”Virtual realityIn June, Oculus announced that its Rift VR headset would launch with native support for Windows 10(as well as an Xbox One controller, and the ability to stream Xbox One games to a Rift headset) – however, according to one VR developer, the OS won’t work with Rift DK2 until a new Oculus Runtime is released, which should be soon. Later in the same month, Microsoft and Valve hinted at a partnership to ensure Windows 10 compatibility with SteamVR, Valve’s virtual reality platform. What does all that mean? Basically, Microsoft wants Windows 10 to be the operating system of choice for all PC-based virtual reality headsets and technologies.“What we’re doing with Valve and what we’re doing with Oculus is about making Windows 10 the best VR platform both for developers and for consumers,” Microsoft corporate VP Kudo Tsunoda. “People will be able to get the device they want and have it powered by Windows 10. Through our partnership with Valve, we can start getting to a more standard set of APIs so developers don’t have to constantly reinvent everything they’re trying to do in a the VR space: we can say ‘hey this is an API that solves this particular VR problem [on any headset] .“The more you can take this kind of work off the developers, the more they can focus on the experiences themselves. That’s going to be best for VR and best for consumers.”HololensMicrosoft’s standalone augmented-reality headset will run Windows 10 as standard. Users will have access to a range of holographic apps when the headset tech launches sometime later this year or early next year (the company is being really vague about this). We’ve seen several demos,including Minecraft, and despite a limited viewable area, it’s impressive stuff. Here’s a video demo:MinecraftMojang hasannounceda new version of its block-building mega-game catchily entitled Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta. It’ll be free to current owners of the PC version of the game and $10 to everyone else. The fresh iteration allows eight-player co-op building over Xbox Live, and will let you build alongside Pocket Edition players via a later update. It’s a smart move from Microsoft, which bought Minecraft developer Mojang for $2.5bn in 2014: if you want people to download a new version of your OS, release it with a new version of a game that has over 100m registered users.
Microsoft’s last version of Windows is finally here: Windows 10 is arguably the best version of the ubiquitous operating system. But the question is, should you upgrade for free immediately? Or will it be another Windows 8 moment?Windows 10 is a big step towards the Microsoft classic becoming an always-connected operating system for every device, not just PCs, which is continuously updated for free. It’ll run traditional desktop Windows apps, like Windows 7. But it will also run new “universal” apps downloaded from the Windows Store, which Microsoft hopes will become a trusted source of traditional Windows desktop programs as well.Windows 10 on almost every device“Universal” is the key word for Microsoft’s ambitions. Windows 10 will run on everything from smartphones to giant servers, via tablets, convertibles, laptops, all-in-ones, desktop PCs and Surface Hubs with 84in screens. Universal apps will run on all Windows 10 devices and the Xbox One games console, removing the pain of learning different user interfaces for numerous incompatible devices, and making it simpler to share things between them.Obviously, this will depend on how widely adopted Windows 10 becomes. Microsoft hopes to attract a billion users in three years by offering free upgrades to Windows 10 for devices running Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. That’s also why it’s a bit of a hybrid, skewed to appeal to the majority of Windows 7 users, while retaining a tablet mode familiar to Windows 8 users.Installation should take 20 to 90 minutes, depends on your hardware.The Start menu is back, babyThe new smart menu for Windows 10.Photograph: Jack Schofield for the GuardianTheStart menuis Windows 10’s most obvious feature and it will please Windows 7 users. It combines a list of programs similar to Windows 7 with one or two panels of live tiles pulled from Windows 8. Selecting “all programs” shows them in alphabetical order, but the search box familiar to users of Vista and Windows 7 has been moved to the taskbar, where it is more obviously accessible.You can run your traditional desktop programs from either side of the Start menu, from the taskbar, or from XP-style icons on the desktop. If you really don’t want to change the way you work, Windows 10 won’t force you.Windows 10’s Weather App.Photograph: Jack Schofield for the GuardianMicrosoft’s pre-installed apps are improved over Windows 8 versions, particularly Mail and Calendar, Microsoft Photos and thePowerShellcommand system for power users. Windows Media Center, games and gadgets from Windows 7 are gone, but Windows Media Player is still there. Free replacements for missing apps are available in the Windows Store.The Powershell command system.Photograph: Jack Schofield for the GuardianHighlightsWindows 10 also offers some new features to encourage upgrades. The main one isCortana, the personal assistant already familiar to Windows Phone users, but there are others.Windows Hellois a new sign-on system, which includes face recognition if you have an Intel RealSense-compatible camera.Action Centerreplaces the loathed Charms bar from Windows 8. It provides notifications and quick access to common settings.Task View provides an Apple exposé-style view of all running programs at once, though Alt-Tab still works.Multiple virtual desktops are included as standard.Grooveis a new music app/service that replaces Xbox Music. It can import and play your Google Play and iTunes music libraries.Continuumswitches between desktop and tablet modes, and will enable futureWindows 10 smartphones to work like desktop PCs.Microsoft’sDirectX 12is a huge advance, delivering “a massive improvement in performance on the same hardware” (according to AMD). There’s even a built-in DVR to record your gameplay.Finally, there’sEdge, the new, lightweight, standards-oriented browser developed as Project Spartan. Its “show off” feature is that you can write or type annotations onto web pages and email them to people. Edge isn’t finished – it still doesn’t support extensions, for example – but it works very well. And it’s fast.Cortana loadedWindows 10 digital assistant Cortana.Photograph: Jack Schofield for the GuardianThe most Star Trek-like feature is Cortana, a digital assistant that competes with Apple’s Siri and Google Now, who can remember interests such as TV shows and sports teams, as well as previous questions. (Ask Cortana what she thinks of Siri and she says: “I think it’s great that we have Bing in common.”)The X-box games app.Photograph: Jack Schofield for the GuardianI couldn’t get voice to work on aSurface Pro 3running the latest version of Windows 10. Cortana is much less fun if you have to type your questions, and if you do, she will only type her replies not talk to you.VerdictWindows 10 works well, and didn’t break any of my older Windows software. The launch is just the start. Microsoft intends to continuously upgrade it over time, which the user has no choice about as you can’t turn updates off without becoming unsupported. There is a Microsoft tool tohide or block unwanted driver updates, however.Should consumers take the free upgrade? If you use Windows 8 without a touch screen or you’re a gamer, it’s a no-brainer: get it as soon as you can, but back up first of course.If you use Windows 8 on a tablet with no mouse and keyboard, Windows 10 is optional.If you only use Windows 7, you will have some relearning to do, but the Get Started app provides a gentle introduction. You can put it off for four-to-12 months, when the free upgrade offer ends, or until 2020, when Windows 7 becomes unsupported.”Windows 10 is a significant upgrade and the extras are worth a try, especially if you can talk to Cortana. That’s probably not what I would have said three months ago, but using the final build has changed my mind.Pros:Smaller, lighter and faster than previous versions, works better with a mouse and keyboard, Cortana, “In place” upgrades should be painless, free upgradeCons:Requires some relearning, some new features require new hardware, somewhat stark appearance won’t appeal to everyone, may break some very old applicationsOther reviews•Microsoft Surface 3 review: one of the best tablet-laptop hybrids•Surface Pro 3 review: the most lappable tablet yet
Twitter beat expectations – including its own – by a healthy margin on Tuesday, announcing better-than-anticipated earnings even as two more high-profile executives left amid a continuing shakeup. The company’s share price rallied 5.36% in after-hours trading.“Product initiatives we’ve mentioned in previous calls haven’t yet had meaningful impact on growing audience and participation,” interim CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey said on a conference call with investors. “This is unacceptable, and we’re not happy about it.”Twitter is flirting with new features that will change its simple interface to curate tweets more effectively for new users. Its timeline layout, which places the freshest tweets first and is more or less synonymous with the product, may change. “We need to balance recency with relevance,” Dorsey said.The company posted revenues of $502.4m for the period ending 30 June, compared with $312.2m one year earlier and a net loss of $137m. Stagnating growth, however, remains a problem, as does the vacancy in the chief executive’s office. Average monthly users were up 15% year-over-year, to 316 million, but up only 8 million from 308m the quarter before – a rise of just 2.6%.User growth is a metric to which Twitter has paid particular attention, and it is not increasing at a rate that pleases company brass. Advertising accounted for fully $452m of that number and was up $175m from the same quarter in 2014.“Our Q2 results show good progress in monetization, but we are not satisfied with our growth in audience,” said Dorsey. The company is doubling down on its audience goals, casting stagnating subscriber growth as in part a PR problem (the company’s head of communications left abruptly on 16 July).“In order to realize Twitter’s full potential,” Dorsey said, “we must improve in three key areas: ensure more disciplined execution, simplify our service to deliver Twitter’s value faster, and better communicate that value.”Ahead of Twitter’s earnings announcement came the latest in a series of high-profile departures: product director Todd Jackson has left Twitter for Dropbox, and head of growth Christian Oestlien has left for YouTube.Dick Costoloannounced he was leaving the companylast month amid stalled growth, with Dorsey taking the helm on a temporary basis.Rich Greenfield, media and technology analyst at BTIG, said Twitter’s focus on user numbers was the opposite of what it ought to do in order to stay healthy.“We believe Twitter has focused too hard on trying to be perceived by investors and brands as equivalent in scale/reach to Facebook,” he wrote in a note to investors earlier Tuesday, about what he would do as hypothetical CEO of the company.“We believe spending less time trying to monetize syndication and more time building the active, logged-in user experience is a far bigger long-term opportunity. Too many people try Twitter and stop using it because it is too hard/complicated.”
Amazon is proposing that a pristine slice of airspace above the world’s cities and suburbs should be set aside for the deployment of high-speed aerial drones capable of flying robotically with virtually no human interference.The retail giant has taken the next step in its ambition todeliver packages via dronewithin 30 minutes by setting out in greater detail than ever before its vision for the future of robotic flight. It envisages that within the next 10 years hundreds of thousands of small drones – not all of them Amazon’s or devoted to delivery – will be tearing across the skies every day largely under their own automated control.The company’s aeronautics experts propose that a 200ft slab of air – located between 200ft and 400ft from the ground – should be segregated and reserved for state-of-the-art drones equipped with sophisticated communications and sensing equipment and flying at high speeds of 60 knots or more. A further 100ft of airspace – between 400ft and 500ft – would be declared a no-fly zone to act as a buffer between the drones and current conventional aircraft such as passenger and cargo planes, thus mitigating fears about the impact on manned flight or dangers posed to people on the ground.Amazon’s plan, unveiled on Tuesday at a Nasa UTM Convention at Nasa Ames in California, sets out an audacious model for the unleashing of robots above cities and towns across the globe. At the heart of the proposal is the idea that access to the new 200ft slice of airspace would only be granted to those drones equipped with technology that allowed them to fly safely and autonomously.amazon graphic“The way we guarantee the greatest safety is by requiring that as the level of complexity of the airspace increases, so does the level of sophistication of the vehicle,” said Gur Kimchi, vice-president and co-founder of Amazon’s delivery-by-drone project, Prime Air, who addressed the Nasa meeting. “Under our proposal everybody has to be collaborative – vehicles must be able to talk to each other and avoid each other as the airspace gets denser at low altitudes.”Related:Drones: a force for good when flying in the face of disasterAt present there are about 85,000 conventional flights a day in the US involving commercial, cargo, military and general aircraft. Amazon believes that within a decade that number will be dwarfed in the US and globally by unmanned drones flying at low altitudes.Intwo newposition papers, the online retail company lays down the architecture of a new airspace for drones. It calls for a “paradigm shift” that will allow hundreds of thousands of small unmanned aircraft to fly under their own technological steam without the current involvement of humans through air traffic control.To realise that futuristic vision safely, Amazon sets out five capabilities that drones must meet if they are to be allowed to fly inside the new 200ft high-speed corridor. They must have:Sophisticated GPS tracking that allows them to pinpoint their location in real-time and in relation to all other drones around them.A reliable internet connection onboard that allows them to maintain real-time GPS data and awareness of other drones and obstacles.Online flight planning that allows them to predict and communicate their flight path.Communications equipment that allow them to “talk” and collaborate with other drones in the zone to ensure they avoid each other.Sensor-based sense-and-avoid equipment that allows the drones to bypass all other drones and obstacles such as birds, buildings or electric cables.Under this scenario, drones would take to the skies with virtually no human interaction at all. “We aim to have high levels of safe automation so that the only time intervention is needed is in emergency situations, national security crises and the like,” Kimchi told the Guardian.The image of the skies filling up with autonomous drones sounds like the script of a Hollywood sci-fi movie. But advances in GPS technology, sensors and internet-based communications are happening so rapidly that the concept is no longer in the realm of fantasy.Before it is realised, however, pioneers like Amazon will have to assuage the doubts ofprivacy activistsconcerned about the impact on civil liberties and of government regulators worried about how flying robots would interact with manned aircraft. Amazon has been in along-running tusslewith the regulatory Federal Aviation Administration, which the company has accused of dragging its feet over drone innovation.The other interested party that may take some convincing are amateur drone hobbyists and modellers. Under current rules in the US, they are allowed to fly their aircraft within line of sight up to 400ft as long as they stay away from airports and other out-of-bounds areas.Under Amazon’s proposals, by contrast, hobbyists would only be allowed to fly within the new 200ft-400ft corridor if their vehicles were equipped with the latest hyper-sophisticated gadgetry for autonomous flight. Otherwise, they would have their activities confined to geographically demarcated airfields in relatively unpopulated areas that would be set aside specifically for the purpose.Brendan Schulman, who has been building and flying drones as a hobbyist for 20 years and is now a senior executive at the drone manufacturer DJI, said that by far the greatest use of unmanned aerial vehicles today was by amateurs. “That’s currently by far the most common use of the technology, so before you disrupt their experience you want to think carefully about what slice of airspace would really be needed by these new technologies.”Kimchi said that Amazon did not envisage much change in the way modelers operate under the new proposal. “They will have low-risk areas in more rural areas where they can continue to fly safely to their heart’s content.”
As a man in my mid-30s in the year 2015, I spend the bulk of my life diligently and repeatedly carrying out one simple task – ignoring the prospect of my inevitable death. It’s quite easy, partly because I don’t appear to be imminently approaching my demise, but mainly because I’ve successfully barricaded myself inside an impenetrable fort of shiny distractions.If I notice a story about a freak accident that resulted in a tragic loss of life, I bury my head in Netflix for a bit. When I realise that I’m incrementally growing closer to the average age of people mentioned in obituaries, I stab a bunch of strangers on Assassin’s Creed until the tightness in my chest goes away. And if I’m struck by a sudden awareness that the human body is a fragile, error-strewn thing, and that I could easily be taken out by a plane or a car or a virus or an exploding oven or the accidental consumption of raw camel’s milk without so much as a second’s notice? Well, I hammer out a load of unfunny fart jokes on Twitter. There, there. Everything’s OK. Everything’s OK.But now, upsettingly, these distractions are turning against us. In what might eventually become a good idea, but currently seems like the worst one yet, social media has started to remind us of our own mortality. Facebook has introduced a new feature for UK users thatlets you choose who will take control of your account once you’re dead.It’s all done so breezily. Right there in the security settings, below the bit that lets you toggle between celsius and fahrenheit, you’ll find a bar that allows you to nominate a “legacy contact”. “A legacy contact is someone who you choose to manage your account after you pass away,” chirps Facebook. “They’ll be able to do things like pin a post on your Timeline, respond to new friend requests and update your profile picture.”Now, there’s a clear logic to this move. Friends of mine with family members who died unexpectedly have mentioned the struggle of knowing what to do about their Facebook pages, which can become anything from loving memorials to upsetting reminders of the people they’ve lost. In this respect, being able to hand over the whole thing to a friend or relative should help to ease some of the pain and confusion that death invariably stirs up.That said, actually nominating a legacy contact is harder than it looks, not least because of its brutal implication. The simple fact that it exists at all is a stark reminder that life is finite. Which is such a bummer. Facebook isn’t the place to go to learn that you’re going to die. It’s the place to go to wish you were already dead, because all your friends ever do ispost baby photosand scrawl unintelligible rants about Ukip.It’s like Instagram interrupting your feed of rainbows and dinners to tell you that you will perish in a state of impoverished misery unless you immediately start paying 30% of your monthly earnings into a private pension fund.So, who to nominate? I’d feel weird giving the responsibility to my wife ormy son, because they’d already be exhausted by all the harrowing obligations that death entails. My mum? She has been on Facebook for three years and still hasn’t worked out how to upload a photo of herself, so that’s a no, too. My brother? Given the opportunity to update my profile picture – even in the immediate aftermath of my tragic death – he’d almost certainly dig out a photo in which I’m simultaneously chewing and blinking.I refuse to be Milibanded, even in death, so he’s out.To its credit, Facebook saw this conundrum coming, which is why it has introduced a box for you to tick if you want your account to be deleted permanently following your death. This is, objectively, the best idea of all, because –as the excruciating social media archive app Timehop demonstrateson a daily basis – you will grow to become abjectly mortified by everything you did in your 20s. Do you want your lasting gift to the world to be a blurry photo of you wearing a horrible nylon shirt and drinking an elaborate cocktail in an obnoxiously ironic way? No, of course you don’t.But, at the same time, this is a hard button to click. It means erasing yourself. It means telling the world that, ultimately, you think you’re insignificant. Of course, if you really thought that, you wouldn’t be onsocial mediain the first place, since social media is basically a vehicle for you to remind people again and again and again that you exist.Perhaps the best bet would be to put the keys to my Facebook page up for auction. Whoever bids the most, and promises to pay upfront for the privilege, will gain full control of it in perpetuity. Any huge corporations who want to spread their message of multinational capitalism to 480 grieving users, do get in touch. The late Stuart Heritage, in association with GlaxoSmithKline.

Oh, Google+, we hardly knew you. Because we never used you. Even though your parent company systematically forced us all into signing up for accounts. You were the new odd kid in class nobody wanted to talk to, but we were all forced to.Now, in a blog post entitled “Everything in its right place”, which may or may not be aRadiohead reference, the company has announced it is scaling back the reach of Google+, its underperforming social network.Google has until now made certain services, such as YouTube channels and accounts, inaccessible to those without Google+, ostensibly under the guise of providing users with a more seamless experience.This also allowed Google to report inflated numbers of users, few of whom were actually active. According to the company, Google+ has540 million usersbut, asthe New York Times reportedin 2014, only around half of those actually used it.Google+ will remain, but changes will mean Google users will only need a basic account in future to access services, rather than having to sign up to the social network. Its popular photos tools alreadymoved to the standalone Google Photosapp in May.In the blogpost, Bradley Horowitz, vice president of Google streams, photos and sharing, wrote: “People have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier. But we’ve also heard that it doesn’t make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use.”He announced that a basic Google account will be all users need to “share content, communicate with contacts and create a YouTube channel and more”, rather than a specific Plus account.Specifically on the issue of Google+ in search, he added: “As always, your underlying Google account won’t be searchable or followable, unlike public Google+ profiles.“And for people who already created Google+ profiles but don’t plan to use Google+ itself, we’ll offer better options for managing and removing those public profiles.”Google’s new changes to Plus will be rolled out over the following months, and will not “happen overnight”. But users arewarned not to delete their Google+ accountsimmediately, due to the delay in changes coming into effect.•Google+ isn’t going anywhere, says new boss David Besbris
Motorola is launching a new version of its popular low-priced Moto G and two new versions of its Moto X, as it attempts to compete at both the low and high end of the smartphone market.It is continuing its strategy of producing Android devices that undercut the competition, challenging both inexpensive Chinese manufacturers and the premium Samsung and Apple brands.The Moto G launched in 2013 andredefined how gooda low-cost smartphone could be. The new, third generation Moto G is less revolutionary and more evolutionary, picking up features but also rising in cost.The new Moto G starts at £159 with 8GB of storage, which is £20-30 more than theoriginal phoneand thesecond generation that launched last year. For that extra money Motorola’s added waterproofing to IP67 standards, something typically found in only high-end devices, and a new improved 13-megapixel camera.The Moto G can be customised using Motorola’s Moto Maker online store, but also has removable backs.Photograph: MotorolaSince the original G’s launch, Motorola has launch another lower cost model at £90called the Moto E, which might explain the increase in the G’s price.“We’ve tried to bring as many of our high-end features from Moto X to the G as quickly as possible, but we’ve also got Moto E stepping up to fill needs at the low end,” said Adrienne Hayes head of marketing at Motorola.The third generation Moto G has a 5in 720p display, quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor, options for 8 and 16GB of storage and a microSD slot, a 5MP selfie camera and 4G.Having secured victory at the low-end with the Moto G, which propelled Motorola from zero to 6% market share in the UK, one of the most competitive smartphone markets in the world, Motorola is seeking to take a bite out of Apple.The Moto X Play and Style are two larger, flagship devices, which aim to beat Apple and Samsung at their own games and undercut them on price.Moto X Play is Motorola’s smaller smartphonePhotograph: MotorolaThe Moto X Play costs £299 and has a 5.5in 1080p screen, two-day battery life and a new 21-megapixel camera on the back and a 5-megapixel selfie camera on the front with a flash.Hayes says: “We’ve tried to concentrate on the pain points of smartphone customers: battery life, camera and price.”The Moto X Play will be available in August. Motorola also has a larger 5.7in version called the Moto X Style, which has a high screen-to-body ratio making the overall device size relatively small for the size of screen.The largest of Motorola’s new phones has a 5.7in screen, which is 0.3in smaller than the Motorola-made Google Nexus 6.Photograph: MotorolaThe Moto X Style will cost £359 starting in September and has similar specifications to its smaller 5.5in brother including a 1080p screen, but has shorter battery life and a better 21-megapixel camera.Hayes says: “We’ve spent a significant amount of time and research on the camera and have won independent awards to analysts putting it in the top three phones for the camera in the world. It ranked ahead of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.”The X Style also claims to be the fastest charging smartphone available, with eight hours of use out of a 15 minute charge using Motorola’s Turbo USB charger.All three of Motorola’s new smartphones run Android 5 Lollipop, with a view to being upgraded to Android M when it is released later this year.Motorola has an uphill battle against the incumbents of Samsung and Apple at the high end. The now Lenovo-owned company, hopes that cheaper costs and similar or better specifications will be enough to tempt users upgrading from the likes of Apple’s iPhone 5S or Samsung’s Galaxy S5 or Note 4.The lack of 2K screens, which are common on high-end competition from LG, Samsung and others could hold it back, to which Hayes says: “We’re not convinced that consumers can see the difference between 1080p and 2K screens in day-to-day use.”•Google Nexus 6 review: big is beautiful, but not manageable•Motorola Moto X review: listening out for your dulcet tones•Motorola Moto G 2014 review: the best all-round budget smartphone
